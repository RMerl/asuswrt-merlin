# This  script was  written  by  Jim Isaacson  <jcisaac@crl.com>.  It is
# designed to work  as a script to use the  SecureCARD(tm) device.  This
# little device is mated with a central controller. The number displayed
# on this card changes every so often and  you need to enter  the number
# along with your user account name in order to gain access.  Since chat
# is based upon fixed strings this procedure will not work with chat.
#
# It is included by permission. An excellent reference for the expect
# program used by this script is in the book:
