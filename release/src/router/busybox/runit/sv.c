/* Taken from http://smarden.sunsite.dk/runit/sv.8.html:

sv - control and manage services monitored by runsv

sv [-v] [-w sec] command services
/etc/init.d/service [-w sec] command

The sv program reports the current status and controls the state of services
monitored by the runsv(8) supervisor.

services consists of one or more arguments, each argument naming a directory
service used by runsv(8). If service doesn't start with a dot or slash,
it is searched in the default services directory /var/service/, otherwise
relative to the current directory.

command is one of up, down, status, once, pause, cont, hup, alarm, interrupt,
1, 2, term, kill, or exit, or start, stop, restart, shutdown, force-stop,
force-reload, force-restart, force-shutdown.

The sv program can be sym-linked to /etc/init.d/ to provide an LSB init
script interface. The service to be controlled then is specified by the
base name of the "init script".

status
    Report the current status of the service, and the appendant log service
    if available, to standard output.
up
    If the service is not running, start it. If the service stops, restart it.
down
    If the service is running, send it the TERM signal, and the CONT signal.
    If ./run exits, start ./finish if it exists. After it stops, do not
    restart service.
once
    If the service is not running, start it. Do not restart it if it stops.
pause cont hup alarm interrupt quit 1 2 term kill
    If the service is running, send it the STOP, CONT, HUP, ALRM, INT, QUIT,
    USR1, USR2, TERM, or KILL signal respectively.
exit
    If the service is running, send it the TERM signal, and the CONT signal.
    Do not restart the service. If the service is down, and no log service
    exists, runsv(8) exits. If the service is down and a log service exists,
    send the TERM signal to the log service. If the log service is down,
    runsv(8) exits. This command is ignored if it is given to an appendant
    log service.

sv actually looks only at the first character of above commands.

Commands compatible to LSB init script actions:

status
    Same as status.
start
    Same as up, but wait up to 7 seconds for the command to take effect.
    Then report the status or timeout. If the script ./check exists in
    the service directory, sv runs this script to check whether the service
    is up and available; it's considered to be available if ./check exits
    with 0.
stop
    Same as down, but wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become down.
    Then report the status or timeout.
restart
    Send the commands term, cont, and up to the service, and wait up to
    7 seconds for the service to restart. Then report the status or timeout.
    If the script ./check exists in the service directory, sv runs this script
    to check whether the service is up and available again; it's considered
    to be available if ./check exits with 0.
shutdown
    Same as exit, but wait up to 7 seconds for the runsv(8) process
    to terminate. Then report the status or timeout.
force-stop
    Same as down, but wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become down.
    Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the kill command.
force-reload
    Send the service the term and cont commands, and wait up to
    7 seconds for the service to restart. Then report the status,
    and on timeout send the service the kill command.
force-restart
    Send the service the term, cont and up commands, and wait up to
    7 seconds for the service to restart. Then report the status, and
    on timeout send the service the kill command. If the script ./check
    exists in the service directory, sv runs this script to check whether
    the service is up and available again; it's considered to be available
    if ./check exits with 0.
force-shutdown
    Same as exit, but wait up to 7 seconds for the runsv(8) process to
    terminate. Then report the status, and on timeout send the service
    the kill command.

Additional Commands

check
    Check for the service to be in the state that's been requested. Wait up to
    7 seconds for the service to reach the requested state, then report
    the status or timeout. If the requested state of the service is up,
    and the script ./check exists in the service directory, sv runs
    this script to check whether the service is up and running;
    it's considered to be up if ./check exits with 0.

Options

-v
    wait up to 7 seconds for the command to take effect.
    Then report the status or timeout.
-w sec
    Override the default timeout of 7 seconds with sec seconds. Implies -v.

Environment

SVDIR
    The environment variable $SVDIR overrides the default services directory
    /var/service.
SVWAIT
    The environment variable $SVWAIT overrides the default 7 seconds to wait
    for a command to take effect. It is overridden by the -w option.

Exit Codes
    sv exits 0, if the command was successfully sent to all services, and,
    if it was told to wait, the command has taken effect to all services.

    For each service that caused an error (e.g. the directory is not
    controlled by a runsv(8) process, or sv timed out while waiting),
    sv increases the exit code by one and exits non zero. The maximum
    is 99. sv exits 100 on error.
