A small SSL helper for busybox wget.

Precompiled static binary may be found in
http://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/

Build instructions:

* Unpack wolfssl-3.6.8.zip
* Build it:
  ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared && make
* Drop this directory into wolfssl-3.6.8/ssl_helper
* Run ssl_helper.sh to compile and link the helper

Usage: "ssl_helper -d FILE_DESCRIPTOR" where FILE_DESCRIPTOR is open to the peer.

In bash, you can do it this way:
$ ssl_helper -d3 3<>/dev/tcp/HOST/PORT

Stdin will be SSL-encrypted and sent to FILE_DESCRIPTOR.
Data from FILE_DESCRIPTOR will be decrypted and sent to stdout.
