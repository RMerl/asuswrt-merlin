Build instructions:

* Unpack matrixssl-3-4-2-open.tgz.
* Build it: "make"
* Drop this directory into matrixssl-3-4-2-open/ssl_helper
* Run ssl_helper.sh to compile and link the helper

Usage: "ssl_helper -d <FILE_DESCRIPTOR>" where FILE_DESCRIPTOR is open to the peer.

In bash, you can do it this way:
$ ssl_helper -d3 3<>/dev/tcp/HOST/PORT

Stdin will be SSL-encrypted and sent to FILE_DESCRIPTOR.
Data from FILE_DESCRIPTOR will be decrypted and sent to stdout.

The plan is to adapt it for wget https helper, and for ssl support in nc.
