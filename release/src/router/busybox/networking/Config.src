config FEATURE_IPV6
	bool "Enable IPv6 support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable IPv6 support in busybox.
	  This adds IPv6 support in the networking applets.

config FEATURE_UNIX_LOCAL
	bool "Enable Unix domain socket support (usually not needed)"
	default n
	help
	  Enable Unix domain socket support in all busybox networking
	  applets.  Address of the form local:/path/to/unix/socket
	  will be recognized.

	  This extension is almost never used in real world usage.
	  You most likely want to say N.

config FEATURE_PREFER_IPV4_ADDRESS
	bool "Prefer IPv4 addresses from DNS queries"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_IPV6
	help
	  Use IPv4 address of network host if it has one.

	  If this option is off, the first returned address will be used.
	  This may cause problems when your DNS server is IPv6-capable and
	  is returning IPv6 host addresses too. If IPv6 address
	  precedes IPv4 one in DNS reply, busybox network applets
	  (e.g. wget) will use IPv6 address. On an IPv6-incapable host
	  or network applets will fail to connect to the host
	  using IPv6 address.

config VERBOSE_RESOLUTION_ERRORS
	bool "Verbose resolution errors"
	default n
	help
	  Enable if you are not satisfied with simplistic
	  "can't resolve 'hostname.com'" and want to know more.
	  This may increase size of your executable a bit.

	  Add support for extended option like:
	    setageing, setfd, sethello, setmaxage,
	    setpathcost, setportprio, setbridgeprio,
	    stp
	  This adds about 600 bytes.

config FEATURE_BRCTL_SHOW
	bool "Support show"
	default y
	depends on BRCTL && FEATURE_BRCTL_FANCY
	help
	  Add support for option which prints the current config:

	  Enable all kinds of FTP upload commands (-w option)

config FEATURE_FTPD_ACCEPT_BROKEN_LIST
	bool "Enable workaround for RFC-violating clients"
	default y
	depends on FTPD
	help
	  Some ftp clients (among them KDE's Konqueror) issue illegal
	  "LIST -l" requests. This option works around such problems.
	  It might prevent you from listing files starting with "-" and
	  it increases the code size by ~40 bytes.
	  Most other ftp servers seem to behave similar to this.

config FEATURE_FTP_AUTHENTICATION
	bool "Enable authentication"
	default y
	depends on FTPD
	help
	  Enable basic system login as seen in telnet etc.

config FTPGET
	bool "ftpget"

	  "Range: bytes=NNN-[MMM]" header. Allows for resuming interrupted
	  downloads, seeking in multimedia players etc.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_SETUID
	bool "Enable -u <user> option"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	  This option allows the server to run as a specific user
	  rather than defaulting to the user that starts the server.
	  Use of this option requires special privileges to change to a
	  different user.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_BASIC_AUTH
	bool "Enable Basic http Authentication"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	  Utilizes password settings from /etc/httpd.conf for basic

	  when specific URLs are requested.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_CONFIG_WITH_SCRIPT_INTERPR
	bool "Support for running scripts through an interpreter"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_HTTPD_CGI
	help
	  This option enables support for running scripts through an
	  interpreter. Turn this on if you want PHP scripts to work
	  properly. You need to supply an additional line in your
	  httpd.conf file:
	  *.php:/path/to/your/php

config FEATURE_HTTPD_SET_REMOTE_PORT_TO_ENV
	bool "Set REMOTE_PORT environment variable for CGI"

	  Use of this option can assist scripts in generating
	  references that contain a unique port number.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_ENCODE_URL_STR
	bool "Enable -e option (useful for CGIs written as shell scripts)"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	  This option allows html encoding of arbitrary strings for display
	  by the browser. Output goes to stdout.
	  For example, httpd -e "<Hello World>" produces
	  "&#60Hello&#32World&#62".

config FEATURE_HTTPD_ERROR_PAGES
	bool "Support for custom error pages"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	  This option allows you to define custom error pages in
	  the configuration file instead of the default HTTP status
	  error pages. For instance, if you add the line:
	        E404:/path/e404.html
	  in the config file, the server will respond the specified
	  '/path/e404.html' file instead of the terse '404 NOT FOUND'
	  message.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_PROXY
	bool "Support for reverse proxy"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	  This option allows you to define URLs that will be forwarded
	  to another HTTP server. To setup add the following line to the
	  configuration file
	        P:/url/:http://hostname[:port]/new/path/
	  Then a request to /url/myfile will be forwarded to
	  http://hostname[:port]/new/path/myfile.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_GZIP
	bool "Support for GZIP content encoding"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD

	default y
	depends on IFCONFIG
	help
	  Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device driver
	  supports  this  operation. Currently, we only support the 'ether'
	  class.

config FEATURE_IFCONFIG_BROADCAST_PLUS
	bool "Set the broadcast automatically"
	default y
	depends on IFCONFIG
	help
	  Setting this will make ifconfig attempt to find the broadcast
	  automatically if the value '+' is used.

config IFENSLAVE
	bool "ifenslave"

config IFUPDOWN
	bool "ifupdown"
	default y
	help
	  Activate or deactivate the specified interfaces. This applet makes
	  use of either "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command to actually
	  configure network interfaces. Therefore, you will probably also want
	  to enable either IFCONFIG and ROUTE, or enable
	  FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP and the various IP options. Of
	  course you could use non-busybox versions of these programs, so
	  against my better judgement (since this will surely result in plenty
	  of support questions on the mailing list), I do not force you to
	  enable these additional options. It is up to you to supply either
	  "ifconfig", "route" and "run-parts" or the "ip" command, either
	  via busybox or via standalone utilities.

config IFUPDOWN_IFSTATE_PATH
	string "Absolute path to ifstate file"
	default "/var/run/ifstate"
	depends on IFUPDOWN
	help
	  ifupdown keeps state information in a file called ifstate.
	  Typically it is located in /var/run/ifstate, however
	  some distributions tend to put it in other places
	  (debian, for example, uses /etc/network/run/ifstate).
	  This config option defines location of ifstate.

config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP
	bool "Use ip applet"
	default y
	depends on IFUPDOWN
	help

	help
	  Use the busybox iproute "ip" applet to implement "ifupdown".

	  If left disabled, you must install the full-blown iproute2
	  utility or the  "ifup" and "ifdown" applets will not work.

config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IFCONFIG_BUILTIN
	bool "Use busybox ifconfig and route applets"

	select IFCONFIG
	select ROUTE
	help
	  Use the busybox iproute "ifconfig" and "route" applets to
	  implement the "ifup" and "ifdown" utilities.

	  If left disabled, you must install the full-blown ifconfig
	  and route utilities, or the  "ifup" and "ifdown" applets will not
	  work.

config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IPV4

###	  networks.

config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_MAPPING
	bool "Enable mapping support"
	default y
	depends on IFUPDOWN
	help
	  This enables support for the "mapping" stanza, unless you have
	  a weird network setup you don't need it.

config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_EXTERNAL_DHCP
	bool "Support for external dhcp clients"
	default n
	depends on IFUPDOWN
	help
	  This enables support for the external dhcp clients. Clients are
	  tried in the following order: dhcpcd, dhclient, pump and udhcpc.
	  Otherwise, if udhcpc applet is enabled, it is used.
	  Otherwise, ifup/ifdown will have no support for DHCP.

	  A daemon for the TELNET protocol, allowing you to log onto the host
	  running the daemon. Please keep in mind that the TELNET protocol
	  sends passwords in plain text. If you can't afford the space for an
	  SSH daemon and you trust your network, you may say 'y' here. As a
	  more secure alternative, you should seriously consider installing the
	  very small Dropbear SSH daemon instead:
		http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html

	  Note that for busybox telnetd to work you need several things:
	  First of all, your kernel needs:
		  CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y

	  Next, you need a /dev/pts directory on your root filesystem:

		  $ ls -ld /dev/pts
		  drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Sep 23 13:21 /dev/pts/

	  Next you need the pseudo terminal master multiplexer /dev/ptmx:

		  $ ls -la /dev/ptmx
		  crw-rw-rw-  1 root tty 5, 2 Sep 23 13:55 /dev/ptmx

	  Any /dev/ttyp[0-9]* files you may have can be removed.
	  Next, you need to mount the devpts filesystem on /dev/pts using:

		  mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts

	  You need to be sure that busybox has LOGIN and
	  FEATURE_SUID enabled. And finally, you should make
	  certain that Busybox has been installed setuid root:

		chown root.root /bin/busybox
		chmod 4755 /bin/busybox

	  with all that done, telnetd _should_ work....


config FEATURE_TELNETD_STANDALONE

	  Example inetd.conf line (note "wait", not usual "nowait"):

	  telnet stream tcp wait root /bin/telnetd telnetd -w10

	  In this example, inetd passes _listening_ socket_ as fd 0
	  to telnetd when connection appears.
	  telnetd will wait for connections until all existing
	  connections are closed, and no new connections
	  appear during 10 seconds. Then it exits, and inetd continues
	  to listen for new connections.

	  This option is rarely used. "tcp nowait" is much more usual
	  way of running tcp services, including telnetd.
	  You most probably want to say N here.
