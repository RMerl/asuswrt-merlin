/* Written by Hrvoje Niksic.  Parts are loosely inspired by the
   cookie patch submitted by Tomasz Wegrzanowski.

   This implements the client-side cookie support, as specified
   (loosely) by Netscape's "preliminary specification", currently
   available at:

       http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html

   rfc2109 is not supported because of its incompatibilities with the
   above widely-used specification.  rfc2965 is entirely ignored,
   since popular client software doesn't implement it, and even the
   sites that do send Set-Cookie2 also emit Set-Cookie for
   compatibility.  */

/* Cookie jar serves as cookie storage and a means of retrieving
   cookies efficiently.  All cookies with the same domain are stored
   in a linked list called "chain".  A cookie chain can be reached by
   looking up the domain in the cookie jar's chains_by_domain table.

   For example, to reach all the cookies under google.com, one must
   execute hash_table_get(jar->chains_by_domain, "google.com").  Of
   course, when sending a cookie to `www.google.com', one must search

     hand, "sso.redhat.de" should be able to set a cookie for
     ".redhat.de".

     The only marginally sane way to handle this I can think of is to
     reject on the basis of the length of the second-level domain name
     (but when the top-level domain is unknown), with the assumption
     that those of three or less characters could be reserved.  For
     example:

          .co.org -> works because the TLD is known
           .co.uk -> doesn't work because "co" is only two chars long
          .com.au -> doesn't work because "com" is only 3 chars long
          .cnn.uk -> doesn't work because "cnn" is also only 3 chars long (ugh)
          .cnn.de -> doesn't work for the same reason (ugh!!)
         .abcd.de -> works because "abcd" is 4 chars long
      .img.cnn.de -> works because it's not trying to set the 2nd level domain
       .cnn.co.uk -> works for the same reason

    That should prevent misuse, while allowing reasonable usage.  If
    someone knows of a better way to handle this, please let me
    know.  */
