/* INTERFACE:

   Hash tables are a technique used to implement mapping between
   objects with near-constant-time access and storage.  The table
   associates keys to values, and a value can be very quickly
   retrieved by providing the key.  Fast lookup tables are typically
   implemented as hash tables.

   The entry points are
     hash_table_new       -- creates the table.
     hash_table_destroy   -- destroys the table.
     hash_table_put       -- establishes or updates key->value mapping.
     hash_table_get       -- retrieves value of key.
     hash_table_get_pair  -- get key/value pair for key.
     hash_table_contains  -- test whether the table contains key.
     hash_table_remove    -- remove key->value mapping for given key.
     hash_table_for_each  -- call function for each table entry.
     hash_table_iterate   -- iterate over entries in hash table.
     hash_table_iter_next -- return next element during iteration.
     hash_table_clear     -- clear hash table contents.
     hash_table_count     -- return the number of entries in the table.

   The hash table grows internally as new entries are added and is not
   limited in size, except by available memory.  The table doubles
   with each resize, which ensures that the amortized time per
   operation remains constant.

   If not instructed otherwise, tables created by hash_table_new
   consider the keys to be equal if their pointer values are the same.
   You can use make_string_hash_table to create tables whose keys are
   considered equal if their string contents are the same.  In the
   general case, the criterion of equality used to compare keys is
   specified at table creation time with two callback functions,
   "hash" and "test".  The hash function transforms the key into an
   arbitrary number that must be the same for two equal keys.  The
   test function accepts two keys and returns non-zero if they are to
   be considered equal.

   Note that neither keys nor values are copied when inserted into the
   hash table, so they must exist for the lifetime of the table.  This
   means that e.g. the use of static strings is OK, but objects with a
   shorter life-time probably need to be copied (with strdup() or the
   like in the case of strings) before being inserted.  */

/* IMPLEMENTATION:

   The hash table is implemented as an open-addressed table with
   linear probing collision resolution.

   The above means that all the cells (each cell containing a key and
   a value pointer) are stored in a contiguous array.  Array position
   of each cell is determined by the hash value of its key and the
   size of the table: location := hash(key) % size.  If two different
   keys end up on the same position (collide), the one that came
   second is stored in the first unoccupied cell that follows it.
   This collision resolution technique is called "linear probing".

   There are more advanced collision resolution methods (quadratic
   probing, double hashing), but we don't use them because they incur
   more non-sequential access to the array, which results in worse CPU
   cache behavior.  Linear probing works well as long as the
   count/size ratio (fullness) is kept below 75%.  We make sure to
   grow and rehash the table whenever this threshold is exceeded.

   Collisions complicate deletion because simply clearing a cell
   followed by previously collided entries would cause those neighbors
   to not be picked up by find_cell later.  One solution is to leave a
   "tombstone" marker instead of clearing the cell, and another is to
   recalculate the positions of adjacent cells.  We take the latter
   approach because it results in less bookkeeping garbage and faster
   retrieval at the (slight) expense of deletion.  */

   value, the table is resized.  */

   ITEMS is the number of items that the table can accept without
   needing to resize.  It is useful when creating a table that is to

   the regrows are a waste of time, and specifying ITEMS correctly

   Note that hash tables grow dynamically regardless of ITEMS.  The

   If hash and test callbacks are not specified, identity mapping is

/* Guidelines for creating custom hash and test functions:

   - The test function returns non-zero for keys that are considered
     "equal", zero otherwise.

   - The hash function returns a number that represents the
     "distinctness" of the object.  In more precise terms, it means
     that for any two objects that test "equal" under the test
     function, the hash function MUST produce the same result.

     This does not mean that all different objects must produce
     different values (that would be "perfect" hashing), only that
     non-distinct objects must produce the same values!  For instance,
     a hash function that returns 0 for any given object is a
     perfectly valid (albeit extremely bad) hash function.  A hash
     function that hashes a string by adding up all its characters is
     another example of a valid (but still quite bad) hash function.

     It is not hard to make hash and test functions agree about
     equality.  For example, if the test function compares strings
     case-insensitively, the hash function can lower-case the
     characters when calculating the hash value.  That ensures that
     two strings differing only in case will hash the same.

   - To prevent performance degradation, choose a hash function with
     as good "spreading" as possible.  A good hash function will use
     all the bits of the input when calculating the hash, and will
