/* This file implements "portable timers" (ptimers), objects that
   measure elapsed time using the primitives most appropriate for the
   underlying operating system.  The entry points are:

     ptimer_new     -- creates a timer.
     ptimer_reset   -- resets the timer's elapsed time to zero.
     ptimer_measure -- measure and return the time elapsed since
                       creation or last reset.
     ptimer_read    -- reads the last measured elapsed value.
     ptimer_destroy -- destroy the timer.
     ptimer_granularity -- returns the approximate granularity of the timers.

   Timers measure time in seconds, returning the timings as floating
   point numbers, so they can carry as much precision as the
   underlying system timer supports.  For example, to measure the time
   it takes to run a loop, you can use something like:

     ptimer *tmr = ptimer_new ();
     while (...)
       ... loop ...
     double secs = ptimer_measure ();
     printf ("The loop took %.2fs\n", secs);  */
