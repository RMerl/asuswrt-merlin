dnl Inspired by
dnl https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/blob/master/testcases/open_posix_testsuite/conformance/interfaces/pthread_rwlock_rdlock/2-2.c
dnl by Intel Corporation.

dnl Test whether in a situation where
dnl   - an rwlock is taken by a reader and has a writer waiting,
dnl   - an additional reader requests the lock,
dnl   - the waiting writer and the requesting reader threads have the same
dnl     priority,
dnl the requesting reader thread gets blocked, so that at some point the
dnl waiting writer can acquire the lock.
dnl Without such a guarantee, when there a N readers and each of the readers
dnl spends more than 1/Nth of the time with the lock held, there is a high
dnl probability that the waiting writer will not get the lock in a given finite
dnl time, a phenomenon called "writer starvation".
dnl Without such a guarantee, applications have a hard time avoiding writer
dnl starvation.
dnl
dnl POSIX:2008 makes this requirement only for implementations that support TPS
dnl (Thread Priority Scheduling) and only for the scheduling policies SCHED_FIFO
dnl and SCHED_RR, see
dnl http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_rdlock.html
dnl but test verifies the guarantee regardless of TPS and regardless of
dnl scheduling policy.
