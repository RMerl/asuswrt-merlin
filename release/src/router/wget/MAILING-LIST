Mailing Lists
=============

Primary List
------------

The primary mailinglist for discussion, bug-reports, or questions about
GNU Wget is at <bug-wget@gnu.org>. To subscribe, send an email to
<bug-wget-join@gnu.org>, or visit
`http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget'.

   You do not need to subscribe to send a message to the list; however,
please note that unsubscribed messages are moderated, and may take a
while before they hit the list--*usually around a day*.  If you want
your message to show up immediately, please subscribe to the list
before posting. Archives for the list may be found at
`http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-wget/'.

   An NNTP/Usenettish gateway is also available via Gmane
(http://gmane.org/about.php). You can see the Gmane archives at
`http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.general'. Note that the
Gmane archives conveniently include messages from both the current
list, and the previous one. Messages also show up in the Gmane archives
sooner than they do at `lists.gnu.org'.

Obsolete Lists
--------------

Previously, the mailing list <wget@sunsite.dk> was used as the main
discussion list, and another list, <wget-patches@sunsite.dk> was used
for submitting and discussing patches to GNU Wget.

   Messages from <wget@sunsite.dk> are archived at
     `http://www.mail-archive.com/wget%40sunsite.dk/' and at

     `http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.general' (which also
     continues to archive the current list, <bug-wget@gnu.org>).

   Messages from <wget-patches@sunsite.dk> are archived at
     `http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.patches'.
