   Instead it simply concatenates the arguments, separated by ' ', and calls
   CreateProcess().  We must quote the arguments since Windows CreateProcess()
   interprets characters like ' ', '\t', '\\', '"' (but not '<' and '>') in a
   special way:
   - Space and tab are interpreted as delimiters. They are not treated as
     delimiters if they are surrounded by double quotes: "...".
   - Unescaped double quotes are removed from the input. Their only effect is
     that within double quotes, space and tab are treated like normal
     characters.
   - Backslashes not followed by double quotes are not special.
   - But 2*n+1 backslashes followed by a double quote become
     n backslashes followed by a double quote (n >= 0):
       \" -> "
       \\\" -> \"
       \\\\\" -> \\"
   - '*', '?' characters may get expanded through wildcard expansion in the
     callee: By default, in the callee, the initialization code before main()
     takes the result of GetCommandLine(), wildcard-expands it, and passes it
     to main(). The exceptions to this rule are:
       - programs that inspect GetCommandLine() and ignore argv,
       - mingw programs that have a global variable 'int _CRT_glob = 0;',
       - Cygwin programs, when invoked from a Cygwin program.
