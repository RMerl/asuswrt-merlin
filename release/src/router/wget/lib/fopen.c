  /* If the filename ends in a slash and a mode that requires write access is
     specified, then fail.
     Rationale: POSIX <http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html>
     says that
       "A pathname that contains at least one non-slash character and that
        ends with one or more trailing slashes shall be resolved as if a
        single dot character ( '.' ) were appended to the pathname."
     and
       "The special filename dot shall refer to the directory specified by
        its predecessor."
     If the named file already exists as a directory, then if a mode that
     requires write access is specified, fopen() must fail because POSIX
     <http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/functions/fopen.html> says that it
     fails with errno = EISDIR in this case.
     If the named file does not exist or does not name a directory, then
     fopen() must fail since the file does not contain a '.' directory.  */
