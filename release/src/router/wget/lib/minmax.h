   MIN, MAX macro redefinitions on some systems; the workaround is to
   #include this file as the last one among the #include list.  */

   one of the headers (because the definitions most likely are the same).  */

/* Note: MIN and MAX should be used with two arguments of the
   same type.  They might not return the minimum and maximum of their two
   arguments, if the arguments have different types or have unusual
   floating-point values.  For example, on a typical host with 32-bit 'int',
   64-bit 'long long', and 64-bit IEEE 754 'double' types:

     MAX (-1, 2147483648) returns 4294967295.
     MAX (9007199254740992.0, 9007199254740993) returns 9007199254740992.0.
     MAX (NaN, 0.0) returns 0.0.
     MAX (+0.0, -0.0) returns -0.0.

   and in each case the answer is in some sense bogus.  */
