                         We can get here in four situations:
                           1. When the pipe buffer is full.
                           2. When count <= pipe_buf_size and the number of
                              free bytes in the pipe buffer is < count.
                           3. When count > pipe_buf_size and the number of free
                              bytes in the pipe buffer is > 0, < pipe_buf_size.
                           4. When count > pipe_buf_size and the pipe buffer is
                              entirely empty.
                         The cases 1 and 2 are POSIX compliant.  In cases 3 and
                         4 POSIX specifies that write() must split the request
                         and succeed with a partial write.  We fix case 4.
                         We don't fix case 3 because it is not essential for
                         programs.  */
