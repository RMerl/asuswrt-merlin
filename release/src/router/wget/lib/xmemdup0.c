/* Clone an arbitrary block of bytes P of size S, with error checking,
   and include a terminating NUL byte.  P is of type 'void const *',
   to make it easier to use this with other mem* functions that return
   'void *', but since appending a NUL byte only makes sense on bytes,
   the return type is 'char *'.

   The terminating NUL makes it safe to use strlen or rawmemchr to
   check for embedded NUL; it also speeds up algorithms such as escape
   sequence processing on arbitrary memory, by making it always safe
   to read the byte after the escape character rather than having to
   check if each escape character is the last byte in the object.  */
