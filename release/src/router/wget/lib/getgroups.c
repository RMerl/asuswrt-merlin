   normally defined, since it means "conform to POSIX, but add
   non-POSIX extensions even if that violates the POSIX namespace
   rules", which is what we normally want.  But with getgroups there
   is an inconsistency, and _DARWIN_C_SOURCE means "change getgroups()
   so that it no longer works right".  The BUGS section of compat(5)
   says that the behavior is dubious if you compile different sections
   of a program with different _DARWIN_C_SOURCE settings, so fix only
