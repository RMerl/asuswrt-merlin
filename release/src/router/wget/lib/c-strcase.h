/* The functions defined in this file assume the "C" locale and a character
   set without diacritics (ASCII-US or EBCDIC-US or something like that).
   Even if the "C" locale on a particular system is an extension of the ASCII
   character set (like on BeOS, where it is UTF-8, or on AmigaOS, where it
   is ISO-8859-1), the functions in this file recognize only the ASCII

   string; the other one can also contain non-ASCII characters (but then
   the comparison result will be nonzero).  */
