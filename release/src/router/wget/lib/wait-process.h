/* Wait for a subprocess to finish.  Return its exit code.
   If it didn't terminate correctly, exit if exit_on_error is true, otherwise
   return 127.
   Arguments:
   - child is the pid of the subprocess.
   - progname is the name of the program executed by the subprocess, used for
     error messages.
   - If ignore_sigpipe is true, consider a subprocess termination due to
     SIGPIPE as equivalent to a success.  This is suitable for processes whose
     only purpose is to write to standard output.  This flag can be safely set
     to false when the process' standard output is known to go to DEV_NULL.
   - If null_stderr is true, the usual error message to stderr will be omitted.
     This is suitable when the subprocess does not fulfill an important task.
   - slave_process should be set to true if the process has been launched as a
     slave process.
   - If exit_on_error is true, any error will cause the main process to exit
     with an error status.
   - If termsigp is not NULL: *termsig will be set to the signal that
     terminated the subprocess (if supported by the platform: not on native
     Windows platforms), otherwise 0, and the error message about the signal
     that terminated the subprocess will be omitted.
   Prerequisites: The signal handler for SIGCHLD should not be set to SIG_IGN,
   otherwise this function will not work.  */
