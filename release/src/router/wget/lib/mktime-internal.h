/* mktime_offset_t is a signed type wide enough to hold a UTC offset
   in seconds, and used as part of the type of the offset-guess
   argument to mktime_internal.  Use time_t on platforms where time_t
   is signed, to be compatible with platforms like BeOS that export
   this implementation detail of mktime.  On platforms where time_t is
   unsigned, GNU and POSIX code can assume 'int' is at least 32 bits
   which is wide enough for a UTC offset.  */
