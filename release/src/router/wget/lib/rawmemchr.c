  /* Instead of the traditional loop which tests each byte, we will
     test a longword at a time.  The tricky part is testing if *any of
     the four* bytes in the longword in question are equal to NUL or
     c.  We first use an xor with repeated_c.  This reduces the task
     to testing whether *any of the four* bytes in longword1 is zero.

     We compute tmp =
       ((longword1 - repeated_one) & ~longword1) & (repeated_one << 7).
     That is, we perform the following operations:
       1. Subtract repeated_one.
       2. & ~longword1.
       3. & a mask consisting of 0x80 in every byte.
     Consider what happens in each byte:
       - If a byte of longword1 is zero, step 1 and 2 transform it into 0xff,
         and step 3 transforms it into 0x80.  A carry can also be propagated
         to more significant bytes.
       - If a byte of longword1 is nonzero, let its lowest 1 bit be at
         position k (0 <= k <= 7); so the lowest k bits are 0.  After step 1,
         the byte ends in a single bit of value 0 and k bits of value 1.
         After step 2, the result is just k bits of value 1: 2^k - 1.  After
         step 3, the result is 0.  And no carry is produced.
     So, if longword1 has only non-zero bytes, tmp is zero.
     Whereas if longword1 has a zero byte, call j the position of the least
     significant zero byte.  Then the result has a zero at positions 0, ...,
     j-1 and a 0x80 at position j.  We cannot predict the result at the more
     significant bytes (positions j+1..3), but it does not matter since we
     already have a non-zero bit at position 8*j+7.

     The test whether any byte in longword1 is zero is equivalent
     to testing whether tmp is nonzero.

     This test can read beyond the end of a string, depending on where
     C_IN is encountered.  However, this is considered safe since the
     initialization phase ensured that the read will be aligned,
     therefore, the read will not cross page boundaries and will not
     cause a fault.  */
