Building comgt
=============
Switch to the directory where files from comgt.xxxx.tgz were unpacked. Run:

	make all

You can run comgt immediately if your datacard is plugged in and you have the appropriate permissions to access the device.

To install comgt, sigmon and their documentation, become root,
make sure you're in the directory where comgt was compiled and run:

	make install

This will install comgt and sigmon in /usr/local/bin and their manpages 
in /usr/local/man/man1. If this doesn't match your installation or you 
want to install the executables and manpages somewhere else, simply 
edit the EXE and MAN macro definitions on lines 3 and 4 of Makefile.

To remove the executables and manpages, become root, make sure you're 
in the directory where comgt was compiled and run:

	make uninstall

To tidy to after installing comgt, make sure you're logged in as the
user who compiled comgt and in the directory where comgt was compiled.
Then run:

	make clean

The example scripts included in the distribution are left in the
build directory.
