--- Installation --- 

Load the Tuxera NTFS kernel module, called tntfs.ko, into the kernel: 

	insmod tntfs.ko

then the Tuxera NTFS kernel driver is ready to be used.


--- Usage ---

Mount NTFS volumes the following way:

	mount -t tntfs [-o options] device mountpoint

The Tuxera NTFS kernel driver can work in two main performance modes:

1. Normal mount mode: the kernel driver is doing transparent caching. 
   This can significantly improve most different kind of workloads. 

2. 'iostreaming' mount mode: besides transparent caching, this mode gives 
   the highest possible read and write throughput performance and at the 
   same time it has the lowest CPU usage. 

Examples:

  mount -t tntfs device mountpoint
  mount -t tntfs -o iostreaming device mountpoint 


--- Mount Options ---

In addition to the generic mount options described by the manual page 
for the mount(8) command (e.g. ro, rw, sync, noatime, etc, please see 
'man 8 mount' and  'man 5 fstab' for details), the Tuxera NTFS driver 
supports the following mount options:

  uid=, gid=, umask=

They provide default owner, group, and access mode mask. These options work
as documented in mount(8). By default, the files and directories are owned
by root and everybody has read and write permissions, as well as browse
permission for directories. I.e. the mode on all files and directories is
by default rwxrwxrwx, a consequence of the default umask=0000.

  fmask=, dmask=

Instead of specifying umask= which applies both to files and directories,
fmask applies only to files and dmask only to directories.

  nls=name

Character set to use when returning file names. Note that most character
sets contain insufficient characters to represent all possible Unicode
characters that can exist on NTFS. To be sure you are not missing any
files, you are advised to use nls=utf8 which is capable of representing all
Unicode characters.

  utf8

Use full Unicode support thus interpreting the NTFS characters to be stored
in utf16 rather than UCS2 and assuming that the Linux side is using utf8.

  iocharset=name

Deprecated option. Still supported but please use utf8 or nls=name in the
future.

  show_sys_files

If show_sys_files is specified, show the system files in directory
listings. Otherwise the default behavior is to hide the system files. Note
that even when show_sys_files is specified, "$MFT" will not be visible due
to some libc implementations. Further, note that irrespective of
show_sys_files, all files are accessible by name, i.e. you can always do
"ls -l \$UpCase" for example to specifically show the system file
containing the Unicode upcase table.

  case_sensitive=<BOOL>

If case_sensitive is specified, treat all file names as case sensitive and
create file names in the POSIX namespace. The default behavior is to treat
file names as case insensitive.

  disable_sparse

If disable_sparse is specified, creation of sparse regions, i.e. holes,
inside files is disabled for the volume (for the duration of mount only).
By default, creation of sparse regions is enabled, which is consistent with
the behavior of traditional Unix filesystems.

  errors=opt

What to do when critical filesystem errors are found. Following values can
be used for "opt":

continue: DEFAULT, try to clean-up as much as possible, e.g. marking a corrupt inode
as bad so it is no longer accessed, and then continue.

recover: recovery as much as possible and continue operation. If
read-only mount, the recovery is done in memory only and not written to
disk.

  ioblocksize=SIZE

The preferred/optimal default I/O block size which the driver advertises
to user space via the stat, fstat and lstat system calls. The default I/O
block size is 131072 (128 kB).

  iostreaming

The iostreaming mount mode gives the highest possible read and write
throughput performance and at the same time it has the lowest CPU usage
during large file transfers.

  min_iostreaming_read_iosize=SIZE, min_iostreaming_write_iosize=SIZE

The minimum block size when iostreaming starts is configurable for both
read and write via theses mount options. Optimal values are are chipset
and deployment specific, typically between 64kB and 1 MB. Defaults are
64 kB for write and 128 kB for read.

  sloppy

If sloppy is specified, ignore unknown mount options. Otherwise the default
behavior is to abort mount if any unknown options are found.


--- Utilities ---

The software package may include additional utilities like:

 - mkntfs: speed optimized, low memory footprint, NTFS volume size 
   independent NTFS 'format' utility.

 - ntfsck: check and repair NTFS.

 - ntfslabel: show or change the label on an NTFS file system.
 
 - ntfsinfo: show information about the volume, files, inodes, attributes.

 - ntfsdebug: collect NTFS metadata for debug, analyses, troubleshooting 
   purposes.

Please see their usage in the relevant utility manual page, and/or type
'utility_name --help' for a brief introduction.

Tuxera developed and supports many additional NTFS related utilities, 
used by millions of installation which may be useful for your usage 
scenario. These include but not limited to backup, restore, defragment, 
resize, compare, undelete, copy, list, wipe, dump. Please let us know.


--- Benchmarking and Tuning ---

A benchmark utility, called tuxera.bench, is included in the package.
Tuxera.bench is a high-performance benchmark, similar to 'iozone'. The
major difference is that while 'iozone' can run for hours, tuxera.bench 
can get the same or very similar results in a few minutes.

Tuxera.bench is able to determine the cached and effective read and
write speeds using different record/block sizes in a very short time.
The benchmark tool can be used to find the optimal I/O buffer size and
alignment giving the highest throughput on a platform to tune the
performance critical applications.

Please see 'tuxera.bench --help' for the options. Typically the default 
buffer alignment, shown by the previous command, gives the best performance.

Usage: 'cd' into a file system mounted by a file system driver to be tested
then issue the following command

	path/to/tuxera.bench 

Benchmark the following cases:

  1. Tuxera NTFS kernel driver in normal mount mode
  2. Tuxera NTFS kernel driver in 'iostreaming' mount mode
  3. Other Linux file system, e.g. ext2, ext3, ext4, XFS, FAT32

Please make sure the tests are done using the same disk and the same partition 
with the different file systems, otherwise the comparison can be misleading.

Please also note that lower capacity flash devices (USB pen drives, SD, MMC, 
CF, etc cards) can have a significantly lower speed limit than the maximum 
speed achievable by the file system drivers.

Explanation of the outputs:

'Cached Write Performance' means the performance what applications
and users experience if lots of free RAM is available but no guarantee 
that the data is on the disk.

'Effective Write Performance' means that the written data is on the disk.
This is more relevant for sustained write (large amount of data).

'Cached Read Performance' typically shows the memory bandwidth. Caching 
read data can greatly help small reads and short-term rereads.

'Effective Read Performance' means non-cached read performance from the 
disk via the file system.

'Device Read Performance' means non-cached read performance from the 
disk without file system involvement. This is the physical performance 
limit of the hardware, firmwares and kernel device drivers. Effective
file system read performance is rarely higher than this values.
