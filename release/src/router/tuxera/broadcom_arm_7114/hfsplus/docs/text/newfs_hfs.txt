NAME
       newfs_hfs - create a HFS+ file system

SYNOPSIS
       newfs_hfs [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       newfs_hfs  is used to create an HFS+ file system on a device (usually a
       disk or flash partition) or image.  device is the special  file  corre‐
       sponding  to  the  device (e.g.  /dev/sdXX, /dev/block/mmcblk1p1) or an
       image file.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that newfs_hfs accepts.

       -s,    Creates a case-sensitive HFS+ file-system. By  default  a  case-
              insensitive file-system is created.

       -w     Adds an HFS wrapper around the HFS+ file system.

       -U UID Set owner of the file-system root directory.

       -G GID Set group of the file-system root directory.

       -M MASK
              Set permission mask for the file-system root directory.

       -b SIZE
              Set  the  allocation  block size (in bytes) to SIZE. The default
              value is 4096.

       -v VOLUME-NAME
              Volume name in ASCII or UTF-8 format.

       -i FIRST-CNID
              Sets the first catalog node ID for user files  and  directories.
              The default value is 16.

       -N PARTITION-SIZE
              Print  summary of file-system parameters without actually creat‐
              ing the file- system. This might be  useful  for  verifying  the
              actual parameters before creating the file-system.

       -J JOURNAL-SIZE
              Creates  a  journaled  HFS+  volume. The default journal size is
              8MB.

       -c CLUMP-SIZE-LIST
              Sets the clump and/or initial sizes, in allocation  blocks,  for
              meta-data  files.  It  is  specified  with -c option followed by
              comma seperated list of the form args=value.

              Set the attribute file clump size.  Set  the  allocation  bitmap
              file  clump  size.   Set  the  catalog file clump size.  Set the
              extent overflow file clump size.


       -n NODE-SIZE-LIST
              Sets  b-tree node sizes, in bytes, for the various b-tree files.
              It is specified with the -n option followed by a comma separated
              list of the form arg=value.  Node size must be a  power  of  two
              and  no  larger than 32768 bytes.  Set the attribute b-tree node
              size.  Set the catalog b-tree node size.  Set the  extent  over‐
              flow b-tree node size.
