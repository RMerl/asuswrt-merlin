EXFATLABEL(8)                                                    EXFATLABEL(8)



NAME
       exfatlabel - display/change the label on an exFAT file system

SYNOPSIS
       exfatlabel [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       exfatlabel  will  display  or change the file system label on the exFAT
       file system located on device.

       If none of the -l or the -d options are specified, the  current  volume
       label  will  be printed to standard output and no modifications will be
       made.

       It is also possible to set the file system label using the -l option of
       mkexfat(8) during creation of the file system.

OPTIONS
       Below  is a summary of all the options that exfatlabel accepts.  Nearly
       all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by -
       and the long name is preceded by --.

       -l, --label LABEL
              Set  the  volume  label  of an exFAT volume to LABEL. The volume
              label is limited to 11 UTF-16 units, i.e. 11 characters in  most
              cases. This option and the -d option are mutually exclusive.

       -d, --delete
              Deletes  the  volume  label  that is currently set for the exFAT
              volume. Changing the volume label to an empty string is  similar
              to  deleting  it, but on a lower level the former means that the
              volume label entry in the root directory is still present  while
              after  a delete it is completely removed. This option and the -l
              option are mutually exclusive.
