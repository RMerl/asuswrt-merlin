NAME
       exfatinfo - dump a file's attributes

SYNOPSIS
       exfatinfo [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       exfatinfo  will  dump  the attributes of inode inode-number or the file
       path-filename.  Run exfatinfo without arguments  for  a  full  list  of
       options.

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a summary of all the options that exfatinfo accepts.  Nearly
       all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by -
       and  the  long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that
       don't take an argument, can be combined into  a  single  command,  e.g.
       -fv  is  equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to
       any unique prefix of their name.

       -c, --case-sensitive
              Use case-sensitive lookup (the default is to ignore case).

       -p, --path PATH
              Show information about the path or  directory  denoted  by  PATH
              (must be a POSIX-style absolute path, i.e. starting with a '/').
