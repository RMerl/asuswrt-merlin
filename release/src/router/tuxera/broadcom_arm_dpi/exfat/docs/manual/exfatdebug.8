.TH EXFATDEBUG 8 "October 2012" "Tuxera exFAT 3013.11.8"
.SH NAME
exfatdebug \- Create a metadata dump of an exFAT volume suitable for bug
reporting.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exfatdebug
\fIdevice|image\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B exfatdebug
will efficiently extract all metadata relevant for debugging from an exFAT
volume and dump it to standard output.
It works at disk sector level and copies only the metadata of the exFAT volume
(so the resulting output is relatively small).

.B exfatdebug
is mostly useful when sending bug reports to exFAT developers.
.SH EXIT CODES
The exit code is 0 on success, non\-zero otherwise.
.SH EXAMPLES
Dump exFAT file system metadata on /dev/sda1 to a local image file:
.RS
.sp
.B exfatdebug /dev/sda1 > sda1.img
.sp
.RE

.RE
Dump exFAT file system metadata to a remote host, using ssh. Please note that
