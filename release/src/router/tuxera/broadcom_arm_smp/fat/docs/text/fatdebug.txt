FATDEBUG(8)                                                        FATDEBUG(8)



NAME
       fatdebug  -  Create  a  metadata dump of an FAT volume suitable for bug
       reporting.

SYNOPSIS
       fatdebug device|image

DESCRIPTION
       fatdebug will efficiently extract all metadata relevant  for  debugging
       from  an  FAT  volume and dump it to standard output.  It works at disk
       sector level and copies only the metadata of the  FAT  volume  (so  the
       resulting output is relatively small).

       fatdebug is mostly useful when sending bug reports to FAT developers.

EXIT CODES
       The exit code is 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.

EXAMPLES
       Dump FAT file system metadata on /dev/sda1 to a local image file:

              fatdebug /dev/sda1 > sda1.img

       Dump  FAT file system metadata on /dev/sda1 to a bzip2-compressed local
       image file:

              fatdebug /dev/sda1 | bzip2 > sda1.img

       Dump FAT file system metadata to a remote host, using ssh. Please  note
       that ssh may ask for a password!

              fatdebug /dev/sda1 | ssh host 'cat > sda1.img'
