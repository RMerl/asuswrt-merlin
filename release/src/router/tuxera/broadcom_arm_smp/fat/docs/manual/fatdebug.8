.TH FATDEBUG 8 "June 2013" "Tuxera TFATprogs 3013.7.17"
.SH NAME
fatdebug \- Create a metadata dump of an FAT volume suitable for bug
reporting.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fatdebug
\fIdevice|image\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fatdebug
will efficiently extract all metadata relevant for debugging from an FAT
volume and dump it to standard output.
It works at disk sector level and copies only the metadata of the FAT volume
(so the resulting output is relatively small).

.B fatdebug
is mostly useful when sending bug reports to FAT developers.
.SH EXIT CODES
The exit code is 0 on success, non\-zero otherwise.
.SH EXAMPLES
Dump FAT file system metadata on /dev/sda1 to a local image file:
.RS
.sp
.B fatdebug /dev/sda1 > sda1.img
.sp
