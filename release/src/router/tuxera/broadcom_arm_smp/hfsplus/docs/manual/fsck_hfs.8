.SH NAME
fsck_hfs \- check and repair an HFS+ volume
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsck_hfs
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fsck_hfs
will check an HFS+ volume for errors, and optionally correct them.
Run fsck_hfs without arguments for a full list of options.
.SH OPTIONS
Below is a summary of all the options that
.B fsck_hfs
accepts.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Do only a quick test to check if the file-system will mount properly. This
is useful when you want to do a fast check to find out if the volume was 
unmounted cleanly. It returns a non non-zero exit value if the volume was not
unmounted cleanly, otherwise an exit value of 0 is returned.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Verbose output. This is useful for debugging when \fBfsck_hfs\fR cannot repair 
a corrupted HFS+ volume.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Force \fBfsck_hfs\fR to check and repair journaled HFS+ file-system. When used
with \fB\-p\fR option, forces \fBfsck_hfs\fR to check 'clean' file systems.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Lock the file-system and perform a read-only check. This is useful when you want
to check a mounted volume, without trying to repair it.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR  MODE
Set permissions for the lost+found directory when created. It accepts an octal
value that will be used to set the permission. \fBfsck_hfs\fR places orphaned
files and directories in lost+found directory (located in the root directory).
Default mode is 01777.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Preen the specified file-system.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR  SIZE
Specify the internal cache size used by \fBfsck_hfs\fR. Bigger size can ensure
better performance but can deadlock when used with \fB\-l\fR option. It accepts
size value as an argument, which can be a decimal, octal, or a hexadecimal
number. Numbers ending with a 'k', 'm' or 'g' are multiplied by 1024 (1K),
1048576 (1M) or 1073741824 (1G), respectively.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Rebuild the catalog file on the specified file-system.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR
Always try to repair every corruption that is found.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Never try to repair any corruption that is found.

.SH EXIT STATUS
\fB0\fR: Success quick test, file-system was cleanly unmounted.
.TP
\fB3\fR: File-system Dirty, no checks.
.TP
\fB4\fR: Writeable Root File-system was fixed.
.TP
\fB8\fR: Standard error exit.
