NAME
       fsck_hfs - check and repair an HFS+ volume

SYNOPSIS
       fsck_hfs [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       fsck_hfs  will  check an HFS+ volume for errors, and optionally correct
       them.  Run fsck_hfs without arguments for a full list of options.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that fsck_hfs accepts.

       -q     Do only a quick test to check  if  the  file-system  will  mount
              properly.  This  is  useful  when you want to do a fast check to
              find out if the volume was unmounted cleanly. It returns  a  non
              non-zero  exit  value  if  the volume was not unmounted cleanly,
              otherwise an exit value of 0 is returned.

       -d     Verbose output. This is useful for debugging when fsck_hfs  can‐
              not repair a corrupted HFS+ volume.

       -f     Force  fsck_hfs  to check and repair journaled HFS+ file-system.
              When used with -p option, forces fsck_hfs to check 'clean'  file
              systems.

       -l     Lock the file-system and perform a read-only check. This is use‐
              ful when you want to check a mounted volume, without  trying  to
              repair it.

       -m  MODE
              Set  permissions  for  the lost+found directory when created. It
              accepts an octal value that will be used to set the  permission.
              fsck_hfs  places  orphaned  files  and directories in lost+found
              directory (located in the  root  directory).   Default  mode  is
              01777.

       -p     Preen the specified file-system.

       -c  SIZE
              Specify  the  internal  cache size used by fsck_hfs. Bigger size
              can ensure better performance but can deadlock when used with -l
              option.  It  accepts  size  value as an argument, which can be a
              decimal, octal, or a hexadecimal number. Numbers ending  with  a
              'k',  'm'  or  'g'  are multiplied by 1024 (1K), 1048576 (1M) or
              1073741824 (1G), respectively.

       -r     Rebuild the catalog file on the specified file-system.

       -y     Always try to repair every corruption that is found.

       -n     Never try to repair any corruption that is found.


EXIT STATUS
       0: Success quick test, file-system was cleanly unmounted.

       3: File-system Dirty, no checks.

       4: Writeable Root File-system was fixed.

       8: Standard error exit.
