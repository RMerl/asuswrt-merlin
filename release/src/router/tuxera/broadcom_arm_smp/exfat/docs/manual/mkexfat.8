.SH NAME
mkexfat \- create an exFAT file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkexfat
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkexfat
is used to create an exFAT file system on a device (usually a disk or flash
partition) or image.
.I device
is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g.
.IR /dev/sdXX, 
.IR /dev/block/mmcblk1p1 )
or an image file.
.SH OPTIONS
Below is a summary of all the options that
.B mkexfat
accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
preceded by
.B \-
and the long name is preceded by
.BR \-\- .
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alignment\fR ALIGNMENT
The alignment of the different exFAT regions, specified in bytes. For instance
if a certain type of flash memory might perform best if the internal structures
are aligned to 4 MiB boundaries, alignment should be specified as 4194304.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cluster\-size\fR SIZE
Set the cluster size (in bytes) of the volume to \fBSIZE\fR. The default is to
determine optimal cluster size automatically.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Allow formatting an exFAT volume for which the physical sector size cannot be
automatically detected (for example an image file).
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-guid\fR GUID
Set the volume GUID of the volume to \fBGUID\fR (the default is to not set any
volume GUID).
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-volume\-label\fR STRING
Set the volume label for the filesystem. The volume label can be up to 11
UTF\-16 units long, i.e. in most cases 11 characters.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sector\-size\fR SIZE
Set the volume sector size (in bytes) to \fBSIZE\fR. The default is to
detect sector size automatically. Note: This option should probably never be
used when formatting devices directly as most exFAT drivers won't be able to use
an exFAT volume where the volume sector size doesn't match the physical sector
size (though exFAT/U can in fact do this).
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Makes
.B mkexfat
emit certain status messages related to the formatting process.
.TP
\fB\-\-sda\-strict\fR
Forces the formatted volume to adhere to SD Association recommendations.
.TP
\fB\-\-sda\-whole\fR
Performs a whole device formatting, including partition table, according to the
SD Association recommendations. This option should only be used with whole
devices (e.g. \fI/dev/mmcblk0\fR) and never partitions (e.g. \fI/dev/mmcblk0p1\fR).
.TP
\fB\-\-sda\-relax\fR
Relaxes sanity checks for \fB\-\-sda\-strict\fR and \fB\-\-sda\-whole\fR to
allow formatting devices that don't comply to the size specifications of SD
cards to be formatted according to the SD Association guidelines.

NOTE: This option is only a modifier to \fB\-\-sda\-strict\fR and
\fB\-\-sda\-whole\fR and does not do anything on its own.
.TP
\fB\-\-discard\fR
This option sends a 'discard' command, like TRIM, to the device
which will zero all data on it.
