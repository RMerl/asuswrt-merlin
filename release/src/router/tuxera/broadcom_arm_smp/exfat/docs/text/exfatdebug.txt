NAME
       exfatdebug - Create a metadata dump of an exFAT volume suitable for bug
       reporting.

SYNOPSIS
       exfatdebug device|image

DESCRIPTION
       exfatdebug will efficiently extract all metadata relevant for debugging
       from  an exFAT volume and dump it to standard output.  It works at disk
       sector level and copies only the metadata of the exFAT volume  (so  the
       resulting output is relatively small).

       exfatdebug  is mostly useful when sending bug reports to exFAT develop‐
       ers.

EXIT CODES
       The exit code is 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.

EXAMPLES
       Dump exFAT file system metadata on /dev/sda1 to a local image file:

              exfatdebug /dev/sda1 > sda1.img

       Dump exFAT file system metadata  on  /dev/sda1  to  a  bzip2-compressed
       local image file:

              exfatdebug /dev/sda1 | bzip2 > sda1.img

       Dump  exFAT  file  system  metadata to a remote host, using ssh. Please
       note that ssh may ask for a password!

              exfatdebug /dev/sda1 | ssh host 'cat > sda1.img'
