Welcome to the README File.
This will explain the email program as well as it can.  
First thing is first.  This file will take place as sort of a 
FAQ sheet, because I already know what questions will be asked.
So read along.

Q: What is 'email' ?

A:  'email' is a program I designed that will send email via the command line
    to remote smtp servers or use 'sendmail' internally, and fully interact with
    GNUPG to encrypt and sign your e-mails, so you decide to do so...
    You can get GNUPG at: http://www.gnupg.org

Q: How do I checkout the latest source so I can help?

A: eMail is now hosted on github. Make sure you get both the eMail source and
   dlib source and put the dlib source inside of the email source.  For example:

     git clone git@github.com:deanproxy/eMail.git
     cd eMail
     git clone git@github.com:deanproxy/dlib.git

Q: How do I compile and Install this thing?

A: Just do this:
    
    ./configure
    make
    make install # as root

Q: Where is it installed?

A:  the executable is called 'email' and is installed in a directory that
    is under the prefix or bindir specified during the ./configure of email.  
    If you choose to specify a prefix during configure, it will go under $bindir
    Which, by default, is an offset of $prefix/bin.  If you specify --bindir
    then the binary will be put in $bindir.

    If you do not specify a directory prefix during configure, then it will 
    go under /usr/local/bin/email.  The configuration files are installed by
    default in /usr/local/etc/email.  However, if you specify the --sysconfdir
    option during ./configure, then the configuration files will go in $sysconfdir.
    
    Please view ./configure --help

Q: How do I make your freakin' program work?

A:  Well, first thing you should do, is configure this email client.
    You will have the configuration file in /usr/local/etc/email/email.conf
    Some less important options are not set (address_book, save_sent_mail, 
    temp_dir reply_to, signature_file, signature_divide) but you can easily set 
    these by hand and they are not needed to properly run email.

    You will see it has a few options you must set to your environment.

    1: SMTP_SERVER:	       Please specify your smtp server name, or IP address here
    2: SMTP_PORT:    	   Please specify your smtp servers port number for use
    3: MY_NAME       	   Please specify your Name here
    4: MY_EMAIL:     	   Please specify your email address here
    5: REPLY_TO:     	   Specify a seperate reply to address here
    6: SIGNATURE_FILE:	   Specify your signature file
    7: ADDRESS_BOOK:	   Where to find your address book file
    8: SAVE_SENT_MAIL:     What directory to save the email.sent file to
    9: TEMP_DIR:           Specify where to store temporary files
   10: GPG_BIN:            Specify where the gpg binary is located.
   11: GPG_PASS:           Optional passphrase for gpg.
   12: SMTP_AUTH:          LOGIN or PLAIN are supported SMTP AUTH types
   13: SMTP_AUTH_USER:     Your SMTP AUTH username
   14: SMTP_AUTH_PASS:     Your SMTP AUTH Password
   15: USE_TLS             Boolean (true/false) to use TLS/SSL
   16: VCARD               Specify a vcard to attach to each message

    SMTP_SERVER can be either a remote SMTP servers fully qualified domain name, or
    an IP address.  You may also opt to use 'sendmail' internally instead of sending
    via remote SMTP servers.  To do this you just put the path to the sendmail
    binary and any options you would like to use with sendmail (Use -t) in the place
    of the smtp server name... HINT: If you would like to send emails to people on
    your local box (i.e. djones@localhost ), then you must use the sendmail binary.


    When you are specifying file paths, you can use the tilde wildcard as you 
    could in the shell to specify your home directory. Example: ~/.email.conf
    would mean /home/user/.email.conf to the email program.

    Once you are done here, you can leave your email in /usr/local/etc/email/email.conf
    or the directory you specified during the configure with --sysconfdir=...
    for a global configuration, or in your local home directory as ~/.email.conf for
    a personal configuration.  Personal configs override global configs.  

    You can get online help by using the --help option with email and specifying
    the command line option you need help with.  Example: email --help encrypt

    If you use the -encrypt or -sign option, you MUST have GNUPG installed on your system.
    email uses gpg to encrypt the email to the FIRST email recipient

    Example: email -s "This is the subject" -encrypt dean@somedomain.org
    
    in that example, I would be sending the email to dean@somedomain.org and gpg would
    encrypt it with the key of dean@somedomain.org

    You can use -high-priority ( or -o ) to send your message in a high priority
    matter.  In MS Outlook you will see a little '!' mark next to the letter so that
    the recipient will see that the message is high priority!

    You can send a message in one of two ways:
    The first way is to already have a message ready to send.  Say if I have a file named
    "this.txt"  and I want to send it to 'dean@somedomain.org'.  I can redirect this file to
    the email program in one of two ways.  Example below:

    cat this.txt | email -s "Sending this.txt to you" dean@somedomain.org
    or
    email -s "Sending this.txt to you" dean@somedomain.org < this.txt

    If you want to create a message, you will need to do two things here.
    First set the environment variable "EDITOR" to your favorite editor. 

    Example: 'export EDITOR=vi'

    Please use your favorite editor in place of vi.
    Now all you have to do is execute the example below:

    Example: email -s "Subject" dean@somedomain.org

    This will open up your favorite editor and let you write a email to dean@somedomain.org
    email will default to 'vi' if you do not set EDITOR.

    You can send to multiple recipients with 'email'.  All you have to do is
    put commas between the email addresses you want the message to be sent to.
    Example below:
    dean@somedomain.org,another@domain.com,you@domain.com 

    Here are some more examples below:

    Example: the below command will send a message that is encrypted with 'dean@somedomain.org' key
    email -s "my email to you" -encrypt dean@somedomain.org,software@cleancode.org

    Example: the example will sign the message directed to it.
    email -s "signed message" -sign dean@somedomain.org < secret_stuff.txt

    Example: This will send to multiple recipients 
    email -s "To all of you" dean@somedomain.org,you@domain.com,me@cleancode.org 

    Example: Set message to high priority
    email -s "High priority email" -high-priority dean@somedomain.org

    Example: Send message with 2 attachements
    email -s "here you go..." -attach file -attach file2 dean@somedomain.org

    Example: Add headers to the message
    email -s "New Message" --header "X-My-Header: Stuff" \
      --header "X-Another-Header: More Stuff" dean@somedomain.org

Q: Do you allow signatures?

A:  Yes, we do.
    Look in email.conf and edit the signature variables as needed.
    If you're wondering what a signature divider is, it's the little
    thingy that divides your email message from the signature.
    Usually it's '---' (Default)

    Also, you can specify wild cards in the signature file.  
    %c = Formated time, date, timezone ( looks like the output of 'date' )
    %t = Time only ( US Standard format )
    %d = Date Only ( US Standard format )
    %v = Version ( For us folks who want to endorse 'email' )
    %h = Host type (ex. Linux 2.2.19 i686 )
    %f = Prints output from the 'fortune(6)' command
    %% = Prints a % mark

    Your sig could look like this:
    ---
    This message was sent: %c
	
    This would end up looking like: 
	This message was sent: Thu Dec 13 04:54:52 PM EST 2001

Q: How does the address Book work?

A:  Set up your email.conf file to point to your very own address book.
    There is a template in the email source directory that you can view to set up your 
    own address book.  The format should be as below:

	Any single name to email translation will have to have a 'single:' token before it:
	  single: Software    = software ^at^ cleancode.org
	  single: Dean        = dean@somedomain.org
	  single: "Full Name" = someone@somedomain.org

	Any group name to email translation will have to have a 'group:' token before it: 
	With groups, you can only use the Names of your single statements above... Format below:
	  group: Both = Software,Dean

    See the email.address.template file for more information


Q: Do you allow attachments?

A:  YES!  We now support attachments with email!
    Simply specify the files you want attached to your email by specifying the --attach
    option, with a list of files delemited by commas.  All files will be encoded with
    base64 and attached with the appropriate MIME headings.
    
    Example:
    
      email -s Attachment --attach file dean@somedomain.org

      # Multiple files
      email -s Attachments --attach file1 --attach file2 dean@somedomain.org
      

Q: Do you allow SMTP AUTH?

A:  Yes! Email does SMTP AUTH.  You will need to set a few options in the email.conf
    file.  SMTP_AUTH, SMTP_AUTH_USER and SMTP_AUTH_PASS.  If you want to know more
    about this, please view the email manual page 'man email'.


Q: Can I join the development team?

A:  Yes, send an email at http://www.cleancode.org/projects/email and ask how, or just 
    clone it with git (see above on how to do that) and start coding and committing!

Q: Why email?

A:  Because 'mailx' won't send to remote smtp servers and I didn't have access to sendmail.
    I needed something that would communicate with Remote smtp servers and encrypt my messages 
	on the fly instead of taking numerous steps to do so.

Q: What does 'email' stand for?

A:  Well, despite popular belief, it stands for "Encrypted Mail"  Not "Electronic Mail"
    My initial purpose was to make e-mail easier to send via command line and encrypt it
    with out taking all the damn steps 'mailx' makes you take!   Sorry mailx!  

Q: Who are the developers?

A:  Dean Jones - Main developer

Q: Can I contact the developers via IM's?

A:  Yes.  You can contact Dean via AOL IM as intargc

That's about it so far.
