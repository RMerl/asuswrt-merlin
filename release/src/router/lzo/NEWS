============================================================================
User visible changes for LZO -- a real-time data compression library
============================================================================

Changes in 2.08 (29 Jun 2014)
  * Updated the Autoconf scripts to fix some reported build problems.
  * Added CMake build support.
  * Fixed lzo_init() on big-endian architectures like Sparc.

Changes in 2.07 (25 Jun 2014)
  * Fixed a potential integer overflow condition in the "safe" decompressor
    variants which could result in a possible buffer overrun when
    processing maliciously crafted compressed input data.

    Fortunately this issue only affects 32-bit systems and also can only happen
    if you use uncommonly huge buffer sizes where you have to decompress more
    than 16 MiB (> 2^24 bytes) untrusted compressed bytes within a single
    function call, so the practical implications are limited.

    POTENTIAL SECURITY ISSUE. CVE-2014-4607.

  * Removed support for ancient configurations like 16-bit "huge" pointers -
    LZO now requires a flat 32-bit or 64-bit memory model.
  * Assorted cleanups.

Changes in 2.06 (12 Aug 2011)
  * Some minor optimizations for big-endian architectures.
  * Fixed overly strict malloc() misalignment check in examples.

Changes in 2.05 (23 Apr 2011)
  * Converted the configure system to non-recursive Automake.
  * Applied some overdue speed optimizations for modern x86/x64 architectures
    and current compilers like gcc 4.6 and MSVC 2010.

Changes in 2.04 (31 Oct 2010)
  * Fixed a gcc-4.5 aliasing issue in lzo_init().
  * Updated the configure system.
  * Assorted cleanups.

Changes in 2.03 (30 Apr 2008)
  * Updated the ELF assembler sources to mark the stack as non-executable.
  * Fixed a HP-UX 11 build issue with Itanium in ILP32 mode.
  * Updated the configure system.

Changes in 2.02 (17 Oct 2005)
  * Updated the build and Autoconf scripts to fix some reported
    compilation problems.

Changes in 2.01 (27 Jun 2005)
  * Changed the configure system to install the LZO library under the
    name "liblzo2" so that parallel installation with LZO v1 is possible.
  * Improved auto-configuration in miniLZO for some embedded targets like
    Blackfin and H8/300 processors.

Changes in 2.00 (30 May 2005)

  [Library interface changes]
  * The 'lzo_uint' typedef has been changed to match 'size_t', which means
    it now is 64 bits on most 64-bit architectures. 32-bit machines
    are not affected by this change.
  * The formula for maximum expansion of incompressible data has changed.
    See doc/LZO.FAQ. This is needed for some upcoming speed improvements,
    and also for compatibility with our commercial LZO Professional product.
  * The progress indicator callback interface has been revamped.
  * All public header files now get installed into a "lzo" subdirectory, so
    your applications should use #include <lzo/lzoXXX.h>.
  * A number of (internal) macros have been renamed. See LZO_CFG_COMPAT
    in <lzo/lzoconf.h> if your code depends on these.

  [Speed]
  * Small overall speedup by exploiting features like branch prediction
    hints and explicit inline control present in modern C/C++ compilers.
  * Significant speedup for 64-bit architectures like AMD64.

  [Portability]
  * LZO now fully supports the LLP64 programming model.
  * LZO now fully supports the ILP64 and SILP64 programming models which
    are used on some supercomputing architectures.
  * Full Win64 support for AMD64 (aka x64) and IA64 (Itanium).
  * Full 16-bit support for ancient DOS 286 protected mode, OS/2 1.x
    and Windows 3.x.
  * The LZO library now compiles and works on completely freestanding or
    embedded systems as long as you have <limits.h> and <stddef.h> header
    files. See the B/generic/build_freestanding.sh build script.

  [Misc]
  * The i386 assembler versions of the decompressors are now automatically
    built and installed. See also asm/i386/00README.TXT.
  * Added include file <lzo/lzo_asm.h> that provides prototypes for all
    assembler functions.
  * Under MacOS X, the configure script now will use the '-no-cpp-precomp'
    compiler option in order to work around bugs in some versions of
    Apple's native "smart" preprocessor.
  * Worked around a preprocessor bug that is present in all compilers which
    are based on the lcc compiler kit.
  * Added simple B/generic/build.sh build script family.
  * Added lots of new build scripts for various DOS/Windows compilers.

  [Upgrade instructions from LZO v1 to LZO v2]
  * On 64-bit architectures, revisit all uses of lzo_uint.
  * Adapt for the maximum expansion change of incompressible data.
  * If you use the progress callback then adapt for the new interface.
  * Use #include <lzo/lzoXXX.h> or adjust your include path.
  * Check your code for use of deprecated macros. Add a
    #define LZO_CFG_COMPAT if necessary.
  * Other than that LZO v2 should be fully source-compatible with LZO v1.
    Of course, the compressed data is fully compatible as well.
  * Re-compile and re-link your application.
  * Enjoy the improvements!
