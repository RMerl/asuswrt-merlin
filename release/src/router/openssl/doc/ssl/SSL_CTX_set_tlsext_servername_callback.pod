=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback, SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg,
SSL_get_servername_type, SSL_get_servername - handle server name indication
(SNI)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 long SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback(SSL_CTX *ctx,
                                   int (*cb)(SSL *, int *, void *));
 long SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg(SSL_CTX *ctx, void *arg);

 const char *SSL_get_servername(const SSL *s, const int type);
 int SSL_get_servername_type(const SSL *s);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback() sets the application callback B<cb>
used by a server to perform any actions or configuration required based on
the servername extension received in the incoming connection. When B<cb>
is NULL, SNI is not used. The B<arg> value is a pointer which is passed to
the application callback.

SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg() sets a context-specific argument to be
passed into the callback for this B<SSL_CTX>.

SSL_get_servername() returns a servername extension value of the specified
type if provided in the Client Hello or NULL.

SSL_get_servername_type() returns the servername type or -1 if no servername
is present. Currently the only supported type (defined in RFC3546) is
B<TLSEXT_NAMETYPE_host_name>.

=head1 NOTES

The ALPN and SNI callbacks are both executed during Client Hello processing.
The servername callback is executed first, followed by the ALPN callback.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback() and
SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg() both always return 1 indicating success.
