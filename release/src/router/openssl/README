 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

 The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
 commercial-grade, fully featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSLv3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as
 well as a full-strength general purpose cryptograpic library. The project is
 managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to
 communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related
 documentation.

 OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
 and Tim J. Hudson.  The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under a dual-license (the
 OpenSSL license plus the SSLeay license), which means that you are free to
 get and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes as long as you
 fulfill the conditions of both licenses.

 OVERVIEW
 --------

 The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

 libssl.a:
     Provides the client and server-side implementations for SSLv3 and TLS.

 libcrypto.a:
     Provides general cryptographic and X.509 support needed by SSL/TLS but
     not logically part of it.

 openssl:
     A command line tool that can be used for:
        Creation of key parameters
        Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
        Calculation of message digests
        Encryption and decryption
        SSL/TLS client and server tests
        Handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
        And more...

 INSTALLATION
 ------------

 See the appropriate file:
        INSTALL         Linux, Unix, etc.
        INSTALL.DJGPP   DOS platform with DJGPP
        INSTALL.NW      Netware
        INSTALL.OS2     OS/2
        INSTALL.VMS     VMS
        INSTALL.W32     Windows (32bit)
        INSTALL.W64     Windows (64bit)
        INSTALL.WCE     Windows CE

 SUPPORT
 -------

 See the OpenSSL website www.openssl.org for details on how to obtain
 commercial technical support.

 If you have any problems with OpenSSL then please take the following steps
 first:

    - Download the latest version from the repository
      to see if the problem has already been addressed
    - Configure with no-asm
    - Remove compiler optimisation flags

 If you wish to report a bug then please include the following information
 and create an issue on GitHub:

    - On Unix systems:
        Self-test report generated by 'make report'
    - On other systems:
        OpenSSL version: output of 'openssl version -a'
        OS Name, Version, Hardware platform
        Compiler Details (name, version)
    - Application Details (name, version)
    - Problem Description (steps that will reproduce the problem, if known)
    - Stack Traceback (if the application dumps core)

 Just because something doesn't work the way you expect does not mean it
 is necessarily a bug in OpenSSL.
