<h1>tdb</h1>

TDB is a Trivial Database. In concept, it is very much like GDBM, and BSD's DB 
except that it allows multiple simultaneous writers and uses locking 
internally to keep writers from trampling on each other. TDB is also extremely 
small.

<h2>Download</h2>
You can download the latest releases of tdb from the <a
href="http://samba.org/ftp/tdb">tdb directory</a> on the samba public
source archive.


<h2>Discussion and bug reports</h2>

tdb does not currently have its own mailing list or bug tracking
system. For now, please use the <a
href="https://lists.samba.org/mailman/listinfo/samba-technical">samba-technical</a>
mailing list, and the <a href="http://bugzilla.samba.org/">Samba
bugzilla</a> bug tracking system.

<h2>Download</h2>

You can download the latest code either via git or rsync.<br>
<br>
To fetch via git see the following guide:<br>
<a href="http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Using_Git_for_Samba_Development">Using Git for Samba Development</a><br>
Once you have cloned the tree switch to the master branch and cd into the source/lib/tdb directory.<br>
<br>
To fetch via rsync use these commands:

<pre>
  rsync -Pavz samba.org::ftp/unpacked/standalone_projects/lib/tdb .
  rsync -Pavz samba.org::ftp/unpacked/standalone_projects/lib/replace .
</pre>

and build in tdb. It will find the replace library in the directory
above automatically.
