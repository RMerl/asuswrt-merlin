This is the popt command line option parsing library. While it is similiar
to getopt(3), it contains a number of enhancements, including:

	1) popt is fully reentrant
	2) popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays while 
	   getopt(2) makes this quite difficult
	3) popt allows users to alias command line arguments
	4) popt provides convience functions for parsing strings
	   into argv[] style arrays

popt is used by rpm, the Red Hat install program, and many other Red Hat
utilities, all of which provide excellent examples of how to use popt. 
Complete documentation on popt is available in popt.ps (included in this
tarball), which is excerpted with permission from the book "Linux
Application Development" by Michael K. Johnson and Erik Troan (available
from Addison Wesley in May, 1998).

Comments on popt should be addressed to ewt@redhat.com.
