testtools is a set of extensions to the Python standard library's unit testing
framework.

These extensions have been derived from years of experience with unit testing
in Python and come from many different sources.

History
-------

testtools used to be called 'pyunit3k'.  The name was changed to avoid
conflating the library with the Python 3.0 release (commonly referred to as
'py3k').
