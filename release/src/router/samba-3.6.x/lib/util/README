This directory contains libutil (until we can think of a better name)

The idea is that this library contains simple but useful data structures 
and support functions that are generally useful; not just for Samba but for 
other projects as well. Functions here should not depend on any external 
libraries, just on libc (perhaps partially provided by libreplace).
