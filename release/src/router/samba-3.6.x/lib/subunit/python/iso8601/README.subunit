This is a [slightly rearranged] import of http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iso8601/
version 0.1.4. The OS X hidden files have been stripped, and the package
turned into a single module, to simplify installation. The remainder of the
source distribution is included in the subunit source tree at python/iso8601
for reference.
