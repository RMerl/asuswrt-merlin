A simple package to deal with ISO 8601 date time formats.

ISO 8601 defines a neutral, unambiguous date string format, which also
has the property of sorting naturally.

e.g. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ or 2007-01-25T12:00:00Z

Currently this covers only the most common date formats encountered, not
all of ISO 8601 is handled.

Currently the following formats are handled:

* 2006-01-01T00:00:00Z
* 2006-01-01T00:00:00[+-]00:00

I'll add more as I encounter them in my day to day life. Patches with 
new formats and tests will be gratefully accepted of course :)
