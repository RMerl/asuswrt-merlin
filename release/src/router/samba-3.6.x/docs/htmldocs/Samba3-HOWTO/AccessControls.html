Advanced MS Windows users are frequently perplexed when file, directory, and share manipulation of
resources shared via Samba do not behave in the manner they might expect. MS Windows network
administrators are often confused regarding network access controls and how to
provide users with the access they need while protecting resources from unauthorized access.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id378401"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id378408"></a>
Many UNIX administrators are unfamiliar with the MS Windows environment and in particular
have difficulty in visualizing what the MS Windows user wishes to achieve in attempts to set file
and directory access permissions. 
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id378420"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id378427"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id378434"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id378440"></a>
The problem lies in the differences in how file and directory permissions and controls work
between the two environments. This difference is one that Samba cannot completely hide, even
though it does try to bridge the chasm to a degree.

POSIX Access Control List technology has been available (along with extended attributes)
for UNIX for many years, yet there is little evidence today of any significant use. This
explains to some extent the slow adoption of ACLs into commercial Linux products. MS Windows
administrators are astounded at this, given that ACLs were a foundational capability of the now
decade-old MS Windows NT operating system.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id378488"></a>
The purpose of this chapter is to present each of the points of control that are possible with
Samba-3 in the hope that this will help the network administrator to find the optimum method
for delivering the best environment for MS Windows desktop users.

This is an opportune point to mention that Samba was created to provide a means of interoperability
and interchange of data between differing operating environments. Samba has no intent to change
UNIX/Linux into a platform like MS Windows. Instead the purpose was and is to provide a sufficient
level of exchange of data between the two environments. What is available today extends well
beyond early plans and expectations, yet the gap continues to shrink.

	Samba offers much flexibility in file system access management. These are the key access control
	facilities present in Samba today:

			Samba honors and implements UNIX file system access controls. Users
			who access a Samba server will do so as a particular MS Windows user.
			This information is passed to the Samba server as part of the logon or
			connection setup process. Samba uses this user identity to validate
			whether or not the user should be given access to file system resources
			(files and directories). This chapter provides an overview for those
			to whom the UNIX permissions and controls are a little strange or unknown.

<a class="indexterm" name="id378591"></a>
			In configuring share settings and controls in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file,
			the network administrator can exercise overrides to native file
			system permissions and behaviors. This can be handy and convenient
			to effect behavior that is more like what MS Windows NT users expect,
			but it is seldom the <span class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span> way to achieve this.

<a class="indexterm" name="id378632"></a>
			Just as it is possible in MS Windows NT to set ACLs on shares
			themselves, so it is possible to do in Samba.
			Few people make use of this facility, yet it remains one of the
			easiest ways to affect access controls (restrictions) and can often
			do so with minimum invasiveness compared with other methods.

			The use of POSIX ACLs on UNIX/Linux is possible only if the underlying
			operating system supports them. If not, then this option will not be
			available to you. Current UNIX technology platforms have native support
			for POSIX ACLs. There are patches for the Linux kernel that also provide
			this support. Sadly, few Linux platforms ship today with native ACLs and
			extended attributes enabled. This chapter has pertinent information

Perhaps the most important recognition to be made is the simple fact that MS Windows NT4/200x/XP
implement a totally divergent file system technology from what is provided in the UNIX operating system
environment. First we consider what the most significant differences are, then we look
at how Samba helps to bridge the differences.
</p><div class="sect2" title="MS Windows NTFS Comparison with UNIX File Systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id378699"></a>MS Windows NTFS Comparison with UNIX File Systems</h3></div></div></div><p>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id378730"></a>
	Samba operates on top of the UNIX file system. This means it is subject to UNIX file system conventions
	and permissions. It also means that if the MS Windows networking environment requires file system
	behavior, that differs from UNIX file system behavior then somehow Samba is responsible for emulating
	that in a transparent and consistent manner.
	</p><p>
	It is good news that Samba does this to a large extent, and on top of that, provides a high degree
	of optional configuration to override the default behavior. We look at some of these overrides,
	but for the greater part we stay within the bounds of default behavior. Those wishing to explore
	the depths of control ability should review the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> man page.
	</p><p>The following compares file system features for UNIX with those of MS Windows NT/200x:
	<a class="indexterm" name="id378761"></a>
	
	</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Name Space</span></dt><dd><p>
		MS Windows NT4/200x/XP file names may be up to 254 characters long, and UNIX file names
		may be 1023 characters long. In MS Windows, file extensions indicate particular file types;
		in UNIX this is not so rigorously observed because all names are considered arbitrary. 
		</p><p>
		What MS Windows calls a folder, UNIX calls a directory.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Case Sensitivity</span></dt><dd><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id378803"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id378810"></a>
		MS Windows file names are generally uppercase if made up of 8.3 (8-character file name
		and 3 character extension. File names that are longer than 8.3 are case preserving and case
		insensitive.
		</p><p>
		UNIX file and directory names are case sensitive and case preserving. Samba implements the
		MS Windows file name behavior, but it does so as a user application. The UNIX file system
		provides no mechanism to perform case-insensitive file name lookups. MS Windows does this
		by default. This means that Samba has to carry the processing overhead to provide features
		that are not native to the UNIX operating system environment.
		</p><p>
		Consider the following. All are unique UNIX names but one single MS Windows file name:
		</p><pre class="screen">
				MYFILE.TXT
				MyFile.txt
				myfile.txt
		</pre><p>
		So clearly, in an MS Windows file namespace these three files cannot co-exist, but in UNIX
		they can.
		</p><p>
		So what should Samba do if all three are present? That which is lexically first will be
		accessible to MS Windows users; the others are invisible and unaccessible  any
		other solution would be suicidal. The Windows client will ask for a case-insensitive file
		lookup, and that is the reason for which Samba must offer a consistent selection in the
		event that the UNIX directory contains multiple files that would match a case insensitive
		file listing.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Directory Separators</span></dt><dd><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id378863"></a>
		MS Windows and DOS use the backslash <code class="constant">\</code> as a directory delimiter, and UNIX uses
		the forward-slash <code class="constant">/</code> as its directory delimiter. This is handled transparently by Samba.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Drive Identification</span></dt><dd><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id378888"></a>
		MS Windows products support a notion of drive letters, like <code class="literal">C:</code>, to represent
		disk partitions. UNIX has no concept of separate identifiers for file partitions; each
		such file system is mounted to become part of the overall directory tree.
		The UNIX directory tree begins at <code class="constant">/</code> just as the root of a DOS drive is specified as
		<code class="constant">C:\</code>.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">File Naming Conventions</span></dt><dd><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id378922"></a>
		MS Windows generally never experiences file names that begin with a dot (<code class="constant">.</code>), while in UNIX these
		are commonly found in a user's home directory. Files that begin with a dot (<code class="constant">.</code>) are typically
		startup files for various UNIX applications, or they may be files that contain
		startup configuration data.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Links and Short-Cuts</span></dt><dd><p>

		<a class="indexterm" name="id378958"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id378967"></a>
		MS Windows make use of <span class="emphasis"><em>links and shortcuts</em></span> that are actually special types of files that will
		redirect an attempt to execute the file to the real location of the file. UNIX knows of file and directory
		links, but they are entirely different from what MS Windows users are used to.
		</p><p>
		Symbolic links are files in UNIX that contain the actual location of the data (file or directory). An
		operation (like read or write) will operate directly on the file referenced. Symbolic links are also
		referred to as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">soft links.</span>&#8221;</span> A hard link is something that MS Windows is not familiar with. It allows
		one physical file to be known simultaneously by more than one file name.

	There are many other subtle differences that may cause the MS Windows administrator some temporary discomfort

	The network administrator is strongly advised to read basic UNIX training manuals and reference materials
	regarding file and directory permissions maintenance. Much can be achieved with the basic UNIX permissions
	without having to resort to more complex facilities like POSIX ACLs or extended attributes (EAs).

	the (r) read flags are not set, files cannot be listed (seen) in the directory by anyone. The group can read files in the
	directory but cannot create new files. If files in the directory are set to be readable and writable for the group, then
	group members will be able to write to (or delete) them.

	People have asked on the Samba mailing list how is it possible to protect files or directories from deletion by users.
	For example, Windows NT/2K/XP provides the capacity to set access controls on a directory into which people can
	write files but not delete them. It is possible to set an ACL on a Windows file that permits the file to be written to
	but not deleted. Such concepts are foreign to the UNIX operating system file space. Within the UNIX file system
	anyone who has the ability to create a file can write to it. Anyone who has write permission on the
	directory that contains a file and has write permission for it has the capability to delete it.
	</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379532"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379539"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379546"></a>
	For the record, in the UNIX environment the ability to delete a file is controlled by the permissions on
	the directory that the file is in. In other words, a user can delete a file in a directory to which that
	user has write access, even if that user does not own the file.
	</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379558"></a>

<a class="indexterm" name="id379572"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379579"></a>
	Of necessity, Samba is subject to the file system semantics of the host operating system. Samba is therefore
	limited in the file system capabilities that can be made available through Windows ACLs, and therefore performs
	a "best fit" translation to POSIX ACLs. Some UNIX file systems do, however support, a feature known
	as extended attributes. Only the Windows concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>inheritance</em></span> is implemented by Samba through
	the appropriate extended attribute.
	</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379600"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379606"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379613"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id379620"></a>
	The specific semantics of the extended attributes are not consistent across UNIX and UNIX-like systems such as Linux.
	For example, it is possible on some implementations of the extended attributes to set a flag that prevents the directory
	or file from being deleted. The extended attribute that may achieve this is called the <code class="constant">immutable</code> bit.
	Unfortunately, the implementation of the immutable flag is NOT consistent with published documentation. For example, the
	man page for the <code class="literal">chattr</code> on SUSE Linux 9.2 says:
</p><pre class="screen">
A file with the i attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted
or renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data can be
written to the file. Only the superuser or a process possessing the
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.
</pre><p>
	A simple test can be done to check if the immutable flag is supported on files in the file system of the Samba host
	server.
	</p><div class="procedure" title="Procedure 16.1. Test for File Immutibility Support"><a name="id379651"></a><p class="title"><b>Procedure 16.1. Test for File Immutibility Support</b></p><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step" title="Step 1"><p>

	Login as the user who owns the file (not root) and attempt to remove the file as follows:

</pre><p>
	It will not be possible to delete the file if the immutable flag is correctly honored.
	</p></li></ol></div><p>
	On operating systems and file system types that support the immutable bit, it is possible to create directories
	that cannot be deleted. Check the man page on your particular host system to determine whether or not
	immutable directories are writable. If they are not, then the entire directory and its contents will effectively
	be protected from writing (file creation also) and deletion.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id379725"></a>
	The following parameters in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file sections define a share control or affect access controls.
	Before using any of the following options, please refer to the man page for <code class="filename">smb.conf</code>.

	User- and group-based controls can prove quite useful. In some situations it is distinctly desirable to
	force all file system operations as if a single user were doing so. The use of the
	<a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#FORCEUSER" target="_top">force user</a> and <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#FORCEGROUP" target="_top">force group</a> behavior will achieve this.
	In other situations it may be necessary to use a paranoia level of control to ensure that only particular
	authorized persons will be able to access a share or its contents. Here the use of the
	<a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#VALIDUSERS" target="_top">valid users</a> or the <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#INVALIDUSERS" target="_top">invalid users</a> parameter may be useful.
	</p><p>
	As always, it is highly advisable to use the easiest to maintain and the least ambiguous method for
	controlling access. Remember, when you leave the scene, someone else will need to provide assistance, and
	if he or she finds too great a mess or does not understand what you have done, there is risk of
	Samba being removed and an alternative solution being adopted.

	This section deals with how to configure Samba per-share access control restrictions.
	By default, Samba sets no restrictions on the share itself. Restrictions on the share itself
	can be set on MS Windows NT4/200x/XP shares. This can be an effective way to limit who can
	connect to a share. In the absence of specific restrictions, the default setting is to allow
	the global user <code class="constant">Everyone - Full Control</code> (full control, change and read).

<a class="indexterm" name="id380772"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id380779"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id380786"></a>
	At this time Samba does not provide a tool for configuring access control settings on the share
	itself.  The only way to create those settings is to use either the NT4 Server Manager or the Windows 200x
	Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for Computer Management. There are currently no plans to provide
	this capability in the Samba command-line tool set.

<a class="indexterm" name="id380812"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id380819"></a>
	Samba stores the per-share access control settings in a file called <code class="filename">share_info.tdb</code>.
	The location of this file on your system will depend on how Samba was compiled. The default location
	for Samba's tdb files is under <code class="filename">/usr/local/samba/var</code>. If the <code class="filename">tdbdump</code>
	utility has been compiled and installed on your system, then you can examine the contents of this file
	by executing <code class="literal">tdbdump share_info.tdb</code> in the directory containing the tdb files.

		All access to UNIX/Linux system files via Samba is controlled by the operating system file access controls.

		From an NT4/2000/XP client, right-click on any file or directory in a Samba-mounted drive letter
		or UNC path. When the menu pops up, click on the <span class="guilabel">Properties</span> entry at the bottom

		<span class="guilabel">Security</span> tab and you will see three buttons: <span class="guibutton">Permissions</span>,
		<span class="guibutton">Auditing</span>, and <span class="guibutton">Ownership</span>. The <span class="guibutton">Auditing</span>
		button will cause either an error message <span class="errorname">"A requested privilege is not held by the client"</span>
		to appear if the user is not the NT administrator, or a dialog intended to allow an administrator
		to add auditing requirements to a file if the user is logged on as the NT administrator. This dialog is
		nonfunctional with a Samba share at this time, because the only useful button, the <span class="guibutton">Add</span>
		button, will not currently allow a list of users to be seen.

		Clicking on the <span class="guibutton">Ownership</span> button brings up a dialog box telling you who owns
		the given file. The owner name will be displayed like this:
		</p><pre class="screen">
		<code class="constant">SERVER\user (Long name)</code>
		</pre><p>
		<em class="replaceable"><code>SERVER</code></em> is the NetBIOS name of the Samba server, <em class="replaceable"><code>user</code></em>
		is the username of the UNIX user who owns the file, and <em class="replaceable"><code>(Long name)</code></em> is the
		descriptive string identifying the user (normally found in the GECOS field of the UNIX password database).
		Click on the <span class="guibutton">Close</span> button to remove this dialog.
		</p><p>
		If the parameter <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#NTACLSUPPORT" target="_top">nt acl support</a> is set to <code class="constant">false</code>,
		the file owner will be shown as the NT user <span class="emphasis"><em>Everyone</em></span>.
		</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id381355"></a>
		The <span class="guibutton">Take Ownership</span> button will not allow you to change the ownership of this file to
		yourself (clicking it will display a dialog box complaining that the user as whom you are currently logged onto
		the NT client cannot be found). The reason for this is that changing the ownership of a file is a privileged
		operation in UNIX, available only to the <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span> user. Because clicking on this button causes
		NT to attempt to change the ownership of a file to the current user logged into the NT client, this will
		not work with Samba at this time.
		</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id381379"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id381386"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id381392"></a>
		There is an NT <code class="literal">chown</code> command that will work with Samba and allow a user with administrator
		privilege connected to a Samba server as root to change the ownership of files on both a local NTFS file system
		or remote mounted NTFS or Samba drive. This is available as part of the <span class="application">Seclib</span> NT
		security library written by Jeremy Allison of the Samba Team and is downloadable from the main Samba FTP site.

		The third button is the <span class="guibutton">Permissions</span> button. Clicking on it brings up a dialog box
		that shows both the permissions and the UNIX owner of the file or directory. The owner is displayed like this:
		</p><p><code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>SERVER</code></em>\
				<em class="replaceable"><code>user</code></em> 
				<em class="replaceable"><code>(Long name)</code></em></code></p><p><em class="replaceable"><code>SERVER</code></em> is the NetBIOS name of the Samba server,
		<em class="replaceable"><code>user</code></em> is the username of the UNIX user who owns the file, and
		<em class="replaceable"><code>(Long name)</code></em> is the descriptive string identifying the user (normally found in the
		GECOS field of the UNIX password database).</p><p>
		If the parameter <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#NTACLSUPPORT" target="_top">nt acl support</a> is set to <code class="constant">false</code>,
		the file owner will be shown as the NT user <code class="constant">Everyone</code>, and the permissions will be
		shown as NT <span class="emphasis"><em>Full Control</em></span>.
		</p><p>
		The permissions field is displayed differently for files and directories. Both are discussed next.
		</p><div class="sect3" title="File Permissions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id381493"></a>File Permissions</h4></div></div></div><p>
		The standard UNIX user/group/world triplet and the corresponding <code class="constant">read, write,
		execute</code> permissions triplets are mapped by Samba into a three-element NT ACL with the
		<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">r</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">w</span>&#8221;</span>, and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">x</span>&#8221;</span> bits mapped into the corresponding NT
		permissions. The UNIX world permissions are mapped into the global NT group <code class="constant">Everyone</code>, followed 
		by the list of permissions allowed for the UNIX world. The UNIX owner and group permissions are displayed as an NT 
		<span class="guiicon">user</span> icon and an NT <span class="guiicon">local group</span> icon, respectively, followed by the list 
		of permissions allowed for the UNIX user and group.
		</p><p>
		Because many UNIX permission sets do not map into common NT names such as <code class="constant">read</code>,
		<code class="constant">change</code>, or <code class="constant">full control</code>, usually the permissions will be prefixed
		by the words <code class="constant">Special Access</code> in the NT display list.
		</p><p>
		But what happens if the file has no permissions allowed for a particular UNIX user group or world component?
		In order to  allow <span class="emphasis"><em>no permissions</em></span> to be seen and modified, Samba then overloads the NT
		<code class="constant">Take Ownership</code> ACL attribute (which has no meaning in UNIX) and reports a component with
		no permissions as having the NT <code class="literal">O</code> bit set.  This was chosen, of course, to make it look
		like a zero, meaning zero permissions. More details on the decision behind this action are given below.
		</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Directory Permissions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id381576"></a>Directory Permissions</h4></div></div></div><p>
		Directories on an NT NTFS file system have two different sets of permissions. The first set is the ACL set on the
		directory itself, which is usually displayed in the first set of parentheses in the normal <code class="constant">RW</code> 
		NT style. This first set of permissions is created by Samba in exactly the same way as normal file permissions are, described 
		above, and is displayed in the same way.
		</p><p>
		The second set of directory permissions has no real meaning in the UNIX permissions world and represents the <code class="constant">
		inherited</code> permissions that any file created within this directory would inherit.
		</p><p>
		Samba synthesizes these inherited permissions for NT by returning as an NT ACL the UNIX permission mode that a new file 
		created by Samba on this share would receive.
		</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Modifying File or Directory Permissions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id381607"></a>Modifying File or Directory Permissions</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Modifying file and directory permissions is as simple as changing the displayed permissions in the dialog box
	and clicking on <span class="guibutton">OK</span>. However, there are limitations that a user needs to be aware of,
	and also interactions with the standard Samba permission masks and mapping of DOS attributes that also need to
	be taken into account.
	</p><p>
	If the parameter <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#NTACLSUPPORT" target="_top">nt acl support</a> is set to <code class="constant">false</code>, any attempt to
	set security permissions will fail with an <span class="errorname">"Access Denied" </span> message.
	</p><p>
	The first thing to note is that the <span class="guibutton">Add</span> button will not return a list of users in Samba
	(it will give an error message saying <span class="errorname">"The remote procedure call failed and did not
	execute"</span>). This means that you can only manipulate the current user/group/world permissions listed
	in the dialog box. This actually works quite well because these are the only permissions that UNIX actually
	has.
	</p><p>
	If a permission triplet (either user, group, or world) is removed from the list of permissions in the NT
	dialog box, then when the <span class="guibutton">OK</span> button is pressed, it will be applied as <span class="emphasis"><em>no
	permissions</em></span> on the UNIX side. If you view the permissions again, the <span class="emphasis"><em>no
	permissions</em></span> entry will appear as the NT <code class="literal">O</code> flag, as described above. This allows
	you to add permissions back to a file or directory once you have removed them from a triplet component.
	</p><p>
	Because UNIX supports only the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">r</span>&#8221;</span>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">w</span>&#8221;</span>, and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">x</span>&#8221;</span> bits of an NT ACL, if
	other NT security attributes such as <code class="constant">Delete Access</code> are selected, they will be ignored
	when applied on the Samba server.
	</p><p>
	When setting permissions on a directory, the second set of permissions (in the second set of parentheses) is
	by default applied to all files within that directory. If this is not what you want, you must uncheck the
	<span class="guilabel">Replace permissions on existing files</span> checkbox in the NT dialog before clicking on
	<span class="guibutton">OK</span>.
	</p><p>
	If you wish to remove all permissions from a user/group/world  component, you may either highlight the
	component and click on the <span class="guibutton">Remove</span> button or set the component to only have the special
	<code class="constant">Take Ownership</code> permission (displayed as <code class="literal">O</code>) highlighted.
	</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Interaction with the Standard Samba &#8220;create mask&#8221; Parameters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id381747"></a>Interaction with the Standard Samba <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">create mask</span>&#8221;</span> Parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>There are four parameters that control interaction with the standard Samba <em class="parameter"><code>create mask</code></em> parameters:
	

	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#SECURITYMASK" target="_top">security mask</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#FORCESECURITYMODE" target="_top">force security mode</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#DIRECTORYSECURITYMASK" target="_top">directory security mask</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#FORCEDIRECTORYSECURITYMODE" target="_top">force directory security mode</a></p></li></ul></div><p>

	</p><p>
	When a user clicks on <span class="guibutton">OK</span> to apply the 
	permissions, Samba maps the given permissions into a user/group/world 
	r/w/x triplet set, and then checks the changed permissions for a 
	file against the bits set in the  
	<a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#SECURITYMASK" target="_top">security mask</a> parameter. Any bits that 
	were changed that are not set to <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> in this parameter are left alone 
	in the file permissions.</p><p>
	Essentially, zero bits in the <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#SECURITYMASK" target="_top">security mask</a>
	may be treated as a set of bits the user is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> 
	allowed to change, and one bits are those the user is allowed to change.
	</p><p>
	If not explicitly set, this parameter defaults to the same value as 
	the <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#CREATEMASK" target="_top">create mask</a> parameter. To allow a user to modify all the
	user/group/world permissions on a file, set this parameter to 0777.
	</p><p>
	Next Samba checks the changed permissions for a file against the bits set in the 
	<a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#FORCESECURITYMODE" target="_top">force security mode</a> parameter. Any bits 
	that were changed that correspond to bits set to <span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> in this parameter 
	are forced to be set.</p><p>
	Essentially, bits set in the <em class="parameter"><code>force security mode</code></em> parameter
	may be treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security on a file, the user 
	has always set to be <span class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span>.</p><p>
	If not explicitly set, this parameter defaults to the same value 
	as the <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#FORCECREATEMODE" target="_top">force create mode</a> parameter.
	To allow a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a file
	with no restrictions, set this parameter to 000. The
	<a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#SECURITYMASK" target="_top">security mask</a> and <em class="parameter"><code>force 
	security mode</code></em> parameters are applied to the change 
	request in that order.</p><p>
	For a directory, Samba performs the same operations as 
	described above for a file except it uses the parameter <em class="parameter"><code>
	directory security mask</code></em> instead of <em class="parameter"><code>security 
	mask</code></em>, and <em class="parameter"><code>force directory security mode
	</code></em> parameter instead of <em class="parameter"><code>force security mode
	</code></em>.</p><p>
	The <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#DIRECTORYSECURITYMASK" target="_top">directory security mask</a> parameter 
	by default is set to the same value as the <em class="parameter"><code>directory mask
	</code></em> parameter and the <em class="parameter"><code>force directory security 
	mode</code></em> parameter by default is set to the same value as 
	the <a class="link" href="smb.conf.5.html#FORCEDIRECTORYMODE" target="_top">force directory mode</a> parameter.
	In this way Samba enforces the permission restrictions that 
	an administrator can set on a Samba share, while still allowing users 
	to modify the permission bits within that restriction.</p><p>
	If you want to set up a share that allows users full control
	in modifying the permission bits on their files and directories and
	does not force any particular bits to be set <span class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span>,
	then set the following parameters in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file in that
	share-specific section:
	</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id382036"></a><em class="parameter"><code>security mask = 0777</code></em></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id382047"></a><em class="parameter"><code>force security mode = 0</code></em></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id382059"></a><em class="parameter"><code>directory security mask = 0777</code></em></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id382070"></a><em class="parameter"><code>force directory security mode = 0</code></em></td></tr></table></div><div class="sect2" title="Interaction with the Standard Samba File Attribute Mapping"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id382083"></a>Interaction with the Standard Samba File Attribute Mapping</h3></div></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	Samba maps some of the DOS attribute bits (such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">read-only</span>&#8221;</span>)
	into the UNIX permissions of a file. This means there can 
	be a conflict between the permission bits set via the security 
	dialog and the permission bits set by the file attribute mapping.
	</p></div><p>
	If a file has no UNIX read access for the owner, it will show up
	as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">read-only</span>&#8221;</span> in the standard file attributes tabbed dialog.
	Unfortunately, this dialog is the same one that contains the security information
	in another tab.
	</p><p>
	What this can mean is that if the owner changes the permissions
	to allow himself or herself read access using the security dialog, clicks on
	<span class="guibutton">OK</span> to get back to the standard attributes tab 
	dialog, and clicks on <span class="guibutton">OK</span> on that dialog, then 
	NT will set the file permissions back to read-only (as that is what 
	the attributes still say in the dialog). This means that after setting 
	permissions and clicking on <span class="guibutton">OK</span> to get back to the 
	attributes dialog, you should always press <span class="guibutton">Cancel</span> 
	rather than <span class="guibutton">OK</span> to ensure that your changes 
	are not overridden.

	Windows administrators are familiar with simple ACL controls, and they typically
	consider that UNIX user/group/other (ugo) permissions are inadequate and not
	sufficiently fine-grained.
	</p><p>
	Competing SMB implementations differ in how they handle Windows ACLs. Samba handles
	Windows ACLs from the perspective of UNIX file system administration and thus adopts
	the limitations of POSIX ACLs. Therefore, where POSIX ACLs lack a capability of the
	Windows NT/200X ACLs, the POSIX semantics and limitations are imposed on the Windows
	administrator.
	</p><p>
	POSIX ACLs present an interesting challenge to the UNIX administrator and therefore
	force a compromise to be applied to Windows ACLs administration. POSIX ACLs are not
	covered by an official standard; rather, the latest standard is a draft standard
	1003.1e revision 17. This is the POSIX document on which the Samba implementation has
	been implemented.
	</p><p>
	UNIX vendors differ in the manner in which POSIX ACLs are implemented. There are a
	number of Linux file systems that support ACLs. Samba has to provide a way to make
	transparent all the differences between the various implementations of POSIX ACLs.
	The pressure for ACLs support in Samba has noticeably increased the pressure to
	standardize ACLs support in the UNIX world.
	</p><p>
	Samba has to deal with the complicated matter of handling the challenge of the Windows
	ACL that implements <span class="emphasis"><em>inheritance</em></span>, a concept not anticipated by POSIX
	ACLs as implemented in UNIX file systems. Samba provides support for <span class="emphasis"><em>masks</em></span>
	that permit normal ugo and ACLs functionality to be overridden. This further complicates
	the way in which Windows ACLs must be implemented.
	</p><div class="sect3" title="UNIX POSIX ACL Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id382190"></a>UNIX POSIX ACL Overview</h4></div></div></div><p>
	In examining POSIX ACLs we must consider the manner in which they operate for 
	both files and directories. File ACLs have the following significance:
</p><pre class="screen">
# file: testfile      &lt;- the file name
# owner: jeremy       &lt;-- the file owner
# group: users        &lt;-- the POSIX group owner

	As can be seen from the mapping table, there is no one-to-one mapping capability, and therefore
	Samba must make a logical mapping that will permit Windows to operate more-or-less the way
	that is intended by the administrator.
	</p><p>
	In general the mapping of UNIX POSIX user/group/other permissions will be mapped to
	Windows ACLs. This has precedence over the creation of POSIX ACLs. POSIX ACLs are necessary
	to establish access controls for users and groups other than the user and group that
	own the file or directory.
	</p><p>
	The UNIX administrator can set any directory permission from within the UNIX environment.
	The Windows administrator is more restricted in that it is not possible from within 
	Windows Explorer to remove read permission for the file owner.

		<span class="emphasis"><em>Question:</em></span> <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">When user B saves a word document that is owned by user A,
		the updated file is now owned by user B.  Why is Samba doing this? How do I fix this?</span>&#8221;</span>
		</p><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Answer:</em></span> Word does the following when you modify/change a Word document: MS Word creates a new document with
		a temporary name. Word then closes the old document and deletes it, then renames the new document to the original document name.
		There is no mechanism by which Samba can in any way know that the new document really should be owned by the owners
		of the original file. Samba has no way of knowing that the file will be renamed by MS Word. As far as Samba is able
		to tell, the file that gets created is a new file, not one that the application (Word) is updating.
		</p><p>
		There is a workaround to solve the permissions problem. It involves understanding how you can manage file
		system behavior from within the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file, as well as understanding how UNIX file systems work. Set on the directory
		in which you are changing Word documents: <code class="literal">chmod g+s `directory_name'.</code> This ensures that all files will
		be created with the group that owns the directory. In <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> share declaration section set:
		</p><p>
		</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id382935"></a><em class="parameter"><code>force create mode = 0660</code></em></td></tr><tr><td><a class="indexterm" name="id382946"></a><em class="parameter"><code>force directory mode = 0770</code></em></td></tr></table><p>
		</p><p>
		These two settings will ensure that all directories and files that get created in the share will be readable/writable by the
		owner and group set on the directory itself.
