It was a little difficult to select an appropriate title for this chapter.
From email messages on the Samba mailing lists it is clear that many people
consider the updating and upgrading of Samba to be a migration matter. Others
talk about migrating Samba servers when in fact the issue at hand is one of
installing a new Samba server to replace an older existing Samba server.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id366063"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id366070"></a>
There has also been much talk about migration of Samba-3 from an smbpasswd
passdb backend to the use of the tdbsam or ldapsam facilities that are new
to Samba-3.
</p><p>
Clearly, there is not a great deal of clarity in the terminology that various
people apply to these modes by which Samba servers are updated. This is further 
highlighted by an email posting that included the following neat remark:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id366088"></a>
I like the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">net rpc vampire</span>&#8221;</span> on NT4, but that to my surprise does
not seem to work against a Samba PDC and, if addressed in the Samba to Samba
context in either book, I could not find it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id366107"></a>
So in response to the significant request for these situations to be better 
documented, this chapter has now been added. User contributions and documentation
of real-world experiences are a most welcome addition to this chapter.
</p><div class="sect1" title="Introduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id366117"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>

A Windows network administrator explained in an email what changes he was
planning to make and followed with the question: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Anyone done this
before?</span>&#8221;</span> Many of us have upgraded and updated Samba without incident.
Others have experienced much pain and user frustration. So it is to be hoped
that the notes in this chapter will make a positive difference by assuring
that someone will be saved a lot of discomfort.
</p><p>
Before anyone commences an upgrade or an update of Samba, the one cardinal
rule that must be observed is: Backup all Samba configuration files in
case it is necessary to revert to the old version. Even if you do not like
this precautionary step, users will punish an administrator who
fails to take adequate steps to avoid situations that may inflict lost
productivity on them.
</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id366163"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id366170"></a>
Samba makes it possible to upgrade and update configuration files, but it
is not possible to downgrade the configuration files. Please ensure that
all configuration and control files are backed up to permit a down-grade
in the rare event that this may be necessary.
</p></div><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id366182"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id366189"></a>
It is prudent also to backup all data files on the server before attempting
to perform a major upgrade. Many administrators have experienced the consequences
of failure to take adequate precautions. So what is adequate? That is simple!
If data is lost during an upgrade or update and it can not be restored,
the precautions taken were inadequate. If a backup was not needed, but was available,
caution was on the side of the victor.
</p><div class="sect2" title="Cautions and Notes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id366200"></a>Cautions and Notes</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Someone once said, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">It is good to be sorry, but better never to need to be!</span>&#8221;</span>
	These are wise words of advice to those contemplating a Samba upgrade or update.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366216"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366223"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366230"></a>
	This is as good a time as any to define the terms <code class="constant">upgrade</code> and
	<code class="constant">update</code>. The term <code class="constant">upgrade</code> refers to
	the installation of a version of Samba that is a whole generation or more ahead of
	that which is installed. Generations are indicated by the first digit of the version
	number. So far Samba has been released in generations 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, and currently 4.0
	is in development.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366254"></a>
	The term <code class="constant">update</code> refers to a minor version number installation
	in place of one of the same generation. For example, updating from Samba 3.0.10 to 3.0.14
	is an update. The move from Samba 2.0.7 to 3.0.14 is an upgrade.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366269"></a>
	While the use of these terms is an exercise in semantics, what needs to be realized
	is that there are major functional differences between a Samba 2.x release and a Samba
	3.0.x release. Such differences may require a significantly different approach to
	solving the same networking challenge and generally require careful review of the
	latest documentation to identify precisely how the new installation may need to be
	modified to preserve prior functionality.
	</p><p>
	There is an old axiom that says, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">The greater the volume of the documentation,
	the greater the risk that noone will read it, but where there is no documentation,
	noone can read it!</span>&#8221;</span> While true, some documentation is an evil necessity.
	It is hoped that this update to the documentation will avoid both extremes.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id366337"></a>
	Before the days of Windows NT and OS/2, every Windows and DOS networking client
	that used the SMB protocols was an entirely autonomous entity. There was no concept
	of a security identifier for a machine or a user outside of the username, the
	machine name, and the workgroup name. In actual fact, these were not security identifiers
	in the same context as the way that the SID is used since the development of
	Windows NT 3.10.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366353"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366360"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366367"></a>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id366380"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366387"></a>
	Versions of Samba prior to 1.9 did not make use of a SID. Instead they make exclusive use
	of the username that is embedded in the SessionSetUpAndX component of the connection
	setup process between a Windows client and an SMB/CIFS server. 
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366402"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366409"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366415"></a>
	Around November 1997 support was added to Samba-1.9 to handle the Windows security
	RPC-based protocols that implemented support for Samba to store a machine SID. This
	information was stored in a file called <code class="filename">MACHINE.SID.</code>
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366433"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366440"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366446"></a>
	Within the lifetime of the early Samba 2.x series, the machine SID information was
	relocated into a tdb file called <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code>, which is where
	it is still located in Samba 3.0.x along with other information that pertains to the
	local machine and its role within a domain security context.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366464"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366474"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366483"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366489"></a>
	There are two types of SID, those pertaining to the machine itself and the domain to
	which it may belong, and those pertaining to users and groups within the security
	context of the local machine, in the case of standalone servers (SAS) and domain member
	servers (DMS).
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366501"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366508"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366515"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366522"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366529"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366535"></a>
	When the Samba <code class="literal">smbd</code> daemon is first started, if the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code>
	file does not exist, it is created at the first client connection attempt. If this file does
	exist, <code class="literal">smbd</code> checks that there is a machine SID (if it is a domain controller,
	it searches for the domain SID). If <code class="literal">smbd</code> does not find one for the current
	name of the machine or for the current name of the workgroup, a new SID will be generated and
	then written to the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file. The SID is generated in a nondeterminative
	manner. This means that each time it is generated for a particular combination of machine name
	(hostname) and domain name (workgroup), it will be different.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366580"></a>
	The SID is the key used by MS Windows networking for all networking operations. This means
	that when the machine or domain SID changes, all security-encoded objects such as profiles
	and ACLs may become unusable.
	</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	It is of paramount importance that the machine and domain SID be backed up so that in
	the event of a change of hostname (machine name) or domain name (workgroup) the SID can
	be restored to its previous value.
	</p></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366598"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366604"></a>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id366658"></a>
	In Samba-3 on a domain controller (PDC or BDC), the domain name controls the domain
	SID. On all prior versions the hostname (computer name, or NetBIOS name) controlled
	the SID. On a standalone server the hostname still controls the SID.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366670"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366679"></a>
	The local machine SID can be backed up using this procedure (Samba-3):
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> net getlocalsid &gt; /etc/samba/my-local-SID
</pre><p>
	The contents of the file <code class="filename">/etc/samba/my-local-SID</code> will be:
</p><pre class="screen">
SID for domain FRODO is: S-1-5-21-726309263-4128913605-1168186429
</pre><p>
	This SID can be restored by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> net setlocalsid S-1-5-21-726309263-4128913605-1168186429
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	Samba 1.9.x stored the machine SID in the the file <code class="filename">/etc/MACHINE.SID</code>
	from which it could be recovered and stored into the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file
	using the procedure shown above.
	</p><p>
	Where the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file exists and a version of Samba 2.x or later
	has been used, there is no specific need to go through this update process. Samba-3 has the
	ability to read the older tdb file and to perform an in-situ update to the latest tdb format.
	This is not a reversible process  it is a one-way upgrade.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366761"></a>
	In the course of the Samba 2.0.x series the <code class="literal">smbpasswd</code> was modified to
	permit the domain SID to be captured to the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> smbpasswd -S PDC -Uadministrator%password
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	The release of the Samba 2.2.x series permitted the SID to be obtained by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> smbpasswd -S PDC -Uadministrator%password
</pre><p>
	from which the SID could be copied to a file and then written to the Samba-2.2.x
	<code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> smbpasswd -W S-1-5-21-726309263-4128913605-1168186429
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366829"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366835"></a>
	Domain security information, which includes the domain SID, can be obtained from Samba-2.2.x
	systems by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> rpcclient hostname lsaquery -Uroot%password
</pre><p>
	This can also be done with Samba-3 by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> net rpc info -Uroot%password
Domain Name: MIDEARTH
Domain SID: S-1-5-21-726309263-4128913605-1168186429
Sequence number: 1113415916
Num users: 4237
Num domain groups: 86
Num local groups: 0
</pre><p>
	It is a very good practice to store this SID information in a safely kept file, just in
	case it is ever needed at a later date.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366877"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366884"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366891"></a>
	Take note that the domain SID is used extensively in Samba. Where LDAP is used for the
	<em class="parameter"><code>passdb backend</code></em>, all user, group, and trust accounts are encoded
	with the domain SID. This means that if the domain SID changes for any reason, the entire
	Samba environment can become broken and require extensive corrective action if the 
	original SID cannot be restored. Fortunately, it can be recovered from a dump of the
	LDAP database. A dump of the LDAP directory database can be obtained by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> slapcat -v -l filename.ldif
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366922"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366929"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366936"></a>
	When the domain SID has changed, roaming profiles cease to be functional. The recovery
	of roaming profiles necessitates resetting of the domain portion of the user SID
	that owns the profile. This is encoded in the <code class="filename">NTUser.DAT</code> and can be
	updated using the Samba <code class="literal">profiles</code> utility. Please be aware that not all
	Linux distributions of the Samba RPMs include this essential utility. Please do not
	complain to the Samba Team if this utility is missing; that issue that must be
	addressed to the creator of the RPM package. The Samba Team do their best to make
	available all the tools needed to manage a Samba-based Windows networking environment.
	</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Change of hostname"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id366964"></a>Change of hostname</h4></div></div></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366972"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id366981"></a>
	Samba uses two methods by which the primary NetBIOS machine name (also known as a computer
	name or the hostname) may be determined: If the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file contains a
	<em class="parameter"><code>netbios name</code></em> entry, its value will be used directly. In the absence
	of such an entry, the UNIX system hostname will be used.
	</p><p>
	Many sites have become victims of lost Samba functionality because the UNIX system
	hostname was changed for one reason or another. Such a change will cause a new machine
	SID to be generated. If this happens on a domain controller, it will also change the
	domain SID. These SIDs can be updated (restored) using the procedure outlined previously.
	</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	Do NOT change the hostname or the <em class="parameter"><code>netbios name</code></em>. If this
	is changed, be sure to reset the machine SID to the original setting. Otherwise
	there may be serious interoperability and/or operational problems.
	</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Change of Workgroup (Domain) Name"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id367023"></a>Change of Workgroup (Domain) Name</h4></div></div></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id367030"></a>
	The domain name of a Samba server is identical to the workgroup name and is
	set in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file using the <em class="parameter"><code>workgroup</code></em> parameter.
	This has been consistent throughout the history of Samba and across all versions.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id367054"></a>
	Be aware that when the workgroup name is changed, a new SID will be generated.
	The old domain SID can be reset using the procedure outlined earlier in this chapter.
	</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Location of config files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sbeug1"></a>Location of config files</h4></div></div></div><p>
	The Samba-Team has maintained a constant default location for all Samba control files
	throughout the life of the project. People who have produced binary packages of Samba
	have varied the location of the Samba control files. This has led to some confusion
	for network administrators.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id367081"></a>
	The Samba 1.9.x <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file may be found either in the <code class="filename">/etc</code>
	directory or in <code class="filename">/usr/local/samba/lib</code>.
	</p><p>
	During the life of the Samba 2.x release, the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file was relocated
	on Linux systems to the <code class="filename">/etc/samba</code> directory where it
	remains located also for Samba 3.0.x installations.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id367126"></a>
	Samba 2.x introduced the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file that is also stored in the
	<code class="filename">/etc/samba</code> directory, or in the <code class="filename">/usr/local/samba/lib</code>
	directory subsystem.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id367154"></a>
	The location at which <code class="literal">smbd</code> expects to find all configuration and control
	files is determined at the time of compilation of Samba. For versions of Samba prior to
	3.0, one way to find the expected location of these files is to execute:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> strings /usr/sbin/smbd | grep conf
<code class="prompt">root# </code> strings /usr/sbin/smbd | grep secret
<code class="prompt">root# </code> strings /usr/sbin/smbd | grep smbpasswd
</pre><p>
	Note: The <code class="literal">smbd</code> executable may be located in the path
	<code class="filename">/usr/local/samba/sbin</code>.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id367209"></a>
	Samba-3 provides a neat new way to track the location of all control files as well as to
	find the compile-time options used as the Samba package was built. Here  is how the dark
	secrets of the internals of the location of control files within Samba executables can
	be uncovered:

	It is important that both the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file and the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code>
	be backed up before attempting any upgrade. The <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file
	is version-encoded, and therefore a newer version may not work with an older version
	of Samba. A backup means that it is always possible to revert a failed or problematic
	upgrade.

	Samba-2.x had no support for Unicode; instead, all national language character-set support in file names
	was done using particular locale codepage mapping techniques. Samba-3 supports Unicode in file names, thus
	providing true internationalization support.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id367306"></a>
	Non-English users whose national language character set has special characters and who upgrade naively will 
	find that many files that have the special characters in the file name will see them garbled and jumbled up.
	This typically happens with umlauts and accents because these characters were particular to the codepage
	that was in use with Samba-2.x using an 8-bit encoding scheme.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id367320"></a>
	Files that are created with Samba-3 will use UTF-8 encoding. Should the file system ever end up with a
	mix of codepage (unix charset)-encoded file names and UTF-8-encoded file names, the mess will take some
	effort to set straight.

	A very helpful tool is available from Bjorn Jacke's <a class="ulink" href="http://j3e.de/linux/convmv/" target="_top">convmv</a>
	work. Convmv is a tool that can be used to convert file and directory names from one encoding method to
	another. The most common use for this tool is to convert locale-encoded files to UTF-8 Unicode encoding.

Sites that are being upgraded from Samba-2 (or earlier versions) to Samba-3
may experience little difficulty or may require a lot of effort, depending
on the complexity of the configuration. Samba-1.9.x upgrades to Samba-3 will
generally be simple and straightforward, although no upgrade should be
attempted without proper planning and preparation.
</p><p>
There are two basic modes of use of Samba versions prior to Samba-3. The first
does not use LDAP, the other does. Samba-1.9.x did not provide LDAP support.
Samba-2.x could be compiled with LDAP support.

		<a class="indexterm" name="id367601"></a>
		It is now safe to upgrade the Samba installation. On Linux systems

		<a class="indexterm" name="id367725"></a>
		It is now safe to start Samba using the appropriate system tool.

==========================================================
Changes in Behavior
-------------------

The following issues are known changes in behavior between Samba 2.2 and
Samba 3.0 that may affect certain installations of Samba.

  1)  When operating as a member of a Windows domain, Samba 2.2 would
      map any users authenticated by the remote DC to the 'guest account'
      if a uid could not be obtained via the getpwnam() call.  Samba 3.0
      rejects the connection as NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE.  There is no
      current work around to re-establish the 2.2 behavior.

  2)  When adding machines to a Samba 2.2 controlled domain, the
      'add user script' was used to create the UNIX identity of the
      machine trust account.  Samba 3.0 introduces a new 'add machine
      script' that must be specified for this purpose.  Samba 3.0 will
      not fall back to using the 'add user script' in the absence of
      an 'add machine script'

######################################################################
Passdb Backends and Authentication
##################################

There have been a few new changes that Samba administrators should be
aware of when moving to Samba 3.0.

  1) encrypted passwords have been enabled by default in order to
     inter-operate better with out-of-the-box Windows client
     installations.  This does mean that either (a) a samba account
     must be created for each user, or (b) 'encrypt passwords = no'
     must be explicitly defined in smb.conf.

  2) Inclusion of new 'security = ads' option for integration
     with an Active Directory domain using the native Windows
     Kerberos 5 and LDAP protocols.

     MIT kerberos 1.3.1 supports the ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5 encryption
     type which is necessary for servers on which the
     administrator password has not been changed, or kerberos-enabled
     SMB connections to servers that require Kerberos SMB signing.
     Besides this one difference, either MIT or Heimdal Kerberos
     distributions are usable by Samba 3.0.


Samba 3.0 also includes the possibility of setting up chains
of authentication methods (auth methods) and account storage
backends (passdb backend).  Please refer to the smb.conf(5)
man page for details.  While both parameters assume sane default
values, it is likely that you will need to understand what the
values actually mean in order to ensure Samba operates correctly.

The recommended passdb backends at this time are

  * smbpasswd - 2.2 compatible flat file format
  * tdbsam - attribute rich database intended as an smbpasswd
    replacement for stand alone servers
  * ldapsam - attribute rich account storage and retrieval
    backend utilizing an LDAP directory.
  * ldapsam_compat - a 2.2 backward compatible LDAP account
    backend

Certain functions of the smbpasswd(8) tool have been split between the
new smbpasswd(8) utility, the net(8) tool, and the new pdbedit(8)
utility.  See the respective man pages for details.

######################################################################
LDAP
####

This section outlines the new features affecting Samba / LDAP
integration.

New Schema
----------

A new object class (sambaSamAccount) has been introduced to replace
the old sambaAccount.  This change aids us in the renaming of
attributes to prevent clashes with attributes from other vendors.
There is a conversion script (examples/LDAP/convertSambaAccount) to
modify and LDIF file to the new schema.

Example:

  $ ldapsearch .... -b "ou=people,dc=..." &gt; sambaAcct.ldif
  $ convertSambaAccount --sid=&lt;Domain SID&gt; \
    --input=sambaAcct.ldif --output=sambaSamAcct.ldif \
    --changetype=[modify|add]

The &lt;DOM SID&gt; can be obtained by running 'net getlocalsid
&lt;DOMAINNAME&gt;' on the Samba PDC as root.  The changetype determines
the format of the generated LDIF output--either create new entries
or modify existing entries.

The old sambaAccount schema may still be used by specifying the
"ldapsam_compat" passdb backend.  However, the sambaAccount and
associated attributes have been moved to the historical section of
the schema file and must be uncommented before use if needed.
The 2.2 object class declaration for a sambaAccount has not changed
in the 3.0 samba.schema file.

Other new object classes and their uses include:

  * sambaDomain - domain information used to allocate rids
    for users and groups as necessary.  The attributes are added
    in 'ldap suffix' directory entry automatically if
    an idmap uid/gid range has been set and the 'ldapsam'
    passdb backend has been selected.

  * sambaGroupMapping - an object representing the
    relationship between a posixGroup and a Windows
    group/SID.  These entries are stored in the 'ldap
    group suffix' and managed by the 'net groupmap' command.

  * sambaUnixIdPool - created in the 'ldap idmap suffix' entry
    automatically and contains the next available 'idmap uid' and
    'idmap gid'

  * sambaIdmapEntry - object storing a mapping between a
    SID and a UNIX uid/gid.  These objects are created by the
    idmap_ldap module as needed.

  * sambaSidEntry - object representing a SID alone, as a Structural
    class on which to build the sambaIdmapEntry.


New Suffix for Searching
------------------------

The following new smb.conf parameters have been added to aid in directing
certain LDAP queries when 'passdb backend = ldapsam://...' has been
specified.

  * ldap suffix         - used to search for user and computer accounts
  * ldap user suffix    - used to store user accounts
  * ldap machine suffix - used to store machine trust accounts
  * ldap group suffix   - location of posixGroup/sambaGroupMapping entries
  * ldap idmap suffix   - location of sambaIdmapEntry objects

If an 'ldap suffix' is defined, it will be appended to all of the
remaining sub-suffix parameters.  In this case, the order of the suffix
listings in smb.conf is important.  Always place the 'ldap suffix' first
in the list.

Due to a limitation in Samba's smb.conf parsing, you should not surround
the DN's with quotation marks.

The key concern in this section is to deal with the changes that have been
affected in Samba-3 between the Samba-3.0.0 release and the current update.
Network administrators have expressed concerns over the steps that should be
taken to update Samba-3 versions.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id368197"></a>
The information in <a class="link" href="upgrades.html#sbeug1" title="Location of config files">&#8220;Location of config files&#8221;</a> would not be necessary if every
person who has ever produced Samba executable (binary) files could agree on
the preferred location of the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file and other Samba control files.
Clearly, such agreement is further away than a pipedream.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id368220"></a>
Vendors and packagers who produce Samba binary installable packages do not,
as a rule, use the default paths used by the Samba-Team for the location of
the binary files, the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file, and the Samba control files (tdb's
as well as files such as <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code>). This means that
the network or UNIX administrator who sets out to build the Samba executable
files from the Samba tarball must take particular care. Failure to take care
will result in both the original vendor's version of Samba remaining installed
and the new version being installed in the default location used
by the Samba-Team. This can lead to confusion and to much lost time as the
uninformed administrator deals with apparent failure of the update to take
effect.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id368248"></a>
The best advice for those lacking in code compilation experience is to use
only vendor (or Samba-Team) provided binary packages. The Samba packages
that are provided by the Samba-Team are generally built to use file paths
that are compatible with the original OS vendor's practices.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id368261"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id368268"></a>
If you are not sure whether a binary package complies with the OS
vendor's practices, it is better to ask the package maintainer via
email than to waste much time dealing with the nuances.
Alternately, just diagnose the paths specified by the binary files following
the procedure outlined above.

	is one that has been requested for several years and thus may be of interest
	at your site.
	</p><p>
	In Samba-3.0.11 there were some functional changes to the <em class="parameter"><code>ldap user

If "ldap user suffix" or "ldap machine suffix" are defined in

and all machine and inter-domain trust-accounts must be located
below the machine suffix.  Previous Samba releases would fall
back to searching the 'ldap suffix' in some cases.

	Replacement of a domain member server should be done
	using the same procedure as outlined in <a class="link" href="unixclients.html" title="Chapter 7. Adding Domain Member Servers and Clients">&#8220;Adding Domain Member Servers and Clients&#8221;</a>.
	</p><p>
	Usually the new server will be introduced with a temporary name. After
	the old server data has been migrated to the new server, it is customary
	that the new server be renamed to that of the old server. This will
	change its SID and will necessitate rejoining to the domain.

	Following a change of hostname (NetBIOS name) it is a good idea on all servers
	to shut down the Samba <code class="literal">smbd</code>, <code class="literal">nmbd</code>, and
	<code class="literal">winbindd</code> services, delete the <code class="filename">wins.dat</code>
	and <code class="filename">browse.dat</code> files, then restart Samba. This will ensure
	that the old name and IP address information is no longer able to interfere with
	name to IP address resolution.  If this is not done, there can be temporary name
	resolution problems. These problems usually clear within 45 minutes of a name
	change, but can persist for a longer period of time.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id368603"></a>
	If the old domain member server had local accounts, it is necessary to create
	on the new domain member server the same accounts with the same UID and GID
	for each account. Where the <em class="parameter"><code>passdb backend</code></em> database
	is stored in the <code class="constant">smbpasswd</code> or in the
	<code class="constant">tdbsam</code> format, the user and group account information
	for UNIX accounts that match the Samba accounts will reside in the system
	<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, <code class="filename">/etc/shadow</code>, and
	<code class="filename">/etc/group</code> files. In this case, be sure to copy these
	account entries to the new target server.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id368648"></a>
	Where the user accounts for both UNIX and Samba are stored in LDAP, the new
	target server must be configured to use the <code class="literal">nss_ldap</code> tool set.
	This will automatically ensure that the appropriate user entities are
	available on the new server.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id368672"></a>
	In the past, people who replaced a Windows NT4 domain controller typically
	installed a new server, created printers and file shares on it, then migrate across
	all data that was destined to reside on it. The same can of course be done with
	Samba.
	</p><p>
	From recent mailing list postings it would seem that some administrators
	have the intent to just replace the old Samba server with a new one with
	the same name as the old one. In this case, simply follow the same process
	as for upgrading a Samba 2.x system and do the following:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
		Where UNIX (POSIX) user and group accounts are stored in the system
		<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, <code class="filename">/etc/shadow</code>, and 
		<code class="filename">/etc/group</code> files, be sure to add the same accounts
		with identical UID and GID values for each user.
		</p><p>
		Where LDAP is used, if the new system is intended to be the LDAP server,
		migrate it across by configuring the LDAP server 
		(<code class="filename">/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</code>). The directory can
		be populated either initially by setting this LDAP server up as a slave or
		by dumping the data from the old LDAP server using the <code class="literal">slapcat</code>
		command and then reloading the same data into the new LDAP server using the
		<code class="literal">slapadd</code> command. Do not forget to install and configure
		the <code class="literal">nss_ldap</code> tool and the <code class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>
		(as shown in <a class="link" href="happy.html" title="Chapter 5. Making Happy Users">&#8220;Making Happy Users&#8221;</a>).
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		Copy the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file from the old server to the new server into the correct
		location as indicated previously in this chapter.
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		Copy the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file, the <code class="filename">smbpasswd</code>
		file (if it is used), the <code class="filename">/etc/samba/passdb.tdb</code> file (only
		used by the <code class="constant">tdbsam</code> backend), and all the tdb control files
		from the old system to the correct location on the new system.
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		Before starting the Samba daemons, verify that the hostname of the new server
		is identical to that of the old one. Note: The IP address can be different
		from that of the old server.
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		Copy all files from the old server to the new server, taking precaution to
		preserve all file ownership and permissions as well as any POSIX ACLs that
		may have been created on the old server.
		</p></li></ul></div><p>
	When replacing a Samba domain controller (PDC or BDC) that uses LDAP, the new server
	need simply be configured to use the LDAP directory, and for the rest it should just
	work. The domain SID is obtained from the LDAP directory as part of the first connect
	to the LDAP directory server.
	</p><p>
	All Samba servers, other than one that uses LDAP, depend on the tdb files, and
	particularly on the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file. So long as the tdb files are
	all in place, the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file is preserved, and either the hostname is identical
	or the <em class="parameter"><code>netbios name</code></em> is set to the original server name, Samba
	should correctly pick up the original SID and preserve all other settings. It is
	sound advice to validate this before turning the system over to users.

	Yes, it works. The Windows ADMT tool can be used to migrate Samba accounts
	to MS Active Directory.  There are a few pitfalls to be aware of:
	</p><div class="procedure" title="Procedure 8.2. Migration to Active Directory"><a name="id368853"></a><p class="title"><b>Procedure 8.2. Migration to Active Directory</b></p><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step" title="Step 1"><p>
		Administrator password must be THE SAME on the Samba server,
		the 2003 ADS, and the local Administrator account on the workstations. 
		Perhaps this goes without saying, but there needs to be an account
		called <code class="constant">Administrator</code> in your Samba domain, with 
		full administrative (root) rights to that domain.
		</p></li><li class="step" title="Step 2"><p>
		In the Advanced/DNS section of the TCP/IP settings on your Windows 
		workstations, make sure the <em class="parameter"><code>DNS suffix for this 
		connection</code></em> field is blank. 
		</p></li><li class="step" title="Step 3"><p>
		Because you are migrating from Samba, user passwords cannot be 
		migrated. You'll have to reset everyone's passwords. (If you were 
		migrating from NT4 to ADS, you could migrate passwords as well.)
		</p><p>
		To date this has not been attempted with roaming profile support;
		it has been documented as working with local profiles.
		</p></li><li class="step" title="Step 4"><p>
		Disable the Windows Firewall on all workstations. Otherwise, 
		workstations won't be migrated to the new domain.
		</p></li><li class="step" title="Step 5"><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id368911"></a>
		When migrating machines, always test first (using ADMT's test mode) 
		and satisfy all errors before committing the migration. Note that the 
		test will always fail, because the machine will not have been actually 
		migrated. You'll need to interpret the errors to know whether the 
		failure was due to a problem or simply to the fact that it was just 
		a test.
		</p></li></ol></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id368925"></a>
	There are some significant benefits of using the ADMT, besides just 
	migrating user accounts. ADMT can be found on the Windows 2003 CD.
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
		You can migrate workstations remotely. You can specify that SIDs 
		be simply added instead of replaced, giving you the option of joining a 
		workstation back to the old domain if something goes awry. The 
		workstations will be joined to the new domain.
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		Not only are user accounts migrated from the old domain to the new 
		domain, but ACLs on the workstations are migrated as well. Like SIDs, 
		ACLs can be added instead of replaced.
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		Locally stored user profiles on workstations are migrated as well, 
		presenting almost no disruption to the user. Saved passwords will be 
		lost, just as when you administratively reset the password in Windows ADS.
		</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		The ADMT lets you test all operations before actually performing the 
		migration. Accounts and workstations can be migrated individually or in 
		batches. User accounts can be safely migrated all at once (since no 
		changes are made on the original domain). It is recommended to migrate only one 
		or two workstations as a test before committing them all.
