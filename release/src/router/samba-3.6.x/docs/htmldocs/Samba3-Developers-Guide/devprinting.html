Samba uses a table of function pointers to seven functions.  The
function prototypes are defined in the <code class="varname">printif</code> structure declared
in <code class="filename">printing.h</code>.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>retrieve the contents of a print queue</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>pause the print queue</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>resume a paused print queue</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>delete a job from the queue</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>pause a job in the print queue</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>result a paused print job in the queue</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>submit a job to the print queue</p></li></ul></div><p>

Print Queue TDB's
</h2></div></div></div><p>
Samba provides periodic caching of the output from the "lpq command"
for performance reasons.  This cache time is configurable in seconds.
Obviously the longer the cache time the less often smbd will be
required to exec a copy of lpq.  However, the accuracy of the print
queue contents displayed to clients will be diminished as well.
</p><p>
The list of currently opened print queue TDB's can be found
be examining the list of tdb_print_db structures ( see print_db_head
in printing.c ). A queue TDB is opened using the wrapper function
printing.c:get_print_db_byname().  The function ensures that smbd
does not open more than MAX_PRINT_DBS_OPEN in an effort to prevent
a large print server from exhausting all available file descriptors.
If the number of open queue TDB's exceeds the MAX_PRINT_DBS_OPEN
limit, smbd falls back to a most recently used algorithm for maintaining
a list of open TDB's.
</p><p>
There are two ways in which a a print job can be entered into
a print queue's TDB.  The first is to submit the job from a Windows
client which will insert the job information directly into the TDB.
The second method is to have the print job picked up by executing the
"lpq command".
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/* included from printing.h */
struct printjob {
	pid_t pid; /* which process launched the job */
	int sysjob; /* the system (lp) job number */
	int fd; /* file descriptor of open file if open */
	time_t starttime; /* when the job started spooling */
	int status; /* the status of this job */
	size_t size; /* the size of the job so far */
	int page_count;	/* then number of pages so far */
	BOOL spooled; /* has it been sent to the spooler yet? */
	BOOL smbjob; /* set if the job is a SMB job */
	fstring filename; /* the filename used to spool the file */
	fstring jobname; /* the job name given to us by the client */
	fstring user; /* the user who started the job */
	fstring queuename; /* service number of printer for this job */
	NT_DEVICEMODE *nt_devmode;
};
</pre><p>
The current manifestation of the printjob structure contains a field
for the UNIX job id returned from the "lpq command" and a Windows job
ID (32-bit bounded by PRINT_MAX_JOBID).  When a print job is returned
by the "lpq command" that does not match an existing job in the queue's
TDB, a 32-bit job ID above the &lt;*vance doesn't know what word is missing here*&gt; is generating by adding UNIX_JOB_START to
the id reported by lpq.
</p><p>
In order to match a 32-bit Windows jobid onto a 16-bit lanman print job
id, smbd uses an in memory TDB to match the former to a number appropriate
for old lanman clients.
</p><p>
When updating a print queue, smbd will perform the following
steps ( refer to <code class="filename">print.c:print_queue_update()</code> ):
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Check to see if another smbd is currently in 
	the process of updating the queue contents by checking the pid 
	stored in <code class="constant">LOCK/<em class="replaceable"><code>printer_name</code></em></code>.  
	If so, then do not update the TDB.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Lock the mutex entry in the TDB and store our own pid.

     	{
		if the job is a UNIX job, create a new entry;
		if the job has a Windows based jobid, then
		{
			Lookup the record by the jobid;
			if the lookup failed, then
				treat it as a UNIX job;
			else
				update the job status only
		}
	}</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete any jobs in the TDB that are not
	in the in the lpq listing</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Store the print queue status in the TDB</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>update the cache time stamp again</p></li></ol></div><p>
Note that it is the contents of this TDB that is returned to Windows
clients and not the actual listing from the "lpq command".
</p><p>
The NT_DEVICEMODE stored as part of the printjob structure is used to
store a pointer to a non-default DeviceMode associated with the print
job.  The pointer will be non-null when the client included a Device
Mode in the OpenPrinterEx() call and subsequently submitted a job for
printing on that same handle.  If the client did not include a Device
Mode in the OpenPrinterEx() request, the nt_devmode field is NULL
and the job has the printer's device mode associated with it by default.
</p><p>
Only non-default Device Mode are stored with print jobs in the print
queue TDB.  Otherwise, the Device Mode is obtained from the printer
object when the client issues a GetJob(level == 2) request.

ChangeID and Client Caching of Printer Information

Windows NT/2K Printer Change Notify
</h2></div></div></div><p>
When working with Windows NT+ clients, it is possible for a
print server to use RPC to send asynchronous change notification
events to clients for certain printer and print job attributes.
This can be useful when the client needs to know that a new
job has been added to the queue for a given printer or that the
driver for a printer has been changed.  Note that this is done
entirely orthogonal to cache updates based on a new ChangeID for
a printer object.
</p><p>
The basic set of RPC's used to implement change notification are
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>RemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotifyEx ( RFFPCN )</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>RemoteFindNextPrinterChangeNotifyEx ( RFNPCN )</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>FindClosePrinterChangeNotify( FCPCN )</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ReplyOpenPrinter</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ReplyClosePrinter</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>RouteRefreshPrinterChangeNotify ( RRPCN )</p></li></ul></div><p>
One additional RPC is available to a server, but is never used by the
Windows spooler service:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>RouteReplyPrinter()</p></li></ul></div><p>
The opnum for all of these RPC's are defined in include/rpc_spoolss.h
</p><p>
Windows NT print servers use a bizarre method of sending print
notification event to clients.  The process of registering a new change
notification handle is as follows.  The 'C' is for client and the
'S' is for server.  All error conditions have been eliminated.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
C:	Obtain handle to printer or to the printer
	server via the standard OpenPrinterEx() call.
S:	Respond with a valid handle to object

C:	Send a RFFPCN request with the previously obtained
	handle with either (a) set of flags for change events
	to monitor, or (b) a PRINTER_NOTIFY_OPTIONS structure
	containing the event information to monitor.  The windows
	spooler has only been observed to use (b).
S:	The &lt;* another missing word*&gt; opens a new TCP session to the client (thus requiring
	all print clients to be CIFS servers as well) and sends
	a ReplyOpenPrinter() request to the client.
C:	The client responds with a printer handle that can be used to
	send event notification messages.
S:	The server replies success to the RFFPCN request.

C:	The windows spooler follows the RFFPCN with a RFNPCN
	request to fetch the current values of all monitored
	attributes.
S:	The server replies with an array SPOOL_NOTIFY_INFO_DATA
	structures (contained in a SPOOL_NOTIFY_INFO structure).

C:	If the change notification handle is ever released by the
	client via a FCPCN request, the server sends a ReplyClosePrinter()
	request back to the client first.  However a request of this
	nature from the client is often an indication that the previous
	notification event was not marshalled correctly by the server
	or a piece of data was wrong.
S:	The server closes the internal change notification handle
	(POLICY_HND) and does not send any further change notification
	events to the client for that printer or job.
</pre><p>
The current list of notification events supported by Samba can be
found by examining the internal tables in srv_spoolss_nt.c
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>printer_notify_table[]</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>job_notify_table[]</p></li></ul></div><p>
When an event occurs that could be monitored, smbd sends a message
to itself about the change.  The list of events to be transmitted
are queued by the smbd process sending the message to prevent an
overload of TDB usage and the internal message is sent during smbd's
idle loop (refer to printing/notify.c and the functions
send_spoolss_notify2_msg() and print_notify_send_messages() ).
</p><p>
The decision of whether or not the change is to be sent to connected
clients is made by the routine which actually sends the notification.
( refer to srv_spoolss_nt.c:recieve_notify2_message() ).
</p><p>
Because it possible to receive a listing of multiple changes for
multiple printers, the notification events must be split into
categories by the printer name.  This makes it possible to group
multiple change events to be sent in a single RPC according to the
printer handle obtained via a ReplyOpenPrinter().
</p><p>
The actual change notification is performed using the RRPCN request
RPC.  This packet contains
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>the printer handle registered with the
client's spooler on which the change occurred</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The change_low value which was sent as part
of the last RFNPCN request from the client</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The SPOOL_NOTIFY_INFO container with the event

The <code class="varname">SPOOL_NOTIFY_INFO_DATA</code> entries contain:
