	mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs. No database is required
	in this case as the mapping is deterministic.</p><p>
	Note that the idmap_rid module has changed considerably since Samba
	versions 3.0. and 3.2.
	Currently, there should to be an explicit idmap configuration for each
	domain that should use the idmap_rid backend, using disjoint ranges.
	One usually needs to define a writeable default idmap range, using
	a backent like <em class="parameter"><code>tdb</code></em> or <em class="parameter"><code>ldap</code></em>
	that can create unix ids, in order to be able to map the BUILTIN sids
	and other domains, and also in order to be able to create group mappings.
	See the example below.
	</p><p>
	Note that the old syntax
	<em class="parameter"><code>idmap backend = rid:"DOM1=range DOM2=range2 ..."</code></em>
	is not supported any more since Samba version 3.0.25.

			Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the
			backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter.
			If algorithmically determined UID or GID fall outside the
			range, they are ignored and the corresponding map is discarded.
			It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps
			between local and remotely defined IDs.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">base_rid = INTEGER</span></dt><dd><p>
			Defines the base integer used to build SIDs out of a UID or a GID,
			and to rebase the UID or GID to be obtained from a SID.
			This means SIDs with a RID less than the base rid are filtered.
			The default is not to restrict the allowed rids at all,
			i.e. a base_rid value of 0.
			A good value for the base_rid can be 1000, since user
			RIDs by default start at 1000 (512 hexadecimal).
		</p><p>
			Use of this parameter is deprecated.

		The Unix ID for a RID is calculated this way:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			ID = RID - BASE_RID + LOW_RANGE_ID.
		</pre><p>
	</p><p>
		Correspondingly, the formula for calculating the RID for a
		given Unix ID is this:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			RID = ID + BASE_RID - LOW_RANGE_ID.
		</pre><p>
	</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="EXAMPLES"><a name="id266889"></a><h2>EXAMPLES</h2><p>
		This example shows how to configure two domains with idmap_rid,
		the principal domain and a trusted domain, leaving the default
		id mapping scheme at tdb. The example also demonstrates the use
		of the base_rid parameter for the trusted domain.

	The original Samba software and related utilities
	were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
	by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar
	to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
