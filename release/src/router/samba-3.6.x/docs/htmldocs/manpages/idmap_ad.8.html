	id mappings from an AD server that uses RFC2307/SFU schema
	extensions. This module implements only the "idmap"
	API, and is READONLY. Mappings must be provided in advance
	by the administrator by adding the posixAccount/posixGroup
	classes and relative attribute/value pairs to the user and
	group objects in the AD.</p><p>
	Note that the idmap_ad module has changed considerably since
	Samba versions 3.0 and 3.2.
	Currently, the <em class="parameter"><code>ad</code></em> backend
	does not work as the the default idmap backend, but one has
	to configure it separately for each domain for which one wants
	to use it, using disjoint ranges. One usually needs to configure
	a writeable default idmap range, using for example the
	<em class="parameter"><code>tdb</code></em> or <em class="parameter"><code>ldap</code></em>
	backend, in order to be able to map the BUILTIN sids and
	possibly other trusted domains. The writeable default config
	is also needed in order to be able to create group mappings.
	This catch-all default idmap configuration should have a range
	that is disjoint from any explicitly configured domain with
	idmap backend <em class="parameter"><code>ad</code></em>. See the example below.

	The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings from our principal and
	trusted AD domains. If trusted domains are present id conflicts must be
	resolved beforehand, there is no
	guarantee on the order conflicting mappings would be resolved at this point.

	This example also shows how to leave a small non conflicting range for local
	id allocation that may be used in internal backends like BUILTIN.
