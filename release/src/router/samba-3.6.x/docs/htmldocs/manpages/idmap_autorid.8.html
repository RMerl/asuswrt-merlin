	mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs that is more deterministic
	than idmap_tdb and easier to configure than idmap_rid.</p><p>The module works similar to idmap_rid, but it automatically
	configures the range to be used for each domain, so there is no need
	to specify a specific range for each domain in the forest, the only
	configuration that is needed is the range of uid/gids that shall
	be used for user/group mappings and an optional size of the ranges
	to be used.</p><p>The mappings of which domain is mapped to which range is stored
	in autorid.tdb, thus you should backup this database regularly.</p><p>Due to the algorithm being used, it is the module that is
	most easy to use as it only requires a minimal configuration.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="IDMAP OPTIONS"><a name="id266352"></a><h2>IDMAP OPTIONS</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">rangesize = numberofidsperdomain</span></dt><dd><p>
			Defines the available number of uids/gids per domain. The
			minimum needed value is 2000. SIDs with RIDs larger than this
			value cannot be mapped, are ignored and the corresponding map
			is discarded. Choose this value carefully, as this should
			not be changed after the first ranges for domains have been
			defined, otherwise mappings between domains will get intermixed
			leading to unpredictable results. Please note that RIDs in Windows
			Domains usually start with 500 for builtin users and 1000
			for regular users. As the parameter cannot be changed later, please
			plan accordingly for your expected number of users in a domain
			with safety margins.
			</p><p>One range will be used for local users and groups.
			Thus the number of local users and groups that can be created is
			limited by this option as well. If you plan to create a large amount
			of local users or groups, you will need set this parameter accordingly.
			</p><p>The default value is 100000.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="refsect1" title="THE MAPPING FORMULAS"><a name="id266845"></a><h2>THE MAPPING FORMULAS</h2><p>
		The Unix ID for a RID is calculated this way:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			ID = IDMAP UID LOW VALUE + DOMAINRANGENUMBER * RANGESIZE + RID
		</pre><p>
	</p><p>
		Correspondingly, the formula for calculating the RID for a
		given Unix ID is this:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			RID = ID - IDMAP UID LOW VALUE - DOMAINRANGENUMBER * RANGESIZE
		</pre><p>

		This example shows how to configure idmap_autorid as default
		for all domains with a potentially large amount of users
		plus a specific configuration for a trusted domain
		that uses the SFU mapping scheme. Please note that idmap
		ranges and sfu ranges are not allowed to overlap.
