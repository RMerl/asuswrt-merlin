	functions, depending on whether it is run by the <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span> user 
	or not. When run as a normal user it allows the user to change 
	the password used for their SMB sessions on any machines that store 
	SMB passwords. </p><p>By default (when run with no arguments) it will attempt to 
	change the current user's SMB password on the local machine. This is 
	similar to the way the <code class="literal">passwd(1)</code> program works. <code class="literal">
	smbpasswd</code> differs from how the passwd program works 
	however in that it is not <span class="emphasis"><em>setuid root</em></span> but works in 
	a client-server mode and communicates with a 
	locally running <a class="citerefentry" href="smbd.8.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smbd</span>(8)</span></a>. As a consequence in order for this to 
	succeed the smbd daemon must be running on the local machine. On a 
	UNIX machine the encrypted SMB passwords are usually stored in 
	the <a class="citerefentry" href="smbpasswd.5.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">smbpasswd</span>(5)</span></a> file. </p><p>When run by an ordinary user with no options, smbpasswd 
	will prompt them for their old SMB password and then ask them 
	for their new password twice, to ensure that the new password
	was typed correctly. No passwords will be echoed on the screen 
	whilst being typed. If you have a blank SMB password (specified by 
	the string "NO PASSWORD" in the smbpasswd file) then just press 
	the &lt;Enter&gt; key when asked for your old password. </p><p>smbpasswd can also be used by a normal user to change their
	SMB password on remote machines, such as Windows NT Primary Domain 
	Controllers.   See the (<em class="parameter"><code>-r</code></em>) and <em class="parameter"><code>-U</code></em> options 
	below. </p><p>When run by root, smbpasswd allows new users to be added 
	and deleted in the smbpasswd file, as well as allows changes to 
	the attributes of the user in this file to be made. When run by root, <code class="literal">
	smbpasswd</code> accesses the local smbpasswd file 
	directly, thus enabling changes to be made even if smbd is not 
	running. </p></div><div class="refsect1" title="OPTIONS"><a name="id265836"></a><h2>OPTIONS</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">-a</span></dt><dd><p>
		This option specifies that the username following should be added to the local smbpasswd file, with the new
		password typed (type &lt;Enter&gt; for the old password). This option is ignored if the username following
		already exists in the smbpasswd file and it is treated like a regular change password command.  Note that the
		default passdb backends require the user to already exist in the system password file (usually
		<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>), else the request to add the user will fail.
		</p><p>This option is only available when running smbpasswd 
		as root. </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-c</span></dt><dd><p>

		is done all attempts to authenticate via SMB using this username 
		will fail. </p><p>If the smbpasswd file is in the 'old' format (pre-Samba 2.0

		critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. </p><p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log

		smbpasswd file. </p><p>Note that to allow users to logon to a Samba server once 
		the password has been set to "NO PASSWORD" in the smbpasswd

		server to contact to attempt the password change. This name is 
		resolved into an IP address using the standard name resolution 
		mechanism in all programs of the Samba suite. See the <em class="parameter"><code>-R 
		name resolve order</code></em> parameter for details on changing 
		this resolving mechanism. </p><p>The username whose password is changed is that of the 
		current UNIX logged on user. See the <em class="parameter"><code>-U username</code></em>
		parameter for details on changing the password for a different 
		username. </p><p>Note that if changing a Windows NT Domain password the
