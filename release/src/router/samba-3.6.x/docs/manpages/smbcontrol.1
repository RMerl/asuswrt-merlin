smbcontrol [destination] [message\-type] [parameter]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
smbcontrol
is a very small program, which sends messages to a
\fBsmbd\fR(8), a
\fBnmbd\fR(8), or a
\fBwinbindd\fR(8)
daemon running on the system\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-h|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print a summary of command line options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s|\-\-configfile <configuration file>
.RS 4
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server\-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See
smb\&.conf
for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i
.RS 4
Run interactively\&. Individual commands of the form destination message\-type parameters can be entered on STDIN\&. An empty command line or a "q" will quit the program\&.
.RE
.PP
destination
.RS 4
One of
\fInmbd\fR,
\fIsmbd\fR
or a process ID\&.
.sp
The
\fIall\fR
destination causes the message to "broadcast" to all running daemons including nmbd and winbind\&. This is a change for Samba 3\&.3, prior to this the parameter smbd used to do this\&.
.sp
The
\fIsmbd\fR
destination causes the message to be sent to the smbd daemon specified in the
smbd\&.pid
file\&.
.sp
The
\fInmbd\fR
destination causes the message to be sent to the nmbd daemon specified in the
nmbd\&.pid
file\&.
.sp
The
\fIwinbindd\fR
destination causes the message to be sent to the winbind daemon specified in the
winbindd\&.pid
file\&.
.sp
If a single process ID is given, the message is sent to only that process\&.
.RE
.PP
message\-type
.RS 4
Type of message to send\&. See the section
\fBMESSAGE\-TYPES\fR
for details\&.
.RE

any parameters required for the message\-type
.RE
.SH "MESSAGE-TYPES"
.PP

\fBsmbd\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
debug
.RS 4
Set debug level to the value specified by the parameter\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&. If this message is sent to either the smbd or winbindd daemons, the parent process will rebroadcast the message to all child processes changing the debug level in each one\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
