.SH "NAME"
lmhosts \- The Samba NetBIOS hosts file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
lmhosts
is the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
NetBIOS name to IP address mapping file\&.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
lmhosts
is the
\fISamba \fR
NetBIOS name to IP address mapping file\&. It is very similar to the
/etc/hosts
file format, except that the hostname component must correspond to the NetBIOS naming format\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
It is an ASCII file containing one line for NetBIOS name\&. The two fields on each line are separated from each other by white space\&. Any entry beginning with \*(Aq#\*(Aq is ignored\&. Each line in the lmhosts file contains the following information:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
IP Address \- in dotted decimal format\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
NetBIOS Name \- This name format is a maximum fifteen character host name, with an optional trailing \*(Aq#\*(Aq character followed by the NetBIOS name type as two hexadecimal digits\&.
.sp
If the trailing \*(Aq#\*(Aq is omitted then the given IP address will be returned for all names that match the given name, whatever the NetBIOS name type in the lookup\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
An example follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#
# Sample Samba lmhosts file\&.
#
192\&.9\&.200\&.1	TESTPC
192\&.9\&.200\&.20	NTSERVER#20
192\&.9\&.200\&.21	SAMBASERVER
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Contains three IP to NetBIOS name mappings\&. The first and third will be returned for any queries for the names "TESTPC" and "SAMBASERVER" respectively, whatever the type component of the NetBIOS name requested\&.
.PP
The second mapping will be returned only when the "0x20" name type for a name "NTSERVER" is queried\&. Any other name type will not be resolved\&.
.PP
The default location of the
lmhosts
file is in the same directory as the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
file\&.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
lmhosts is loaded from the configuration directory\&. This is usually
/etc/samba
or
/usr/local/samba/lib\&.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBsmbclient\fR(1),
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5), and
\fBsmbpasswd\fR(8)
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
