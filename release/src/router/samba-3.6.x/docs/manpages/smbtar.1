.SH "NAME"
smbtar \- shell script for backing up SMB/CIFS shares directly to UNIX tape drives
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
smbtar [\-r] [\-i] [\-a] [\-v] {\-s\ server} [\-p\ password] [\-x\ services] [\-X] [\-N\ filename] [\-b\ blocksize] [\-d\ directory] [\-l\ loglevel] [\-u\ user] [\-t\ tape] {filenames}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the

\fI$TAPE\fR
environmental variable; if not set, a file called
tar\&.out\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b blocksize
.RS 4
Blocking factor\&. Defaults to 20\&. See
tar(1)
for a fuller explanation\&.
.RE

\-N filename
.RS 4
Backup only files newer than filename\&. Could be used (for example) on a log file to implement incremental backups\&.
.RE
.PP

.PP
The
\fI$TAPE\fR
variable specifies the default tape device to write to\&. May be overridden with the \-t option\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
The
smbtar
script has different options from ordinary tar and from smbclient\*(Aqs tar command\&.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.PP
Sites that are more careful about security may not like the way the script handles PC passwords\&. Backup and restore work on entire shares; should work on file lists\&. smbtar works best with GNU tar and may not work well with other versions\&.

\fIDIAGNOSTICS\fR
section for the
\fBsmbclient\fR(1)
command\&.

\fBsmbclient\fR(1),
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP
Ricky Poulten
wrote the tar extension and this man page\&. The
smbtar
script was heavily rewritten and improved by
Martin Kraemer\&. Many thanks to everyone who suggested extensions, improvements, bug fixes, etc\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
