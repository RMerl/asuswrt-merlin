.SH "NAME"
nmblookup \- NetBIOS over TCP/IP client used to lookup NetBIOS names
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
nmblookup [\-M] [\-R] [\-S] [\-r] [\-A] [\-h] [\-B\ <broadcast\ address>] [\-U\ <unicast\ address>] [\-d\ <debug\ level>] [\-s\ <smb\ config\ file>] [\-i\ <NetBIOS\ scope>] [\-T] [\-f] {name}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
nmblookup
is used to query NetBIOS names and map them to IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP queries\&. The options allow the name queries to be directed at a particular IP broadcast area or to a particular machine\&. All queries are done over UDP\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-M
.RS 4
Searches for a master browser by looking up the NetBIOS name
\fIname\fR
with a type of
\fB0x1d\fR\&. If
\fI name\fR
is "\-" then it does a lookup on the special name
\fB__MSBROWSE__\fR\&. Please note that in order to use the name "\-", you need to make sure "\-" isn\*(Aqt parsed as an argument, e\&.g\&. use :
\fBnmblookup \-M \-\- \-\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-R
.RS 4
Set the recursion desired bit in the packet to do a recursive lookup\&. This is used when sending a name query to a machine running a WINS server and the user wishes to query the names in the WINS server\&. If this bit is unset the normal (broadcast responding) NetBIOS processing code on a machine is used instead\&. See RFC1001, RFC1002 for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S
.RS 4
Once the name query has returned an IP address then do a node status query as well\&. A node status query returns the NetBIOS names registered by a host\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP datagrams\&. The reason for this option is a bug in Windows 95 where it ignores the source port of the requesting packet and only replies to UDP port 137\&. Unfortunately, on most UNIX systems root privilege is needed to bind to this port, and in addition, if the
\fBnmbd\fR(8)
daemon is running on this machine it also binds to this port\&.
.RE
.PP
\-A
.RS 4
Interpret
\fIname\fR
as an IP Address and do a node status query on this address\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n|\-\-netbiosname <primary NetBIOS name>
.RS 4
This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself\&. This is identical to setting the
\m[blue]\fBnetbios name\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&. However, a command line setting will take precedence over settings in
smb\&.conf\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i|\-\-scope <scope>
.RS 4
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that
nmblookup
will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names\&. For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001\&.txt and rfc1002\&.txt\&. NetBIOS scopes are
\fIvery\fR
rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you communicate with\&.
.RE
.PP
\-W|\-\-workgroup=domain
.RS 4
Set the SMB domain of the username\&. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in smb\&.conf\&. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-O|\-\-socket\-options socket options
.RS 4
TCP socket options to set on the client socket\&. See the socket options parameter in the
smb\&.conf
manual page for the list of valid options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print a summary of command line options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-B <broadcast address>
.RS 4
Send the query to the given broadcast address\&. Without this option the default behavior of nmblookup is to send the query to the broadcast address of the network interfaces as either auto\-detected or defined in the
\fIinterfaces\fR
parameter of the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-U <unicast address>
.RS 4
Do a unicast query to the specified address or host
\fIunicast address\fR\&. This option (along with the
\fI\-R\fR
option) is needed to query a WINS server\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d|\-\-debuglevel=level
.RS 4
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 0\&.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day\-to\-day running \- it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\m[blue]\fBlog level\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V|\-\-version
.RS 4
Prints the program version number\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s|\-\-configfile <configuration file>
.RS 4
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server\-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See
smb\&.conf
for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l|\-\-log\-basename=logdirectory
.RS 4
Base directory name for log/debug files\&. The extension
\fB"\&.progname"\fR
will be appended (e\&.g\&. log\&.smbclient, log\&.smbd, etc\&.\&.\&.)\&. The log file is never removed by the client\&.
.RE
.PP
\-T
.RS 4
This causes any IP addresses found in the lookup to be looked up via a reverse DNS lookup into a DNS name, and printed out before each
.sp
\fIIP address \&.\&.\&.\&. NetBIOS name\fR
.sp
pair that is the normal output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f
.RS 4
Show which flags apply to the name that has been looked up\&. Possible answers are zero or more of: Response, Authoritative, Truncated, Recursion_Desired, Recursion_Available, Broadcast\&.
.RE
.PP
name
.RS 4
This is the NetBIOS name being queried\&. Depending upon the previous options this may be a NetBIOS name or IP address\&. If a NetBIOS name then the different name types may be specified by appending \*(Aq#<type>\*(Aq to the name\&. This name may also be \*(Aq*\*(Aq, which will return all registered names within a broadcast area\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
nmblookup
can be used to query a WINS server (in the same way
nslookup
is used to query DNS servers)\&. To query a WINS server,
nmblookup
must be called like this:
.PP
nmblookup \-U server \-R \*(Aqname\*(Aq
.PP
For example, running :
.PP
nmblookup \-U samba\&.org \-R \*(AqIRIX#1B\*(Aq
.PP
would query the WINS server samba\&.org for the domain master browser (1B name type) for the IRIX workgroup\&.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBnmbd\fR(8),
\fBsamba\fR(7), and
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
