.SH "NAME"
net \- Tool for administration of Samba and remote CIFS servers\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
net {<ads|rap|rpc>} [\-h] [\-w\ workgroup] [\-W\ myworkgroup] [\-U\ user] [\-I\ ip\-address] [\-p\ port] [\-n\ myname] [\-s\ conffile] [\-S\ server] [\-l] [\-P] [\-d\ debuglevel] [\-V] [\-\-request\-timeout\ seconds]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
The Samba net utility is meant to work just like the net utility available for windows and DOS\&. The first argument should be used to specify the protocol to use when executing a certain command\&. ADS is used for ActiveDirectory, RAP is using for old (Win9x/NT3) clients and RPC can be used for NT4 and Windows 2000\&. If this argument is omitted, net will try to determine it automatically\&. Not all commands are available on all protocols\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-h|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print a summary of command line options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k|\-\-kerberos
.RS 4
Try to authenticate with kerberos\&. Only useful in an Active Directory environment\&.
.RE
.PP
\-w target\-workgroup
.RS 4
Sets target workgroup or domain\&. You have to specify either this option or the IP address or the name of a server\&.
.RE
.PP
\-W workgroup
.RS 4
Sets client workgroup or domain
.RE
.PP
\-U user
.RS 4
User name to use
.RE
.PP
\-I ip\-address
.RS 4
IP address of target server to use\&. You have to specify either this option or a target workgroup or a target server\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p port
.RS 4
Port on the target server to connect to (usually 139 or 445)\&. Defaults to trying 445 first, then 139\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n|\-\-netbiosname <primary NetBIOS name>
.RS 4
This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself\&. This is identical to setting the
\m[blue]\fBnetbios name\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&. However, a command line setting will take precedence over settings in
smb\&.conf\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s|\-\-configfile <configuration file>
.RS 4
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server\-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See
smb\&.conf
for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S server
.RS 4
Name of target server\&. You should specify either this option or a target workgroup or a target IP address\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l
.RS 4
When listing data, give more information on each item\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P
.RS 4
Make queries to the external server using the machine account of the local server\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-request\-timeout 30
.RS 4
Let client requests timeout after 30 seconds the default is 10 seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d|\-\-debuglevel=level
.RS 4
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 0\&.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day\-to\-day running \- it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\m[blue]\fBlog level\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&.
.RE
.SH "COMMANDS"
.SS "CHANGESECRETPW"
.PP
This command allows the Samba machine account password to be set from an external application to a machine account password that has already been stored in Active Directory\&. DO NOT USE this command unless you know exactly what you are doing\&. The use of this command requires that the force flag (\-f) be used also\&. There will be NO command prompt\&. Whatever information is piped into stdin, either by typing at the command line or otherwise, will be stored as the literal machine password\&. Do NOT use this without care and attention as it will overwrite a legitimate machine password without warning\&. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\&.
.SS "TIME"
.PP
The
NET TIME
command allows you to view the time on a remote server or synchronise the time on the local server with the time on the remote server\&.

.SS "USERSHARE"
.PP
Starting with version 3\&.0\&.23, a Samba server now supports the ability for non\-root users to add user defined shares to be exported using the "net usershare" commands\&.
.PP
To set this up, first set up your smb\&.conf by adding to the [global] section: usershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares Next create the directory /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares, change the owner to root and set the group owner to the UNIX group who should have the ability to create usershares, for example a group called "serverops"\&. Set the permissions on /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares to 01770\&. (Owner and group all access, no access for others, plus the sticky bit, which means that a file in that directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the file)\&. Finally, tell smbd how many usershares you will allow by adding to the [global] section of smb\&.conf a line such as : usershare max shares = 100\&. To allow 100 usershare definitions\&. Now, members of the UNIX group "serverops" can create user defined shares on demand using the commands below\&.
.PP
The usershare commands are:
.RS 4
net usershare add sharename path [comment [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]] \- to add or change a user defined share\&.
.RE
.RS 4
net usershare delete sharename \- to delete a user defined share\&.
.RE
.RS 4
net usershare info [\-l|\-\-long] [wildcard sharename] \- to print info about a user defined share\&.
.RE
.RS 4
net usershare list [\-l|\-\-long] [wildcard sharename] \- to list user defined shares\&.
.RE
.SS "USERSHARE ADD sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]"
.PP
Add or replace a new user defined share, with name "sharename"\&.
.PP
"path" specifies the absolute pathname on the system to be exported\&. Restrictions may be put on this, see the global smb\&.conf parameters: "usershare owner only", "usershare prefix allow list", and "usershare prefix deny list"\&.
.PP
The optional "comment" parameter is the comment that will appear on the share when browsed to by a client\&.
.PP
The optional "acl" field specifies which users have read and write access to the entire share\&. Note that guest connections are not allowed unless the smb\&.conf parameter "usershare allow guests" has been set\&. The definition of a user defined share acl is: "user:permission", where user is a valid username on the system and permission can be "F", "R", or "D"\&. "F" stands for "full permissions", ie\&. read and write permissions\&. "D" stands for "deny" for a user, ie\&. prevent this user from accessing this share\&. "R" stands for "read only", ie\&. only allow read access to this share (no creation of new files or directories or writing to files)\&.
.PP
The default if no "acl" is given is "Everyone:R", which means any authenticated user has read\-only access\&.
.PP
The optional "guest_ok" has the same effect as the parameter of the same name in smb\&.conf, in that it allows guest access to this user defined share\&. This parameter is only allowed if the global parameter "usershare allow guests" has been set to true in the smb\&.conf\&.


There is no separate command to modify an existing user defined share,
just use the "net usershare add [sharename]" command using the same
sharename as the one you wish to modify and specify the new options
you wish\&. The Samba smbd daemon notices user defined share modifications
at connect time so will see the change immediately, there is no need
to restart smbd on adding, deleting or changing a user defined share\&.
.SS "USERSHARE DELETE sharename"
.PP
Deletes the user defined share by name\&. The Samba smbd daemon immediately notices this change, although it will not disconnect any users currently connected to the deleted share\&.
.SS "USERSHARE INFO [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename]"
.PP
Get info on user defined shares owned by the current user matching the given pattern, or all users\&.
.PP
net usershare info on its own dumps out info on the user defined shares that were created by the current user, or restricts them to share names that match the given wildcard pattern (\*(Aq*\*(Aq matches one or more characters, \*(Aq?\*(Aq matches only one character)\&. If the \*(Aq\-l\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\-long\*(Aq option is also given, it prints out info on user defined shares created by other users\&.
.PP
The information given about a share looks like: [foobar] path=/home/jeremy comment=testme usershare_acl=Everyone:F guest_ok=n And is a list of the current settings of the user defined share that can be modified by the "net usershare add" command\&.
.SS "USERSHARE LIST [-l|--long] wildcard sharename"
.PP
List all the user defined shares owned by the current user matching the given pattern, or all users\&.
.PP
net usershare list on its own list out the names of the user defined shares that were created by the current user, or restricts the list to share names that match the given wildcard pattern (\*(Aq*\*(Aq matches one or more characters, \*(Aq?\*(Aq matches only one character)\&. If the \*(Aq\-l\*(Aq or \*(Aq\-\-long\*(Aq option is also given, it includes the names of user defined shares created by other users\&.
.SS "CONF"
.PP
Starting with version 3\&.2\&.0, a Samba server can be configured by data stored in registry\&. This configuration data can be edited with the new "net conf" commands\&.
.PP
The deployment of this configuration data can be activated in two levels from the
\fIsmb\&.conf\fR
file: Share definitions from registry are activated by setting
\fIregistry shares\fR
to
\(lqyes\(rq
in the [global] section and global configuration options are activated by setting
\m[blue]\fBinclude = registry\fR\m[]
in the [global] section for a mixed configuration or by setting
\m[blue]\fBconfig backend = registry\fR\m[]
in the [global] section for a registry\-only configuration\&. See the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
manpage for details\&.

.SS "CONF IMPORT [--test|-T] filename [section]"
.PP
This command imports configuration from a file in smb\&.conf format\&. If a section encountered in the input file is present in registry, its contents is replaced\&. Sections of registry configuration that have no counterpart in the input file are not affected\&. If you want to delete these, you will have to use the "net conf drop" or "net conf delshare" commands\&. Optionally, a section may be specified to restrict the effect of the import command to that specific section\&. A test mode is enabled by specifying the parameter "\-T" on the commandline\&. In test mode, no changes are made to the registry, and the resulting configuration is printed to standard output instead\&.

be "global"\&. Optionally, values for the very common options "writeable", "guest ok" and a "comment" may be specified\&. The same result may be obtained by a sequence of "net conf setparm" commands\&.
.SS "CONF DELSHARE sharename"
.PP

.SS "CONF DELPARM section parameter"
.PP
Delete a parameter stored in registry\&.
.SS "CONF GETINCLUDES section"
.PP
Get the list of includes for the provided section (global or share)\&.
.PP
Note that due to the nature of the registry database and the nature of include directives, the includes need special treatment: Parameters are stored in registry by the parameter name as valuename, so there is only ever one instance of a parameter per share\&. Also, a specific order like in a text file is not guaranteed\&. For all real parameters, this is perfectly ok, but the include directive is rather a meta parameter, for which, in the smb\&.conf text file, the place where it is specified between the other parameters is very important\&. This can not be achieved by the simple registry smbconf data model, so there is one ordered list of includes per share, and this list is evaluated after all the parameters of the share\&.
.PP
Further note that currently, only files can be included from registry configuration\&. In the future, there will be the ability to include configuration data from other registry keys\&.
.SS "CONF SETINCLUDES section [filename]+"
.PP
Set the list of includes for the provided section (global or share) to the given list of one or more filenames\&. The filenames may contain the usual smb\&.conf macros like %I\&.
