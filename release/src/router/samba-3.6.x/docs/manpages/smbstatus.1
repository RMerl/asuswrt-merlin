.SH "NAME"
smbstatus \- report on current Samba connections
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
smbstatus [\-P] [\-b] [\-d\ <debug\ level>] [\-v] [\-L] [\-B] [\-p] [\-S] [\-s\ <configuration\ file>] [\-u\ <username>]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
smbstatus
is a very simple program to list the current Samba connections\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-P|\-\-profile
.RS 4
If samba has been compiled with the profiling option, print only the contents of the profiling shared memory area\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b|\-\-brief
.RS 4
gives brief output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d|\-\-debuglevel=level
.RS 4
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 0\&.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day\-to\-day running \- it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\m[blue]\fBlog level\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V|\-\-version
.RS 4
Prints the program version number\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s|\-\-configfile <configuration file>
.RS 4
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server\-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See
smb\&.conf
for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l|\-\-log\-basename=logdirectory
.RS 4
Base directory name for log/debug files\&. The extension
\fB"\&.progname"\fR
will be appended (e\&.g\&. log\&.smbclient, log\&.smbd, etc\&.\&.\&.)\&. The log file is never removed by the client\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v|\-\-verbose
.RS 4
gives verbose output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L|\-\-locks
.RS 4
causes smbstatus to only list locks\&.
.RE
.PP
\-B|\-\-byterange
.RS 4
causes smbstatus to include byte range locks\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p|\-\-processes
.RS 4
print a list of
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
processes and exit\&. Useful for scripting\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S|\-\-shares
.RS 4
causes smbstatus to only list shares\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print a summary of command line options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u|\-\-user=<username>
.RS 4
selects information relevant to
\fIusername\fR
only\&.
.RE
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
and
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
