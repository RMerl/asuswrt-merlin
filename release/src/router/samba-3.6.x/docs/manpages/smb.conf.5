.SH "NAME"
smb.conf \- The configuration file for the Samba suite
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
The
smb\&.conf
file is a configuration file for the Samba suite\&.
smb\&.conf
contains runtime configuration information for the Samba programs\&. The
smb\&.conf
file is designed to be configured and administered by the
\fBswat\fR(8)
program\&. The complete description of the file format and possible parameters held within are here for reference purposes\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of sections and parameters\&. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\&. Sections contain parameters of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fIname\fR = \fIvalue \fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The file is line\-based \- that is, each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter\&.
.PP
Section and parameter names are not case sensitive\&.
.PP
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant\&. Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded\&. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant\&. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded\&. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim\&.
.PP
Any line beginning with a semicolon (\(lq;\(rq) or a hash (\(lq#\(rq) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace\&.
.PP
Any line ending in a
\(lq\e\(rq
is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion\&.
.PP
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 1/0 or true/false\&. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values\&. Some items such as create masks are numeric\&.
.SH "SECTION DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP
Each section in the configuration file (except for the [global] section) describes a shared resource (known as a
\(lqshare\(rq)\&. The section name is the name of the shared resource and the parameters within the section define the shares attributes\&.
.PP
There are three special sections, [global], [homes] and [printers], which are described under
\fIspecial sections\fR\&. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions\&.
.PP
A share consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of the service\&. Some housekeeping options are also specifiable\&.
.PP
Sections are either file share services (used by the client as an extension of their native file systems) or printable services (used by the client to access print services on the host running the server)\&.
.PP
Sections may be designated
\fIguest\fR
services, in which case no password is required to access them\&. A specified UNIX
\fIguest account\fR
is used to define access privileges in this case\&.
.PP
Sections other than guest services will require a password to access them\&. The client provides the username\&. As older clients only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list of usernames to check against the password using the
user =
option in the share definition\&. For modern clients such as Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary\&.
.PP
The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host system\&. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants\&.
.PP
The following sample section defines a file space share\&. The user has write access to the path
/home/bar\&. The share is accessed via the share name
foo:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
	\fI[foo]\fR
	\m[blue]\fBpath = /home/bar\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBread only = no\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The following sample section defines a printable share\&. The share is read\-only, but printable\&. That is, the only write access permitted is via calls to open, write to and close a spool file\&. The
\fIguest ok\fR
parameter means access will be permitted as the default guest user (specified elsewhere):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
	\fI[aprinter]\fR
	\m[blue]\fBpath = /usr/spool/public\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBread only = yes\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBprintable = yes\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBguest ok = yes\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "SPECIAL SECTIONS"
.SS "The [global] section"
.PP
Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole, or are defaults for sections that do not specifically define certain items\&. See the notes under PARAMETERS for more information\&.
.SS "The [homes] section"
.PP
If a section called [homes] is included in the configuration file, services connecting clients to their home directories can be created on the fly by the server\&.
.PP
When the connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned\&. If a match is found, it is used\&. If no match is found, the requested section name is treated as a username and looked up in the local password file\&. If the name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is created by cloning the [homes] section\&.
.PP
Some modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The share name is changed from homes to the located username\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If no path was given, the path is set to the user\*(Aqs home directory\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
If you decide to use a
\fIpath =\fR
line in your [homes] section, it may be useful to use the %S macro\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBpath = /data/pchome/%S\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
is useful if you have different home directories for your PCs than for UNIX access\&.
.PP
This is a fast and simple way to give a large number of clients access to their home directories with a minimum of fuss\&.
.PP
A similar process occurs if the requested section name is
\(lqhomes\(rq, except that the share name is not changed to that of the requesting user\&. This method of using the [homes] section works well if different users share a client PC\&.
.PP
The [homes] section can specify all the parameters a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense than others\&. The following is a typical and suitable [homes] section:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fI[homes]\fR
\m[blue]\fBread only = no\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
An important point is that if guest access is specified in the [homes] section, all home directories will be visible to all clients
\fIwithout a password\fR\&. In the very unlikely event that this is actually desirable, it is wise to also specify
\fIread only access\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fIbrowseable\fR
flag for auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable flag, not the [homes] browseable flag\&. This is useful as it means setting
\fIbrowseable = no\fR
in the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make any auto home directories visible\&.
.SS "The [printers] section"
.PP
This section works like [homes], but for printers\&.
.PP
If a [printers] section occurs in the configuration file, users are able to connect to any printer specified in the local host\*(Aqs printcap file\&.
.PP
When a connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned\&. If a match is found, it is used\&. If no match is found, but a [homes] section exists, it is used as described above\&. Otherwise, the requested section name is treated as a printer name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see if the requested section name is a valid printer share name\&. If a match is found, a new printer share is created by cloning the [printers] section\&.
.PP
A few modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The share name is set to the located printer name
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If no printer name was given, the printer name is set to the located printer name
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the share does not permit guest access and no username was given, the username is set to the located printer name\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
The [printers] service MUST be printable \- if you specify otherwise, the server will refuse to load the configuration file\&.
.PP
Typically the path specified is that of a world\-writeable spool directory with the sticky bit set on it\&. A typical [printers] entry looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fI[printers]\fR
\m[blue]\fBpath = /usr/spool/public\fR\m[]
\m[blue]\fBguest ok = yes\fR\m[]
\m[blue]\fBprintable = yes\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file are legitimate printer names as far as the server is concerned\&. If your printing subsystem doesn\*(Aqt work like that, you will have to set up a pseudo\-printcap\&. This is a file consisting of one or more lines like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
alias|alias|alias|alias\&.\&.\&.    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for your printing subsystem\&. In the [global] section, specify the new file as your printcap\&. The server will only recognize names found in your pseudo\-printcap, which of course can contain whatever aliases you like\&. The same technique could be used simply to limit access to a subset of your local printers\&.
.PP
An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the first entry of a printcap record\&. Records are separated by newlines, components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical bar symbols (|)\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP
On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what printers are defined on the system you may be able to use
printcap name = lpstat
to automatically obtain a list of printers\&. See the
printcap name
option for more details\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.SH "USERSHARES"
.PP
Starting with Samba version 3\&.0\&.23 the capability for non\-root users to add, modify, and delete their own share definitions has been added\&. This capability is called
\fIusershares\fR
and is controlled by a set of parameters in the [global] section of the smb\&.conf\&. The relevant parameters are :
.PP
usershare allow guests
.RS 4
Controls if usershares can permit guest access\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare max shares
.RS 4
Maximum number of user defined shares allowed\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare owner only
.RS 4
If set only directories owned by the sharing user can be shared\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare path
.RS 4
Points to the directory containing the user defined share definitions\&. The filesystem permissions on this directory control who can create user defined shares\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare prefix allow list
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of absolute pathnames restricting what directories can be shared\&. Only directories below the pathnames in this list are permitted\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare prefix deny list
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of absolute pathnames restricting what directories can be shared\&. Directories below the pathnames in this list are prohibited\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare template share
.RS 4
Names a pre\-existing share used as a template for creating new usershares\&. All other share parameters not specified in the user defined share definition are copied from this named share\&.
.RE
.PP
To allow members of the UNIX group
foo
to create user defined shares, create the directory to contain the share definitions as follows:
.PP
Become root:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
mkdir /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chgrp foo /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chmod 1770 /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares

.RE
.PP
net usershare info wildcard\-sharename
.RS 4

.RE
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
Parameters define the specific attributes of sections\&.
.PP
Some parameters are specific to the [global] section (e\&.g\&.,
\fIsecurity\fR)\&. Some parameters are usable in all sections (e\&.g\&.,
\fIcreate mask\fR)\&. All others are permissible only in normal sections\&. For the purposes of the following descriptions the [homes] and [printers] sections will be considered normal\&. The letter
\fIG\fR
in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the [global] section\&. The letter
\fIS\fR
indicates that a parameter can be specified in a service specific section\&. All
\fIS\fR
parameters can also be specified in the [global] section \- in which case they will define the default behavior for all services\&.
.PP
Parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order \- this may not create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where there are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer to the preferred synonym\&.
.SH "VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS"
.PP
Many of the strings that are settable in the config file can take substitutions\&. For example the option
\(lqpath = /tmp/%u\(rq
is interpreted as
\(lqpath = /tmp/john\(rq
if the user connected with the username john\&.
.PP
These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, but there are some general substitutions which apply whenever they might be relevant\&. These are:
.PP
%U
.RS 4
session username (the username that the client wanted, not necessarily the same as the one they got)\&.
.RE
.PP
%G
.RS 4
primary group name of %U\&.
.RE
.PP
%h
.RS 4
the Internet hostname that Samba is running on\&.
.RE
.PP
%m
.RS 4
the NetBIOS name of the client machine (very useful)\&.
.sp
This parameter is not available when Samba listens on port 445, as clients no longer send this information\&. If you use this macro in an include statement on a domain that has a Samba domain controller be sure to set in the [global] section
\fIsmb ports = 139\fR\&. This will cause Samba to not listen on port 445 and will permit include functionality to function as it did with Samba 2\&.x\&.
.RE
.PP

.SH "NAME MANGLING"
.PP
Samba supports
name mangling
so that DOS and Windows clients can use files that don\*(Aqt conform to the 8\&.3 format\&. It can also be set to adjust the case of 8\&.3 format filenames\&.
.PP
There are several options that control the way mangling is performed, and they are grouped here rather than listed separately\&. For the defaults look at the output of the testparm program\&.
.PP
These options can be set separately for each service\&.
.PP
The options are:
.PP
case sensitive = yes/no/auto
.RS 4
controls whether filenames are case sensitive\&. If they aren\*(Aqt, Samba must do a filename search and match on passed names\&. The default setting of auto allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS and smbclient 3\&.0\&.5 and above currently) to tell the Samba server on a per\-packet basis that they wish to access the file system in a case\-sensitive manner (to support UNIX case sensitive semantics)\&. No Windows or DOS system supports case\-sensitive filename so setting this option to auto is that same as setting it to no for them\&. Default
\fIauto\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
default case = upper/lower
.RS 4
controls what the default case is for new filenames (ie\&. files that don\*(Aqt currently exist in the filesystem)\&. Default
\fIlower\fR\&. IMPORTANT NOTE: As part of the optimizations for directories containing large numbers of files, the following special case applies\&. If the options
\m[blue]\fBcase sensitive = yes\fR\m[],
\m[blue]\fBpreserve case = No\fR\m[], and
\m[blue]\fBshort preserve case = No\fR\m[]
are set, then the case of
\fIall\fR
incoming client filenames, not just new filenames, will be modified\&. See additional notes below\&.
.RE
.PP
preserve case = yes/no
.RS 4
controls whether new files (ie\&. files that don\*(Aqt currently exist in the filesystem) are created with the case that the client passes, or if they are forced to be the
default
case\&. Default
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
short preserve case = yes/no
.RS 4
controls if new files (ie\&. files that don\*(Aqt currently exist in the filesystem) which conform to 8\&.3 syntax, that is all in upper case and of suitable length, are created upper case, or if they are forced to be the
default
case\&. This option can be used with
preserve case = yes
to permit long filenames to retain their case, while short names are lowercased\&. Default
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
By default, Samba 3\&.0 has the same semantics as a Windows NT server, in that it is case insensitive but case preserving\&. As a special case for directories with large numbers of files, if the case options are set as follows, "case sensitive = yes", "case preserve = no", "short preserve case = no" then the "default case" option will be applied and will modify all filenames sent from the client when accessing this share\&.
.SH "NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION"

This boolean parameter controls what

If a Windows client doesn\*(Aqt have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time\&. POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory\&. As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file\&. With this parameter set to true (the default) then smbd checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it\&. This is not perfect, as it\*(Aqs possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly, but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour\&.

in a slightly different ways\&.
.sp
For name service it causes
nmbd

nmbd
also binds to the "all addresses" interface (0\&.0\&.0\&.0) on ports 137 and 138 for the purposes of reading broadcast messages\&. If this option is not set then
nmbd
will service name requests on all of these sockets\&. If

is set then
nmbd
will check the source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast sockets and discard any that don\*(Aqt match the broadcast addresses of the interfaces in the
\m[blue]\fBinterfaces\fR\m[]
parameter list\&. As unicast packets are received on the other sockets it allows
nmbd
to refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive through any interfaces not listed in the
\m[blue]\fBinterfaces\fR\m[]
list\&. IP Source address spoofing does defeat this simple check, however, so it must not be used seriously as a security feature for
nmbd\&.
.sp
For file service it causes
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
to bind only to the interface list given in the
\m[blue]\fBinterfaces\fR\m[]
parameter\&. This restricts the networks that
smbd
will serve, to packets coming in on those interfaces\&. Note that you should not use this parameter for machines that are serving PPP or other intermittent or non\-broadcast network interfaces as it will not cope with non\-permanent interfaces\&.

In a cluster environment using Samba and ctdb it is critical that locks on central ctdb\-hosted databases like locking\&.tdb are not held for long\&. With the current Samba architecture it happens that Samba takes a lock and while holding that lock makes file system calls into the shared cluster file system\&. This option makes Samba warn if it detects that it has held locks for the specified number of milliseconds\&. If this happens,

When something in the cluster blocks, it can happen that we wait indefinitely long for ctdb, just adding to the blocking condition\&. In a well\-running cluster this should never happen, but there are too many components in a cluster that might have hickups\&. Choosing the right balance for this value is very tricky, because on a busy cluster long service times to transfer something across the cluster might be valid\&. Setting it too short will degrade the service your cluster presents, setting it too long might make the cluster itself not recover from something severely broken for too long\&.

Be aware that if you set this parameter, this needs to be in the file smb\&.conf, it is not really helpful to put this into a registry configuration (typical on a cluster), because to access the registry contact to ctdb is requred\&.

NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create time for all files and directories\&.

Setting this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 1\-1\-1980 as the create time for directories\&.

This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares\&. Visual C++ generated makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object file, and a make rule to create the directory\&. Also, when NMAKE compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a directory\&. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier timestamp than the object files it contains\&.

However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or or deleted in the directory\&. NMAKE finds all object files in the object directory\&. The timestamp of the last one built is then compared to the timestamp of the object directory\&.

When printing from Windows NT (or later), each printer in
smb\&.conf
has two associated names which can be used by the client\&. The first is the sharename (or shortname) defined in smb\&.conf\&. This is the only printername available for use by Windows 9x clients\&. The second name associated with a printer can be seen when browsing to the "Printers" (or "Printers and Faxes") folder on the Samba server\&. This is referred to simply as the printername (not to be confused with the
\fIprinter name\fR
option)\&.
.sp
When assigning a new driver to a printer on a remote Windows compatible print server such as Samba, the Windows client will rename the printer to match the driver name just uploaded\&. This can result in confusion for users when multiple printers are bound to the same driver\&. To prevent Samba from allowing the printer\*(Aqs printername to differ from the sharename defined in smb\&.conf, set
\fIforce printername = yes\fR\&.
.sp
Be aware that enabling this parameter may affect migrating printers from a Windows server to Samba since Windows has no way to force the sharename and printername to match\&.
.sp
It is recommended that this parameter\*(Aqs value not be changed once the printer is in use by clients as this could cause a user not be able to delete printer connections from their local Printers folder\&.

.\" force security mode
.PP
.RS 4
This parameter controls what UNIX permission bits can be modified when a Windows NT client is manipulating the UNIX permission on a file using the native NT security dialog box\&.
.sp
This parameter is applied as a mask (OR\*(Aqed with) to the changed permission bits, thus forcing any bits in this mask that the user may have modified to be on\&. Make sure not to mix up this parameter with
\m[blue]\fBsecurity mask\fR\m[], which works similar like this one but uses logical AND instead of OR\&.
.sp
Essentially, one bits in this mask may be treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security on a file, the user has always set to be on\&.
.sp
If not set explicitly this parameter is set to 0, and allows a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a file, with no restrictions\&.
.sp
\fI Note\fR
that users who can access the Samba server through other means can easily bypass this restriction, so it is primarily useful for standalone "appliance" systems\&. Administrators of most normal systems will probably want to leave this set to 0000\&.

.\" force unknown acl user
.PP
.RS 4
If this parameter is set, a Windows NT ACL that contains an unknown SID (security descriptor, or representation of a user or group id) as the owner or group owner of the file will be silently mapped into the current UNIX uid or gid of the currently connected user\&.
.sp
This is designed to allow Windows NT clients to copy files and folders containing ACLs that were created locally on the client machine and contain users local to that machine only (no domain users) to be copied to a Samba server (usually with XCOPY /O) and have the unknown userid and groupid of the file owner map to the current connected user\&. This can only be fixed correctly when winbindd allows arbitrary mapping from any Windows NT SID to a UNIX uid or gid\&.

This specifies a UNIX user name that will be assigned as the default user for all users connecting to this service\&. This is useful for sharing files\&. You should also use it carefully as using it incorrectly can cause security problems\&.
.sp
This user name only gets used once a connection is established\&. Thus clients still need to connect as a valid user and supply a valid password\&. Once connected, all file operations will be performed as the "forced user", no matter what username the client connected as\&. This can be very useful\&.
.sp
In Samba 2\&.0\&.5 and above this parameter also causes the primary group of the forced user to be used as the primary group for all file activity\&. Prior to 2\&.0\&.5 the primary group was left as the primary group of the connecting user (this was a bug)\&.

ID mapping in Samba is the mapping between Windows SIDs and Unix user and group IDs\&. This is performed by Winbindd with a configurable plugin interface\&. Samba\*(Aqs ID mapping is configured by options starting with the
\m[blue]\fBidmap config\fR\m[]
prefix\&. An idmap option consists of the
\m[blue]\fBidmap config\fR\m[]
prefix, followed by a domain name or the asterisk character (*), a colon, and the name of an idmap setting for the chosen domain\&.
.sp
The idmap configuration is hence divided into groups, one group for each domain to be configured, and one group with the the asterisk instead of a proper domain name, which speifies the default configuration that is used to catch all domains that do not have an explicit idmap configuration of their own\&.
.sp
There are three general options available:
.PP

.sp
The first three of these create mappings of their own using internal unixid counters and store the mappings in a database\&. These are suitable for use in the default idmap configuration\&. The rid and hash backends use a pure algorithmic calculation to determine the unixid for a SID\&. The autorid module is a mixture of the tdb and rid backend\&. It creates ranges for each domain encountered and then uses the rid algorithm for each of these automatically configured domains individually\&. The ad and adex backends both use unix IDs stored in Active Directory via the standard schema extensions\&.

.RS 4
By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the Unix\-style NSS subsystem to access user and group information\&. Due to the way Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group this inevitably leads to inefficiencies\&. One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he is member of\&. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP\&. UNIX has optimized functions to enumerate group membership\&. Sadly, other functions that are used to deal with user and group attributes lack such optimization\&.
.sp
To make Samba scale well in large environments, the
\m[blue]\fBldapsam:trusted = yes\fR\m[]
option assumes that the complete user and group database that is relevant to Samba is stored in LDAP with the standard posixAccount/posixGroup attributes\&. It further assumes that the Samba auxiliary object classes are stored together with the POSIX data in the same LDAP object\&. If these assumptions are met,
\m[blue]\fBldapsam:trusted = yes\fR\m[]
can be activated and Samba can bypass the NSS system to query user group memberships\&. Optimized LDAP queries can greatly speed up domain logon and administration tasks\&. Depending on the size of the LDAP database a factor of 100 or more for common queries is easily achieved\&.

.RS 4
This parameter controls whether Samba supports level2 (read\-only) oplocks on a share\&.

Level2, or read\-only oplocks allow Windows NT clients that have an oplock on a file to downgrade from a read\-write oplock to a read\-only oplock once a second client opens the file (instead of releasing all oplocks on a second open, as in traditional, exclusive oplocks)\&. This allows all openers of the file that support level2 oplocks to cache the file for read\-ahead only (ie\&. they may not cache writes or lock requests) and increases performance for many accesses of files that are not commonly written (such as application \&.EXE files)\&.
.sp
Once one of the clients which have a read\-only oplock writes to the file all clients are notified (no reply is needed or waited for) and told to break their oplocks to "none" and delete any read\-ahead caches\&.

.sp
When not in domain mode with winbindd then the security info copied onto the local workstation has no meaning to the logged in user (SID) on that workstation so the profile storing fails\&. Adding this parameter onto a share used for profile storage changes two things about the returned Windows ACL\&. Firstly it changes the owner and group owner of all reported files and directories to be BUILTIN\e\eAdministrators, BUILTIN\e\eUsers respectively (SIDs S\-1\-5\-32\-544, S\-1\-5\-32\-545)\&. Secondly it adds an ACE entry of "Full Control" to the SID BUILTIN\e\eUsers to every returned ACL\&. This will allow any Windows 2000 or XP workstation user to access the profile\&.
.sp
Note that if you have multiple users logging on to a workstation then in order to prevent them from being able to access each others profiles you must remove the "Bypass traverse checking" advanced user right\&. This will prevent access to other users profile directories as the top level profile directory (named after the user) is created by the workstation profile code and has an ACL restricting entry to the directory tree to the owning user\&.

Note that this parameter should be set to yes on dedicated profile shares only\&. On other shares, it might cause incorrect file ownerships\&.

.RS 4
This option affects how clients respond to Samba and is one of the most important settings in the
smb\&.conf

.sp
The option sets the "security mode bit" in replies to protocol negotiations with
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
to turn share level security on or off\&. Clients decide based on this bit whether (and how) to transfer user and password information to the server\&.
.sp
The default is
security = user, as this is the most common setting needed when talking to Windows 98 and Windows NT\&.
.sp
The alternatives are
security = ads
or
security = domain, which support joining Samba to a Windows domain, along with
security = share
and
security = server, both of which are deprecated\&.
.sp
In versions of Samba prior to 2\&.0\&.0, the default was
security = share
mainly because that was the only option at one stage\&.

You should use
security = user

\m[blue]\fBencrypted passwords\fR\m[]
parameter) can also be used in this security mode\&. Parameters such as
\m[blue]\fBuser\fR\m[]

Normally this folder will contain an icon for the MS Add Printer Wizard (APW)\&. However, it is possible to disable this feature regardless of the level of privilege of the connected user\&.

Under normal circumstances, the Windows NT/2000 client will open a handle on the printer server with OpenPrinterEx() asking for Administrator privileges\&. If the user does not have administrative access on the print server (i\&.e is not root or a member of the

smb encrypt (S)
.\" smb encrypt
.PP
.RS 4
This is a new feature introduced with Samba 3\&.2 and above\&. It is an extension to the SMB/CIFS protocol negotiated as part of the UNIX extensions\&. SMB encryption uses the GSSAPI (SSPI on Windows) ability to encrypt and sign every request/response in a SMB protocol stream\&. When enabled it provides a secure method of SMB/CIFS communication, similar to an ssh protected session, but using SMB/CIFS authentication to negotiate encryption and signing keys\&. Currently this is only supported by Samba 3\&.2 smbclient, and hopefully soon Linux CIFSFS and MacOS/X clients\&. Windows clients do not support this feature\&.
.sp
This controls whether the remote client is allowed or required to use SMB encryption\&. Possible values are
\fIauto\fR,
\fImandatory\fR
and
\fIdisabled\fR\&. This may be set on a per\-share basis, but clients may chose to encrypt the entire session, not just traffic to a specific share\&. If this is set to mandatory then all traffic to a share
\fImust\fR
must be encrypted once the connection has been made to the share\&. The server would return "access denied" to all non\-encrypted requests on such a share\&. Selecting encrypted traffic reduces throughput as smaller packet sizes must be used (no huge UNIX style read/writes allowed) as well as the overhead of encrypting and signing all the data\&.
.sp
If SMB encryption is selected, Windows style SMB signing (see the
\m[blue]\fBserver signing\fR\m[]
option) is no longer necessary, as the GSSAPI flags use select both signing and sealing of the data\&.
.sp
When set to auto, SMB encryption is offered, but not enforced\&. When set to mandatory, SMB encryption is required and if set to disabled, SMB encryption can not be negotiated\&.

This extended attribute is explicitly hidden from smbd clients requesting an EA list\&. On Linux the filesystem must have been mounted with the mount option user_xattr in order for extended attributes to work, also extended attributes must be compiled into the Linux kernel\&. In Samba 3\&.5\&.0 and above the "user\&.DOSATTRIB" extended attribute has been extended to store the create time for a file as well as the DOS attributes\&. This is done in a backwards compatible way so files created by Samba 3\&.5\&.0 and above can still have the DOS attribute read from this extended attribute by earlier versions of Samba, but they will not be able to read the create time stored there\&. Storing the create time separately from the normal filesystem meta\-data allows Samba to faithfully reproduce NTFS semantics on top of a POSIX filesystem\&.

This is a boolean that controls the handling of disk space allocation in the server\&. When this is set to

the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file is created or extended to be a given size\&. In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files\&.
.sp
This option is really desgined for file systems that support fast allocation of large numbers of blocks such as extent\-based file systems\&. On file systems that don\*(Aqt support extents (most notably ext3) this can make Samba slower\&. When you work with large files over >100MB on file systems without extents you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts\&.
.sp
When you have an extent based filesystem it\*(Aqs likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate\&. With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas\&. Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation\&.
.sp
To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents\&. On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files\&.

The problem is that because the client considers the printer to be local, it will attempt to issue the OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated with the logged on user\&. If the user possesses local administator rights but not root privilege on the Samba host (often the case), the OpenPrinterEx() call will fail\&. The result is that the client will now display an "Access Denied; Unable to connect" message in the printer queue window (even though jobs may successfully be printed)\&.
.sp
If this parameter is enabled for a printer, then any attempt to open the printer with the PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER right is mapped to PRINTER_ACCESS_USE instead\&. Thus allowing the OpenPrinterEx() call to succeed\&.

Mapping usernames with the

features of Samba can be relatively expensive\&. During login of a user, the mapping is done several times\&. In particular, calling the

username map (G)
.\" username map
.PP
.RS 4
This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server\&. This can be used for several purposes\&. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses\&. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files\&.
.sp
Please note that for user or share mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user credentials\&. Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified enties in the map table (e\&.g\&. biddle =
DOMAIN\efoo)\&.
.sp
The map file is parsed line by line\&. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a \*(Aq=\*(Aq followed by a list of usernames on the right\&. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group\&. The special client name \*(Aq*\*(Aq is a wildcard and matches any name\&. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long\&.
.sp
The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the \*(Aq=\*(Aq signs\&. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left\&. Processing then continues with the next line\&.
.sp
If any line begins with a \*(Aq#\*(Aq or a \*(Aq;\*(Aq then it is ignored\&.
.sp
If any line begins with an \*(Aq!\*(Aq then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line\&. Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed\&. Using \*(Aq!\*(Aq is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file\&.
.sp
For example to map from the name
\fBadmin\fR
or
\fBadministrator\fR
to the UNIX name
\fB root\fR
you would use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
root = admin administrator
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Or to map anyone in the UNIX group
\fBsystem\fR
to the UNIX name
\fBsys\fR
you would use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
sys = @system
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file\&.
.sp
If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup database is checked before the
/etc/group
database for matching groups\&.
.sp
You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double quotes around the name\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username "tridge"\&.
.sp
The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest\&. Note the use of the \*(Aq!\*(Aq to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
!sys = mary fred
guest = *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames\&. Thus if you connect to \e\eserver\efred and
\fBfred\fR
is remapped to
\fBmary\fR
then you will actually be connecting to \e\eserver\emary and will need to supply a password suitable for
\fBmary\fR
not
\fBfred\fR\&. The only exception to this is the username passed to the
\m[blue]\fBpassword server\fR\m[]
(if you have one)\&. The password server will receive whatever username the client supplies without modification\&.
.sp
Also note that no reverse mapping is done\&. The main effect this has is with printing\&. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don\*(Aqt own the print job\&.
.sp
Samba versions prior to 3\&.0\&.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e\&.g\&.:
DOMAIN\euser) from the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client\&. However, when looking up a map entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be used for matches\&. This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes even on the same server\&.
.sp
The following functionality is obeyed in version 3\&.0\&.8 and later:
.sp
When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate the connection\&.
.sp
When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map to the fully qualified username (i\&.e\&.
DOMAIN\euser) only after the user has been successfully authenticated\&.
.sp
An example of use is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
username map = /usr/local/samba/lib/users\&.map

.if n \{\

Multiple users may be specified in a comma\-delimited list, in which case the supplied password will be tested against each username in turn (left to right)\&.

The deprecated
\fIusername\fR

.sp
The
\fIusername\fR
line is not a great solution in many cases as it means Samba will try to validate the supplied password against each of the usernames in the
\fIusername\fR
line in turn\&. This is slow and a bad idea for lots of users in case of duplicate passwords\&. You may get timeouts or security breaches using this parameter unwisely\&.
.sp
Samba relies on the underlying UNIX security\&. This parameter does not restrict who can login, it just offers hints to the Samba server as to what usernames might correspond to the supplied password\&. Users can login as whoever they please and they will be able to do no more damage than if they started a telnet session\&. The daemon runs as the user that they log in as, so they cannot do anything that user cannot do\&.
.sp
To restrict a service to a particular set of users you can use the
\m[blue]\fBvalid users\fR\m[]
parameter\&.
.sp
If any of the usernames begin with a \*(Aq@\*(Aq then the name will be looked up first in the NIS netgroups list (if Samba is compiled with netgroup support), followed by a lookup in the UNIX groups database and will expand to a list of all users in the group of that name\&.
