.SH "NAME"
vfs_recycle \- Samba VFS recycle bin
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
vfs objects = recycle
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This VFS module is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
The
vfs_recycle
intercepts file deletion requests and moves the affected files to a temporary repository rather than deleting them immediately\&. This gives the same effect as the Recycle Bin on Windows computers\&.
.PP
The Recycle Bin will not appear in Windows Explorer views of the network file system (share) nor on any mapped drive\&. Instead, a directory called \&.recycle will be automatically created when the first file is deleted and recycle:repository is not configured\&. If recycle:repository is configured, the name of the created directory depends on recycle:repository\&. Users can recover files from the recycle bin\&. If the recycle:keeptree option has been specified, deleted files will be found in a path identical with that from which the file was deleted\&.
.PP
This module is stackable\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
recycle:repository = PATH
.RS 4
Path of the directory where deleted files should be moved\&.
.sp
If this option is not set, the default path \&.recycle is used\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:directory_mode = MODE
.RS 4
Set MODE to the octal mode the recycle repository should be created with\&. The recycle repository will be created when first file is deleted\&. If recycle:subdir_mode is not set, MODE also applies to subdirectories\&.
.sp
If this option is not set, the default mode 0700 is used\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:subdir_mode = MODE
.RS 4
Set MODE to the octal mode with which sub directories of the recycle repository should be created\&.
.sp
If this option is not set, subdirectories will be created with the mode from recycle:directory_mode\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:keeptree = BOOL
.RS 4
Specifies whether the directory structure should be preserved or whether the files in a directory that is being deleted should be kept separately in the repository\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:versions = BOOL
.RS 4
If this option is True, two files with the same name that are deleted will both be kept in the repository\&. Newer deleted versions of a file will be called "Copy #x of filename"\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:touch = BOOL
.RS 4
Specifies whether a file\*(Aqs access date should be updated when the file is moved to the repository\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:touch_mtime = BOOL
.RS 4
Specifies whether a file\*(Aqs last modified date should be updated when the file is moved to the repository\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:minsize = BYTES
.RS 4
Files that are smaller than the number of bytes specified by this parameter will not be put into the repository\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:maxsize = BYTES
.RS 4
Files that are larger than the number of bytes specified by this parameter will not be put into the repository\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:exclude = LIST
.RS 4
List of files that should not be put into the repository when deleted, but deleted in the normal way\&. Wildcards such as * and ? are supported\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:exclude_dir = LIST
.RS 4
List of directories whose files should not be put into the repository when deleted, but deleted in the normal way\&. Wildcards such as * and ? are supported\&.
.RE
.PP
recycle:noversions = LIST
.RS 4
Specifies a list of paths (wildcards such as * and ? are supported) for which no versioning should be used\&. Only useful when recycle:versions is enabled\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Move files "deleted" on
\fIshare\fR
to
\fI/data/share/\&.recycle\fR
instead of deleting them:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        \fI[share]\fR
	\m[blue]\fBpath = /data/share\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBvfs objects = recycle\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBrecycle:repository = \&.recycle\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBrecycle:keeptree = yes\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBrecycle:versions = yes\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3\&.0\&.25 of the Samba suite\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
