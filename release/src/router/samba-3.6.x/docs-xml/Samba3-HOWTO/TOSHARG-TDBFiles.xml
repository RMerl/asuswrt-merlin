	Samba uses a lightweight database called Trivial Database (tdb) in which it stores persistent and transient data.
	Some tdb files can be disposed of before restarting Samba, but others are used to store information that is vital
	to Samba configuration and behavior. The following information is provided to help administrators who are seeking
	to better manage their Samba installations.

<indexterm><primary>backup</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>restore</primary></indexterm>
	Those who package Samba for commercial distribution with operating systems and appliances would do well to take
	note that tdb files can get corrupted, and for this reason ought to be backed up regularly.  An appropriate time
	is at system shutdown (backup) and startup (restore from backup).

<title>Managing TDB Files</title>

	<para>
	The <command>tdbbackup</command> utility is a tool that may be used to backup samba tdb files.
	This tool may also be used to verify the integrity of the tdb files prior to Samba startup or
	during normal operation. If it finds file damage it will search for a prior backup the backup
	file from which the damaged tdb file will be restored. The <command>tdbbackup</command>
	utility can safely be run at any time. It was designed so that it can be used at any time to
	validate the integrity of tdb files, even during Samba operation.
	</para>

	<para>
	It is recommended to backup all tdb files as part of the Samba start-up scripts on a Samba
	server. The following command syntax can be used:
	</para>
<screen>
myserver# > cd /var/lib/samba
myserver@ > tdbbackup *.tdb
</screen>
	<para>
	The default extension is <filename>.bak</filename>. Any alternate extension can be specified
	by executing <literal>tdbbackup -s 'new_extension' *.tdb</literal> as part of your startup script.
	</para>
