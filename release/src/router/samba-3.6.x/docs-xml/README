$ make help

What are DocBook documents doing in the Samba Distribution ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

We have converted all samba docs to XML/DocBook V4.2
in order to make them easier to maintain and produce a nicer looking
product.

This short note (strange isn't it how it always starts out as a short note
and becomes a long one ?) will explain very briefly how and why we have
done this.


The format
----------

If you are new to xml, regard an xml file as 'source code'. You don't
read it directly, but use it to create other formats (like the txt and html
included in ../txtdocs and ../htmldocs).

Docbook is a particular XML style, particularly suited to producing
technical manuals. 

For more information on DocBook tags and format, see "DocBook: The 
Definitive Guide" by Walsh and Muellner, (c) O'Reilly Publishing.
This book covers DocBook V4.2 and is available on-line
at http://www.docbook.org/

The Output
----------
The current Samba Subversion tree contains the XML/DocBook source files.

A regularly generated version can be found at http://samba.org/samba/docs/.

The Tools
---------

To generate the docs, you need to have the following packages installed:

 * GNU Make
 * GNU autoconf
 * xsltproc
 * inkscape

For generating PDF and PostScript (thru LaTeX):
 * dblatex (from http://dblatex.sf.net/)

For generating PDF (thru FO):
 * fop (http://xml.apache.org/fop/)

For generating ASCII:
 * html2text

For generating Palm-viewable docs:
 * plucker-build

For generating texi files:
 * docbook2x-texi
 * makeinfo

For validating:
 * xmllint

This directory now contains a ./configure script and Makefile to 
support the automated building of man pages (including HTML versions), and 
the building of the Samba-HOWTO-Collection and the 
Samba Developers Guide (HTML,TeX,PDF,PS,Text versions).

The configure script detects which of the required utilities are installed 
and builds as much docs as it can using these tools.

Help! Building the docs generates a lot of HTTP traffic...
----------------------------------------------------------

To be able to build the docs without an internet connection (or faster with 
a slow internet connection), you need to set up "catalogs".

For the Pearson DTD, add something like:

  <public publicId="-//Pearson//DTD Books//DE" uri="file:///home/jelmer/Xml_dtd_1.1/pearson.dtd"/>

For the Samba DTD's, add something like:
  <rewriteURI uriStartString="http://www.samba.org/samba/DTD" rewritePrefix="file:///home/jelmer/samba-web/DTD"/>

catalog entries for the other DTD's and XSL scripts should be present on your 
system already.
