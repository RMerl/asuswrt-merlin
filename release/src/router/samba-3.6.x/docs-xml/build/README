HOW TO BUILD SAMBA DOCUMENTATION WITHOUT NETWORK ACCESS
-------------------------------------------------------

Samba documentation depends on several DTD schema specification and XML files
that are stored in samba-web Subversion repository and hosted publicly through
Samba.org web-site. In order to do networkless builds a local XML catalog should
provide a local replica of those files.

The easiest way to provide them is to fetch samba-docs subversion repository.
In this directory (build/) we reference samba-web repository as external source
so that Subversion fetches current state of DTDs out of samba-web repository.
You then need to point xsltproc utility to use locally-provided version of DTDs.

It is done by setting XML_CATALOG_FILES variable:

export XML_CATALOG_FILES="file:///etc/xml/catalog file://$(pwd)/build/catalog.xml"

where $(pwd)/build/catalog.xml is generated from $(pwd)/build/catalog.xml.in by a 
following command:

cat $(pwd)/build/catalog.xml.in | sed -e "s|@BUILDDIR@|$(pwd)|g" > $(pwd)/build/catalog.xml

where $(pwd) assumes that you're in the top-level directory of samba-docs.

After those steps a regular make process can be followed and xsltproc will automatically
use locally-provided DTDs through catalog.xml we've created.
