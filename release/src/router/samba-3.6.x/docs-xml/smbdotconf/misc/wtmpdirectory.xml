	<para>
	This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled with the option <command moreinfo="none">
	--with-utmp</command>. It specifies a directory pathname that is used to store the wtmp or wtmpx files (depending on 
	the UNIX system) that record user connections to a Samba server. The difference with the utmp directory is the fact 
	that user info is kept after a user has logged out.
	</para>
		
	<para>
	By default this is not set, meaning the system will use whatever utmp file the 	native system is set to use (usually 
	<filename moreinfo="none">/var/run/wtmp</filename> on Linux).
	</para>
