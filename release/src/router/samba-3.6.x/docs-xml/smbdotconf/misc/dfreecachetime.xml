	<para>
	The <parameter moreinfo="none">dfree cache time</parameter> should only be used on systems where a problem
	occurs with the internal disk space calculations. This has been known to happen with Ultrix, but may occur
	with other operating systems. The symptom that was seen was an error of &quot;Abort Retry Ignore&quot; at the
	end of each directory listing.
	</para>

	<para>
	This is a new parameter introduced in Samba version 3.0.21.  It specifies in seconds the time that smbd will
	cache the output of a disk free query. If set to zero (the default) no caching is done. This allows a heavily
	loaded server to prevent rapid spawning of <smbconfoption name="dfree command"/> scripts increasing the load.
	</para>

	<para>
	By default this parameter is zero, meaning no caching will be done.
	</para>
