	<para>
	This boolean parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled  
	with the option <command moreinfo="none">--with-utmp</command>. If set to 
	 <constant>yes</constant> then Samba will attempt to add utmp or utmpx records 
	(depending on the UNIX system) whenever a connection is made to a Samba server. 
	Sites may use this to record the user connecting to a Samba share.
	</para>

	<para>
	Due to the requirements of the utmp record, we 	are required to create a unique 
	identifier for the incoming user.  Enabling this option creates an n^2 	algorithm 
	to find this number.  This may impede performance on large installations.
