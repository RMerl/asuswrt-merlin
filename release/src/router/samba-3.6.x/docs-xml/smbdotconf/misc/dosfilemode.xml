	<para> The default behavior in Samba is to provide
	UNIX-like behavior where only the owner of a file/directory is
	able to change the permissions on it.  However, this behavior
	is often confusing to  DOS/Windows users.  Enabling this parameter
	allows a user who has write access to the file (by whatever
	means, including an ACL permission) to modify the permissions
	(including ACL) on it. Note that a user belonging to the group
	owning the file will not be allowed to change permissions if
	the group is only granted read access. Ownership of the
	file/directory may also be changed.

	Note that using the VFS modules acl_xattr or acl_tdb which store native
	Windows as meta-data will automatically turn this option on for any
	share for which they are loaded, as they require this option to emulate
	Windows ACLs correctly.
