	<para>This parameter specifies the absolute path of the directory on the
	filesystem used to store the user defined share definition files.
	This directory must be owned by root, and have no access for
	other, and be writable only by the group owner. In addition the
	"sticky" bit must also be set, restricting rename and delete to
	owners of a file (in the same way the /tmp directory is usually configured).
	Members of the group owner of this directory are the users allowed to create
	usershares. If this parameter is undefined then no user defined
	shares are allowed.
	</para>
	<para>
	For example, a valid usershare directory might be /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares,
	set up as follows.
	</para>
	<para>
	<programlisting>
	ls -ld /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares/
	drwxrwx--T  2 root power_users 4096 2006-05-05 12:27 /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares/
	</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	In this case, only members of the group "power_users" can create user defined shares.
	</para>
