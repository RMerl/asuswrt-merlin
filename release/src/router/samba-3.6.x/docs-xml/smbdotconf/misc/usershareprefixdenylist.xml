	<para>This parameter specifies a list of absolute pathnames
	the root of which are NOT allowed to be exported by user defined share definitions.
	If the pathname exported starts with one of the strings in this
	list the user defined share will not be allowed. Any pathname not
	starting with one of these strings will be allowed to be exported
	as a usershare. This allows the Samba administrator to restrict the
	directories on the system that can be exported by user defined shares.
	</para>
	<para>
	If there is a "usershare prefix deny list" and also a
	"usershare prefix allow list" the deny list is processed
	first, followed by the allow list, thus leading to the most
	restrictive interpretation.
