	<para>Under DOS and Windows, if a user can write to a 
	file they can change the timestamp on it. Under POSIX semantics, 
	only the owner of the file or root may change the timestamp. By 
	default, Samba emulates the DOS semantics and allows to change the 
	timestamp on a file if the user <command moreinfo="none">smbd</command> is acting 
	on behalf has write permissions.
	Due to changes in Microsoft Office 2000 and beyond,
	the default for this parameter has been changed from "no" to "yes" in Samba 3.0.14
	and above. Microsoft Excel will display dialog box warnings about the file being
	changed by another user if this parameter is not set to "yes" and files are being
	shared between users.
