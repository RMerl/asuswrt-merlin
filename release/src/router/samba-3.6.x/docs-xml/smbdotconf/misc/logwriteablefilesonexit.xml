	<para>
	When the network connection between a CIFS client and Samba
	dies, Samba has no option but to simply shut down the server
	side of the network connection. If this happens, there is a
	risk of data corruption because the Windows client did not
	complete all write operations that the Windows application
	requested. Setting this option to "yes" makes smbd log with
	a level 0 message a list of all files that have been opened
	for writing when the network connection died. Those are the
	files that are potentially corrupted. It is meant as an aid
	for the administrator to give him a list of files to do
	consistency checks on.
