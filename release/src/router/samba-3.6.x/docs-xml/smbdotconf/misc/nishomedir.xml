	<para>Get the home share server from a NIS map. For 
	UNIX systems that use an automounter, the user's home directory 
	will often be mounted on a workstation on demand from a remote 
	server. </para>

	<para>When the Samba logon server is not the actual home directory 
	server, but is mounting the home directories via NFS then two 
	network hops would be required to access the users home directory 
	if the logon server told the client to use itself as the SMB server 
	for home directories (one over SMB and one over NFS). This can 
	be very slow.</para>

	<para>This option allows Samba to return the home share as 
	being on a different server to the logon server and as 
	long as a Samba daemon is running on the home directory server, 
	it will be mounted on the Samba client directly from the directory 
	server. When Samba is returning the home share to the client, it 
	will consult the NIS map specified in
	<smbconfoption name="homedir map"/> and return the server 
	listed there.</para>

	<para>Note that for this option to work there must be a working 
	NIS system and the Samba server with this option must also 
	be a logon server.</para>
