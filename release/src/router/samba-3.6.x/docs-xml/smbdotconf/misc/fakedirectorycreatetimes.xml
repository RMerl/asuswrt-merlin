	<para>NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create 
	time for all files and directories. This is not the same as the 
	ctime - status change time - that Unix keeps, so Samba by default 
	reports the earliest of the various times Unix does keep. Setting 
	this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 
	1-1-1980 as the create time for directories.</para>

	<para>This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for 
	Visual C++ when used against Samba shares. Visual C++ generated 
	makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object 
	file, and a make rule to create the directory. Also, when NMAKE 
	compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a 
	directory. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not 
	exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier 
	timestamp than the object files it contains.</para>

	<para>However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time 
	reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or 
	or deleted in the directory.  NMAKE finds all object files in 
	the object directory.  The timestamp of the last one built is then 
	compared to the timestamp of the object directory.  If the 
	directory's timestamp if newer, then all object files
	will be rebuilt.  Enabling this option 
	ensures directories always predate their contents and an NMAKE build 
	will proceed as expected.</para>
