	<para>
	This option allows you to setup <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nmbd</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> to periodically announce itself 
	to arbitrary IP addresses with an arbitrary workgroup name.
	</para>

	<para>
	This is useful if you want your Samba server to appear in a remote workgroup for 
	which the normal browse propagation rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be 
	anywhere that you can send IP packets to.
	</para>

	<para>
	For example:
<programlisting>
<command moreinfo="none">remote announce = 192.168.2.255/SERVERS 192.168.4.255/STAFF</command>
</programlisting>
	the above line would cause <command moreinfo="none">nmbd</command> to announce itself 
	to the two given IP addresses using the given workgroup names. If you leave out the 
	workgroup name, then the one given in the <smbconfoption name="workgroup"/> parameter 
	is used instead.
	</para>

	<para>
	The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast addresses of the remote 
	networks, but can also be the IP addresses of known browse masters if your network 
	config is that stable.
	</para>

	<para>
	See the chapter on Network Browsing in the Samba-HOWTO book.
