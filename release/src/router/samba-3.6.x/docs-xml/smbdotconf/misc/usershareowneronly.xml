	<para>This parameter controls whether the pathname exported by
	a user defined shares must be owned by the user creating the
	user defined share or not. If set to True (the default) then
	smbd checks that the directory path being shared is owned by
	the user who owns the usershare file defining this share and
	refuses to create the share if not. If set to False then no
	such check is performed and any directory path may be exported
	regardless of who owns it.
