	<para>This parameter specifies the name of a file which, 
	if opened, will be executed by the server when the file is closed. 
	This allows a UNIX script to be sent to the Samba host and 
	executed on behalf of the connected user.</para>

	<para>Scripts executed in this way will be deleted upon 
	completion assuming that the user has the appropriate level 
	of privilege and the file permissions allow the deletion.</para>

	<para>If the script generates output, output will be sent to 
	the file specified by the <smbconfoption name="magic output"/>
	parameter (see above).</para>

	<para>Note that some shells are unable to interpret scripts 
	containing CR/LF instead of CR as 
	the end-of-line marker. Magic scripts must be executable 
	<emphasis>as is</emphasis> on the host, which for some hosts and 
	some shells will require filtering at the DOS end.</para>

	<para>Magic scripts are <emphasis>EXPERIMENTAL</emphasis> and 
		should <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> be relied upon.</para>
