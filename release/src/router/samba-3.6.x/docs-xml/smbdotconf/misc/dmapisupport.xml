<description>
	<para>This parameter specifies whether Samba should use DMAPI to
	determine whether a file is offline or not. This would typically
	be used in conjunction with a hierarchical storage system that
	automatically migrates files to tape.
	</para>

	<para>Note that Samba infers the status of a file by examining the
	events that a DMAPI application has registered interest in. This
	heuristic is satisfactory for a number of hierarchical storage
	systems, but there may be system for which it will fail. In this
	case, Samba may erroneously report files to be offline.
	</para>

	<para>This parameter is only available if a supported DMAPI
	implementation was found at compilation time. It will only be used
	if DMAPI is found to enabled on the system at run time.
