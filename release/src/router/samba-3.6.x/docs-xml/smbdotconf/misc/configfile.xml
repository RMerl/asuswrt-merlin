	<para>This allows you to override the config file 
	to use, instead of the default (usually <filename moreinfo="none">smb.conf</filename>). 
	There is a chicken and egg problem here as this option is set 
	in the config file!</para>

	<para>For this reason, if the name of the config file has changed 
	when the parameters are loaded then it will reload them from 
	the new config file.</para>

	<para>This option takes the usual substitutions, which can 
	be very useful.</para>

	<para>If the config file doesn't exist then it won't be loaded 
	(allowing you to special case the config files of just a few 
	clients).</para>
