	<para>
	In a cluster environment using Samba and ctdb it is critical
	that locks on central ctdb-hosted databases like locking.tdb
	are not held for long. With the current Samba architecture
	it happens that Samba takes a lock and while holding that
	lock makes file system calls into the shared cluster file
	system. This option makes Samba warn if it detects that it
	has held locks for the specified number of milliseconds. If
	this happens, <emphasis>smbd</emphasis> will emit a debug level 0
	message into its logs and potentially into syslog. The most likely
	reason for such a log message is that an operation of the cluster
	file system Samba exports is taking longer than expected.
	The messages are meant as a debugging aid for potential
	cluster problems.
	</para>

	<para>The default value of 0 disables this logging.</para>
