	<para>This parameter specifies a list of absolute pathnames
	the root of which are allowed to be exported by user defined share definitions.
	If the pathname to be exported doesn't start with one of the strings in this
	list, the user defined share will not be allowed. This allows the Samba
	administrator to restrict the directories on the system that can be
	exported by user defined shares.
	</para>
	<para>
	If there is a "usershare prefix deny list" and also a
	"usershare prefix allow list" the deny list is processed
	first, followed by the allow list, thus leading to the most
	restrictive interpretation.
