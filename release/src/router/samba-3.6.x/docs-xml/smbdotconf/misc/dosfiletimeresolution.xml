	<para>Under the DOS and Windows FAT filesystem, the finest 
	granularity on time resolution is two seconds. Setting this parameter 
	for a share causes Samba to round the reported time down to the 
	nearest two second boundary when a query call that requires one second 
	resolution is made to <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

	<para>This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual 
	C++ when used against Samba shares. If oplocks are enabled on a 
	share, Visual C++ uses two different time reading calls to check if a 
	file has changed since it was last read. One of these calls uses a
	one-second granularity, the other uses a two second granularity. As
	the two second call rounds any odd second down, then if the file has a
	timestamp of an odd number of seconds then the two timestamps will not
	match and Visual C++ will keep reporting the file has changed. Setting
	this option causes the two timestamps to match, and Visual C++ is
	happy.</para>
