	<para>This parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the
	  connection between Samba and ctdb. It is only valid if you
	  have compiled Samba with clustering and if you have
	  set <parameter>clustering=yes</parameter>.
	</para>
	<para>When something in the cluster blocks, it can happen that
	  we wait indefinitely long for ctdb, just adding to the
	  blocking condition. In a well-running cluster this should
	  never happen, but there are too many components in a cluster
	  that might have hickups. Choosing the right balance for this
	  value is very tricky, because on a busy cluster long service
	  times to transfer something across the cluster might be
	  valid. Setting it too short will degrade the service your
	  cluster presents, setting it too long might make the cluster
	  itself not recover from something severely broken for too
	  long.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Be aware that if you set this parameter, this needs to be in
	  the file smb.conf, it is not really helpful to put this into
	  a registry configuration (typical on a cluster), because to
	  access the registry contact to ctdb is requred.
	</para>
	<para>Setting <parameter>ctdb timeout</parameter> to n makes
	  any process waiting longer than n seconds for a reply by the
	  cluster panic. Setting it to 0 (the default) makes Samba
	  block forever, which is the highly recommended default.
