        <para>
		This sets the NetBIOS name by which a Samba server is known. By default it is the same as the first component
		of the host's DNS name. If a machine is a browse server or logon server this name (or the first component of
		the hosts DNS name) will be the name that these services are advertised under.
		</para>

		<para>
		There is a bug in Samba-3 that breaks operation of browsing and access to shares if the netbios name
		is set to the literal name <literal>PIPE</literal>. To avoid this problem, do not name your Samba-3
		server <literal>PIPE</literal>.
