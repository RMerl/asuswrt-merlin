        <para>This is a list of NetBIOS names that nmbd will 
        advertise as additional names by which the Samba server is known. This allows one machine 
	to appear in browse lists under multiple names. If a machine is acting as a browse server 
        or logon server none of these names will be advertised as either browse server or logon 
	servers, only the primary name of the machine will be advertised with these capabilities.
