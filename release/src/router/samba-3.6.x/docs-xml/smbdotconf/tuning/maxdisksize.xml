    <para>This option allows you to put an upper limit 
    on the apparent size of disks. If you set this option to 100 
    then all shares will appear to be not larger than 100 MB in 
    size.</para>

    <para>Note that this option does not limit the amount of 
    data you can put on the disk. In the above case you could still 
    store much more than 100 MB on the disk, but if a client ever asks 
    for the amount of free disk space or the total disk size then the 
    result will be bounded by the amount specified in <parameter moreinfo="none">max 
    disk size</parameter>.</para>

    <para>This option is primarily useful to work around bugs 
    in some pieces of software that can't handle very large disks, 
    particularly disks over 1GB in size.</para>

    <para>A <parameter moreinfo="none">max disk size</parameter> of 0 means no limit.</para>
