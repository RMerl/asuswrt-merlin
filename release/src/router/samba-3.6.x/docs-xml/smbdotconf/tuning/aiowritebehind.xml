	<para>If Samba has been built with asynchronous I/O support,
	Samba will not wait until write requests are finished before returning
	the result to the client for files listed in this parameter.
	Instead, Samba will immediately return that the write
	request has been finished successfully, no matter if the
	operation will succeed or not. This might speed up clients without
	aio support, but is really dangerous, because data could be lost
	and files could be damaged.

	The syntax is identical to the <smbconfoption name="veto files"/>
	parameter.
