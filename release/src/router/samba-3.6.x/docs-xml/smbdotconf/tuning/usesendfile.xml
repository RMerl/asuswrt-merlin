    <para>If this parameter is <constant>yes</constant>, and the <constant>sendfile()</constant> 
    system call is supported by the underlying operating system, then some SMB read calls 
    (mainly ReadAndX and ReadRaw) will use the more efficient sendfile system call for files that
    are exclusively oplocked. This may make more efficient use of the system CPU's
    and cause Samba to be faster. Samba automatically turns this off for clients
    that use protocol levels lower than NT LM 0.12 and when it detects a client is
    Windows 9x (using sendfile from Linux will cause these clients to fail).
