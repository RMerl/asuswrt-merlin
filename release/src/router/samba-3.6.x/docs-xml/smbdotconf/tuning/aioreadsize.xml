  <para>If Samba has been built with asynchronous I/O support and this
    integer parameter is set to non-zero value,
    Samba will read from file asynchronously when size of request is bigger
    than this value. Note that it happens only for non-chained and non-chaining
    reads and when not using write cache.</para>

  <para>Current implementation of asynchronous I/O in Samba 3.0 does support
    only up to 10 outstanding asynchronous requests, read and write combined.</para>
