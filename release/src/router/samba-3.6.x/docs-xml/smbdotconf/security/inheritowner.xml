<description>
	<para>The ownership of new files and directories 
	is normally governed by effective uid of the connected user.
	This option allows the Samba administrator to specify that
	the ownership for new files and directories should be controlled
	by the ownership of the parent directory.</para>
	
	<para>Common scenarios where this behavior is useful is in 
	implementing drop-boxes where users can create and edit files but not 
	delete them and to ensure that newly create files in a user's
	roaming profile directory are actually owner by the user.</para>
