    <para>This is a boolean option that controls whether 
    connections with usernames not in the <parameter moreinfo="none">user</parameter> 
    list will be allowed. By default this option is disabled so that a 
    client can supply a username to be used by the server.  Enabling
    this parameter will force the server to only use the login 
    names from the <parameter moreinfo="none">user</parameter> list and is only really
    useful in <smbconfoption name="security">share</smbconfoption> level security.</para>

    <para>Note that this also means Samba won't try to deduce 
    usernames from the service name. This can be annoying for 
    the [homes] section. To get around this you could use <command moreinfo="none">user =
    %S</command> which means your <parameter moreinfo="none">user</parameter> list
    will be just the service name, which for home directories is the 
    name of the user.</para>
