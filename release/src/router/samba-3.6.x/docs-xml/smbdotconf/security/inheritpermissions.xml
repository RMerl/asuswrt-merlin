    <para>
	The permissions on new files and directories are normally governed by <smbconfoption name="create mask"/>,
	<smbconfoption name="directory mask"/>, <smbconfoption name="force create mode"/> and <smbconfoption
	name="force directory mode"/> but the boolean inherit permissions parameter overrides this.
	</para>
		
    <para>New directories inherit the mode of the parent directory,
    including bits such as setgid.</para>

    <para>
	New files inherit their read/write bits from the parent directory.  Their execute bits continue to be
	determined by <smbconfoption name="map archive"/>, <smbconfoption name="map hidden"/> and <smbconfoption
	name="map system"/> as usual.
	</para>

    <para>Note that the setuid bit is <emphasis>never</emphasis> set via 
    inheritance (the code explicitly prohibits this).</para>

    <para>This can be particularly useful on large systems with 
    many users, perhaps several thousand, to allow a single [homes] 
    share to be used flexibly by each user.</para>
