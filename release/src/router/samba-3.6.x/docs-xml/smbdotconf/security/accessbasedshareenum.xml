     <para>If this parameter is <constant>yes</constant> for a
    service, then the share hosted by the service will only be visible
    to users who have read or write access to the share during share
    enumeration (for example net view \\sambaserver).  This has
    parallels to access based enumeration, the main difference being
    that only share permissions are evaluated, and security
    descriptors on files contained on the share are not used in
    computing enumeration access rights.</para>
