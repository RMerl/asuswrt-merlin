    <para>The setting of this parameter determines whether user and
    group list information is returned for an anonymous connection.
    and mirrors the effects of the
<programlisting>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\
           Control\LSA\RestrictAnonymous
</programlisting>
	registry key in Windows 2000 and Windows NT.  When set to 0, user
	and group list information is returned to anyone who asks.  When set
    to 1, only an authenticated user can retrive user and
    group list information.  For the value 2, supported by
    Windows 2000/XP and Samba, no anonymous connections are allowed at
    all.  This can break third party and Microsoft
    applications which expect to be allowed to perform
	operations anonymously.</para>

	<para>
    The security advantage of using restrict anonymous = 1 is dubious,
    as user and group list information can be obtained using other
	means.
	</para>

	<note>
	<para>
    The security advantage of using restrict anonymous = 2 is removed
    by setting <smbconfoption name="guest ok">yes</smbconfoption> on any share.
