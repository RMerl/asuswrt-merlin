    <para>This parameter determines whether or not
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbclient</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> and other samba components
    acting as a client will attempt to use the server-supplied
    principal sometimes given in the SPNEGO exchange.</para>

    <para>If enabled, Samba can attempt to use Kerberos to contact
    servers known only by IP address.  Kerberos relies on names, so
    ordinarily cannot function in this situation. </para>

    <para>If disabled, Samba will use the name used to look up the
    server when asking the KDC for a ticket.  This avoids situations
    where a server may impersonate another, soliciting authentication
    as one principal while being known on the network as another.
    </para>

    <para>Note that Windows XP SP2 and later versions already follow
    this behaviour, and Windows Vista and later servers no longer
    supply this 'rfc4178 hint' principal on the server side.</para>
