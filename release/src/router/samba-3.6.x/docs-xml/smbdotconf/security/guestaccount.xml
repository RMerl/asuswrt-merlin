    <para>This is a username which will be used for access 
    to services which are specified as <smbconfoption name="guest ok"/> (see below). Whatever privileges this 
    user has will be available to any client connecting to the guest service. 
    This user must exist in the password file, but does not require
    a valid login. The user account &quot;ftp&quot; is often a good choice 
    for this parameter. 
    </para>

    <para>On some systems the default guest account &quot;nobody&quot; may not 
    be able to print. Use another account in this case. You should test 
    this by trying to log in as your guest user (perhaps by using the 
    <command moreinfo="none">su -</command> command) and trying to print using the 
    system print command such as <command moreinfo="none">lpr(1)</command> or <command moreinfo="none">
    lp(1)</command>.</para>

    <para>This parameter does not accept % macros, because
    many parts of the system require this value to be
	constant for correct operation.</para>
