    <para>This is a list of users who will be granted 
    administrative privileges on the share. This means that they 
    will do all file operations as the super-user (root).</para>

    <para>You should use this option very carefully, as any user in 
    this list will be able to do anything they like on the share, 
    irrespective of file permissions.</para>

    <para>This parameter will not work with the <smbconfoption name="security">share</smbconfoption> in
    Samba 3.0.  This is by design.</para>
