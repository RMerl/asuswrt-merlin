    <para>This parameter determines whether or not <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will attempt to
    authenticate users or permit password changes
    using the LANMAN password hash. If disabled, only clients which support NT 
    password hashes (e.g. Windows NT/2000 clients, smbclient, but not 
    Windows 95/98 or the MS DOS network client) will be able to
    connect to the Samba host.</para>

    <para>The LANMAN encrypted response is easily broken, due to its
    case-insensitive nature, and the choice of algorithm.  Servers
    without Windows 95/98/ME or MS DOS clients are advised to disable
    this option.  </para>

    <para>When this parameter is set to <value>no</value> this
    will also result in sambaLMPassword in Samba's passdb being
    blanked after the next password change. As a result of that
    lanman clients won't be able to authenticate, even if lanman
    auth is reenabled later on.
    </para>
		
    <para>Unlike the <command moreinfo="none">encrypt
    passwords</command> option, this parameter cannot alter client
    behaviour, and the LANMAN response will still be sent over the
    network.  See the <command moreinfo="none">client lanman
    auth</command> to disable this for Samba's clients (such as smbclient)</para>

    <para>If this option, and <command moreinfo="none">ntlm
    auth</command> are both disabled, then only NTLMv2 logins will be
    permited.  Not all clients support NTLMv2, and most will require
    special configuration to use it.</para>
