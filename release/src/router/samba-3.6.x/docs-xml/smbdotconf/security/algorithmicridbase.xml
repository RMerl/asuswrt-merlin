    <para>This determines how Samba will use its
    algorithmic mapping from uids/gid to the RIDs needed to construct
    NT Security Identifiers.
    </para>

    <para>Setting this option to a larger value could be useful to sites
    transitioning from WinNT and Win2k, as existing user and 
    group rids would otherwise clash with sytem users etc. 
    </para>

    <para>All UIDs and GIDs must be able to be resolved into SIDs for  
    the correct operation of ACLs on the server.  As such the algorithmic
    mapping can't be 'turned off', but pushing it 'out of the way' should
    resolve the issues.  Users and groups can then be assigned 'low' RIDs
    in arbitrary-rid supporting backends.
    </para>
