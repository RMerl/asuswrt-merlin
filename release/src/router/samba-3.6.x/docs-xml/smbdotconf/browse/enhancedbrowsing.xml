	<para>This option enables a couple of enhancements to 
	cross-subnet browse propagation that have been added in Samba 
	but which are not standard in Microsoft implementations.  
	</para>

	<para>The first enhancement to browse propagation consists of a regular
	wildcard query to a Samba WINS server for all Domain Master Browsers,
	followed by a browse synchronization with each of the returned
	DMBs. The second enhancement consists of a regular randomised browse
	synchronization with all currently known DMBs.</para>

	<para>You may wish to disable this option if you have a problem with empty
	workgroups not disappearing from browse lists. Due to the restrictions
	of the browse protocols, these enhancements can cause a empty workgroup
	to stay around forever which can be annoying.</para>

	<para>In general you should leave this option enabled as it makes
	cross-subnet browse propagation much more reliable.</para>
