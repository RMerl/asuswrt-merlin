	<para>
	This boolean parameter controls if <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nmbd</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> is a preferred master browser  for its workgroup.
	</para>

	<para>
	If this is set to <constant>yes</constant>, on startup, <command moreinfo="none">nmbd</command> will force
	an election, and it will have a slight advantage in winning the election.  It is recommended that this
	parameter is used in conjunction with <smbconfoption name="domain master">yes</smbconfoption>, so that
	<command moreinfo="none">nmbd</command> can guarantee becoming a domain master.
	</para>

	<para>
	Use this option with caution, because if there are several hosts (whether Samba servers, Windows 95 or NT)
	that are preferred  master browsers on the same subnet, they will each periodically  and continuously attempt
	to become the local master browser. This will result in unnecessary broadcast traffic and reduced browsing
	capabilities.
