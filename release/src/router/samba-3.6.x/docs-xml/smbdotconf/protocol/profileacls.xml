	<para>
	This boolean parameter was added to fix the problems that people have been
	having with storing user profiles on Samba shares from Windows 2000 or
	Windows XP clients. New versions of Windows 2000 or Windows XP service
	packs do security ACL checking on the owner and ability to write of the
	profile directory stored on a local workstation when copied from a Samba
	share.
	</para>

	<para>
	When not in domain mode with winbindd then the security info copied
	onto the local workstation has no meaning to the logged in user (SID) on
	that workstation so the profile storing fails. Adding this parameter
	onto a share used for profile storage changes two things about the
	returned Windows ACL. Firstly it changes the owner and group owner
	of all reported files and directories to be BUILTIN\\Administrators,
	BUILTIN\\Users respectively (SIDs S-1-5-32-544, S-1-5-32-545). Secondly
	it adds an ACE entry of "Full Control" to the SID BUILTIN\\Users to
	every returned ACL. This will allow any Windows 2000 or XP workstation
	user to access the profile.
	</para>

	<para>
	Note that if you have multiple users logging
	on to a workstation then in order to prevent them from being able to access
	each others profiles you must remove the "Bypass traverse checking" advanced
	user right. This will prevent access to other users profile directories as
	the top level profile directory (named after the user) is created by the
	workstation profile code and has an ACL restricting entry to the directory
	tree to the owning user.
	</para>

	<para>
	Note that this parameter should be set to yes on dedicated profile shares only.
	On other shares, it might cause incorrect file ownerships.
	</para>
