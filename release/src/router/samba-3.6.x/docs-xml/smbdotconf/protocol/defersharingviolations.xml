	<para>
	Windows allows specifying how a file will be shared with 
	other processes when it is opened. Sharing violations occur when 
	a file is opened by a different process using options that violate 
	the share settings specified by other processes. This parameter causes
	smbd to act as a Windows server does, and defer returning a "sharing
	violation" error message for up to one second, allowing the client
	to close the file causing the violation in the meantime.
	</para>

	<para>UNIX by default does not have this behaviour.</para>

	<para>
	There should be no reason to turn off this parameter, as it is
	designed to enable Samba to more correctly emulate Windows.
