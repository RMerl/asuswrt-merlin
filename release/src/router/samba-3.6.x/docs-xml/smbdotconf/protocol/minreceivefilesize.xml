<para>This option changes the behavior of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> when processing SMBwriteX calls. Any incoming
SMBwriteX call on a non-signed SMB/CIFS connection greater than this value will not be processed in the normal way but will
be passed to any underlying kernel recvfile or splice system call (if there is no such
call Samba will emulate in user space). This allows zero-copy writes directly from network
socket buffers into the filesystem buffer cache, if available. It may improve performance
but user testing is recommended. If set to zero Samba processes SMBwriteX calls in the
normal way. To enable POSIX large write support (SMB/CIFS writes up to 16Mb) this option must be
nonzero. The maximum value is 128k. Values greater than 128k will be silently set to 128k.</para>
<para>Note this option will have NO EFFECT if set on a SMB signed connection.</para>
<para>The default is zero, which diables this option.</para>
