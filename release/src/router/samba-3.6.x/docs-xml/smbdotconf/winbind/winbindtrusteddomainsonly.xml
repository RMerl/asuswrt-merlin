	<para>
	This parameter is designed to allow Samba servers that are members 
	of a Samba controlled domain to use UNIX accounts distributed via NIS, 
	rsync, or LDAP as the uid's for winbindd users in the hosts primary domain.
	Therefore, the user <literal>DOMAIN\user1</literal> would be mapped to 
	the account user1 in /etc/passwd instead of allocating a new uid for him or her.
	</para>

	<para>
	This parameter is now deprecated in favor of the newer idmap_nss backend.
	Refer to the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>idmap_nss</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> man page for more information.
