	<para>
	Setting this paramter to <value type="example">no</value> prevents
	winbind from creating custom krb5.conf files. Winbind normally does
	this because the krb5 libraries are not AD-site-aware and thus would
	pick any domain controller out of potentially very many. Winbind
	is site-aware and makes the krb5 libraries use a local DC by
	creating its own krb5.conf files.
	</para>
	<para>
	Preventing winbind from doing this might become necessary if you
	have to add special options into your system-krb5.conf that winbind
	does not see.
