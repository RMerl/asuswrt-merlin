	<para>
	The <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle> <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	daemon maintains an database of file locks obtained by SMB clients. The default behavior is 
	to map this internal database to POSIX locks. This means that file locks obtained by SMB clients are 
	consistent with those seen by POSIX compliant applications accessing the files via a non-SMB 
	method (e.g. NFS or local file access). It is very unlikely that you need to set this parameter
	to "no", unless you are sharing from an NFS mount, which is not a good idea in the first place.
