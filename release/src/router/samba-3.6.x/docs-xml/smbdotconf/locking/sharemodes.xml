	modes are used by clients to gain exclusive read or write access

	<para>This is a deprecated option from old versions of
	Samba, and will be removed in the next major release.

	<para>These open modes are not directly supported by UNIX, so
	they are simulated using shared memory.</para>

	<para>The share modes that are enabled by this option are
	the standard Windows share modes.
	</para>

	<para>This option gives full share compatibility and is enabled
	by default.</para>
