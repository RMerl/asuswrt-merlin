	<para>
	This is an enumerated type that controls the handling of file locking in the server. When this is set to <constant>yes</constant>,
	the server will check every read and write access for file locks, and deny access if locks exist. This can be slow on 
	some systems.
	</para>

	<para>
	When strict locking is set to Auto (the default), the server performs file lock checks only on non-oplocked files.
	As most Windows redirectors perform file locking checks locally on oplocked files this is a good trade off for
	improved performance.
	</para>

	<para>
	When strict locking is disabled, the server performs file lock checks only when the client explicitly asks for them.
	</para>

	<para>
	Well-behaved clients always ask for lock checks when it is important.  So in the vast majority of cases, 
	 <command moreinfo="none">strict locking = Auto</command> or
	 <command moreinfo="none">strict locking = no</command> is acceptable.
