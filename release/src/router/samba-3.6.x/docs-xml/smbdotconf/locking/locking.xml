	<para>This controls whether or not locking will be 
	performed by the server in response to lock requests from the 
	client.</para>

	<para>If <command moreinfo="none">locking = no</command>, all lock and unlock 
	requests will appear to succeed and all lock queries will report 
	that the file in question is available for locking.</para>

	<para>If <command moreinfo="none">locking = yes</command>, real locking will be performed 
	by the server.</para>

	<para>This option <emphasis>may</emphasis> be useful for read-only 
	filesystems which <emphasis>may</emphasis> not need locking (such as 
	CDROM drives), although setting this parameter of <constant>no</constant> 
	is not really recommended even in this case.</para>

	<para>Be careful about disabling locking either globally or in a 
	specific service, as lack of locking may result in data corruption. 
	You should never need to set this parameter.</para>
