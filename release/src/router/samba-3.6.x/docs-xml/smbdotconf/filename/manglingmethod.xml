	<para> controls the algorithm used for the generating
	the mangled names. Can take two different values, &quot;hash&quot; and
	&quot;hash2&quot;. &quot;hash&quot; is the algorithm that was used
	used in Samba for many years and was the default in Samba 2.2.x &quot;hash2&quot; is
        now the default and is newer and considered a better algorithm (generates less collisions) in
        the names. Many Win32 applications store the mangled names and so
	changing to algorithms must not be done lightly as these applications
        may break unless reinstalled.</para>
