	<para>This is a list of files or directories that are not 
	visible but are accessible.  The DOS 'hidden' attribute is applied 
	to any files or directories that match.</para>

	<para>Each entry in the list must be separated by a '/', 
	which allows spaces to be included in the entry.  '*'
	and '?' can be used to specify multiple files or directories 
	as in DOS wildcards.</para>

	<para>Each entry must be a Unix path, not a DOS path and must 
	not include the Unix directory separator '/'.</para>

	<para>Note that the case sensitivity option is applicable 
	in hiding files.</para>
		
	<para>Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, 
	as it will be forced to check all files and directories for a match 
	as they are scanned.</para>

	<para>
	The example shown above is based on files that the Macintosh 
	SMB client (DAVE) available from <ulink url="http://www.thursby.com"> 
	Thursby</ulink> creates for internal use, and also still hides 
	all files beginning with a dot.
	</para>

	<para>
	An example of us of this parameter is:
<programlisting>
hide files = /.*/DesktopFolderDB/TrashFor%m/resource.frk/
</programlisting>
