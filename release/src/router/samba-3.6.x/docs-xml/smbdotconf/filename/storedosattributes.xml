	<para>
	If this parameter is set Samba attempts to first read DOS attributes (SYSTEM, HIDDEN, ARCHIVE or
	READ-ONLY) from a filesystem extended attribute, before mapping DOS attributes to UNIX permission bits (such
	as occurs with <smbconfoption name="map hidden"/> and <smbconfoption name="map readonly"/>).  When set, DOS
	attributes will be stored onto an extended attribute in the UNIX filesystem, associated with the file or
	directory.  For no other mapping to occur as a fall-back, the parameters <smbconfoption name="map hidden"/>,
	<smbconfoption name="map system"/>, <smbconfoption name="map archive"/> and <smbconfoption name="map
	readonly"/> must be set to off.  This parameter writes the DOS attributes as a string into the extended
	attribute named "user.DOSATTRIB". This extended attribute is explicitly hidden from smbd clients requesting an
	EA list. On Linux the filesystem must have been mounted with the mount option user_xattr in order for
	extended attributes to work, also extended attributes must be compiled into the Linux kernel.

	In Samba 3.5.0 and above the "user.DOSATTRIB" extended attribute has been extended to store
	the create time for a file as well as the DOS attributes. This is done in a backwards compatible
	way so files created by Samba 3.5.0 and above can still have the DOS attribute read from this
	extended attribute by earlier versions of Samba, but they will not be able to read the create
	time stored there. Storing the create time separately from the normal filesystem meta-data
	allows Samba to faithfully reproduce NTFS semantics on top of a POSIX filesystem.
