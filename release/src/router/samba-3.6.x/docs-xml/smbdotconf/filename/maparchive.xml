	<para>
	This controls whether the DOS archive attribute 
	should be mapped to the UNIX owner execute bit.  The DOS archive bit 
	is set when a file has been modified since its last backup.  One 
	motivation for this option is to keep Samba/your PC from making 
	any file it touches from becoming executable under UNIX.  This can 
	be quite annoying for shared source code, documents, etc...
	</para>

	<para>
	Note that this requires the <smbconfoption name="create mask"/>	parameter to be set such that owner 
	execute bit is not masked out (i.e. it must include 100). See the parameter 
	<smbconfoption name="create mask"/> for details.
