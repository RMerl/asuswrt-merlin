	<para>
	This controls how the DOS read only attribute should be mapped from a UNIX filesystem.
	</para>

	<para>
	This parameter can take three different values, which tell <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> how to display the read only attribute on files, where either
	<smbconfoption name="store dos attributes"/> is set to <constant>No</constant>, or no extended attribute is
	present. If <smbconfoption name="store dos attributes"/> is set to <constant>yes</constant> then this
	parameter is <emphasis>ignored</emphasis>. This is a new parameter introduced in Samba version 3.0.21.
	</para>

    <para>The three settings are :</para>

    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>
		<constant>Yes</constant> - The read only DOS attribute is mapped to the inverse of the user
		or owner write bit in the unix permission mode set. If the owner write bit is not set, the
		read only attribute is reported as being set on the file.
		If the read only DOS attribute is set, Samba sets the owner, group and
		others write bits to zero. Write bits set in an ACL are ignored by Samba.
		If the read only DOS attribute is unset, Samba simply sets the write bit of the
		owner to one.
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		<constant>Permissions</constant> - The read only DOS attribute is mapped to the effective permissions of
		the connecting user, as evaluated by <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
		<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> by reading the unix permissions and POSIX ACL (if present).
		If the connecting user does not have permission to modify the file, the read only attribute
		is reported as being set on the file.
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		<constant>No</constant> - The read only DOS attribute is unaffected by permissions, and can only be set by
		the <smbconfoption name="store dos attributes"/> method. This may be useful for exporting mounted CDs.
		</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
