	<para>
	This is a list of files and directories that are neither visible nor accessible.  Each entry in 
	the list must be separated by a '/', which allows spaces to be included in the entry. '*' and '?' 
	can be used to specify multiple files or directories as in DOS wildcards.
	</para>

	<para>
	Each entry must be a unix path, not a DOS path and must <emphasis>not</emphasis> include the  
	unix directory 	separator '/'.
	</para>

	<para>
	Note that the <smbconfoption name="case sensitive"/> option is applicable in vetoing files.

	<para>
	One feature of the veto files parameter that it is important to be aware of is Samba's behaviour when
	trying to delete a directory. If a directory that is to be deleted contains nothing but veto files this
	deletion will <emphasis>fail</emphasis> unless you also set the <smbconfoption name="delete veto files"/> 
	parameter to <parameter moreinfo="none">yes</parameter>.
	</para>

	<para>
	Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, as it will be forced to check all files 
	and directories for a match as they are scanned.
	</para>

	<para>
	Examples of use include:
<programlisting>
; Veto any files containing the word Security,
; any ending in .tmp, and any directory containing the
; word root.
veto files = /*Security*/*.tmp/*root*/

; Veto the Apple specific files that a NetAtalk server
; creates.
veto files = /.AppleDouble/.bin/.AppleDesktop/Network Trash Folder/
</programlisting>
