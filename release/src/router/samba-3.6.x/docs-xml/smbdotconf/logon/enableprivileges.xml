	<para>
	This deprecated parameter controls whether or not smbd will honor privileges assigned to specific SIDs via either
	 <command>net rpc rights</command> or one of the Windows user and group manager tools.  This parameter is
	enabled by default. It can be disabled to prevent members of the Domain Admins group from being able to
	assign privileges to users or groups which can then result in certain smbd operations running as root that
	would normally run under the context of the connected user.
	</para>

	<para>
	An example of how privileges can be used is to assign the right to join clients to a Samba controlled
	domain without providing root access to the server via smbd.
	</para>

	<para>
	Please read the extended description provided in the Samba HOWTO documentation.
