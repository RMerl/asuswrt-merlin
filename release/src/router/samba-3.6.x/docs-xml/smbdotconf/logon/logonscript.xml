	<para>
	This parameter specifies the batch file (<filename>.bat</filename>) or NT command file
	(<filename>.cmd</filename>) to be downloaded and run on a machine when a user successfully logs in.  The file
	must contain the DOS style CR/LF line endings. Using a DOS-style editor to create the file is recommended.
	</para>
		
	<para>
	The script must be a relative path to the <smbconfsection name="[netlogon]"/> service.  If the [netlogon]
	service specifies a <smbconfoption name="path"/> of <filename
	moreinfo="none">/usr/local/samba/netlogon</filename>, and <smbconfoption name="logon
	script">STARTUP.BAT</smbconfoption>, then the file that will be downloaded is:
<programlisting>
	/usr/local/samba/netlogon/STARTUP.BAT
</programlisting>
	</para>

	<para>
	The contents of the batch file are entirely your choice.  A suggested command would be to add <command
	moreinfo="none">NET TIME \\SERVER /SET /YES</command>, to force every machine to synchronize clocks with the
	same time server.  Another use would be to add <command moreinfo="none">NET USE U: \\SERVER\UTILS</command>
	for commonly used utilities, or 
<programlisting>
<userinput>NET USE Q: \\SERVER\ISO9001_QA</userinput>
</programlisting> 
	for example.
	</para>

	<para>
	Note that it is particularly important not to allow write access to the [netlogon] share, or to grant users
	write permission on the batch files in a secure environment, as this would allow the batch files to be
	arbitrarily modified and security to be breached.	
	</para>

	<para>
	This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or
	machine.
	</para>

	<para>
	This option is only useful if Samba is set up as a logon server.
	</para>
