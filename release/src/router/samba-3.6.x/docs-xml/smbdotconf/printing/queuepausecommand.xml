    <para>This parameter specifies the command to be 
    executed on the server host in order to pause the printer queue.</para>

    <para>This command should be a program or script which takes 
    a printer name as its only parameter and stops the printer queue, 
    such that no longer jobs are submitted to the printer.</para>

    <para>This command is not supported by Windows for Workgroups, 
    but can be issued from the Printers window under Windows 95 
    and NT.</para>
		
    <para>If a <parameter moreinfo="none">%p</parameter> is given then the printer name 
    is put in its place. Otherwise it is placed at the end of the command.
    </para>

    <para>Note that it is good practice to include the absolute 
    path in the command as the PATH may not be available to the 
	server.</para>
