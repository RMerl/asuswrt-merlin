    <para>This parameter applies only to Windows NT/2000
    clients.  It has no effect on Windows 95/98/ME clients.  When 
    serving a printer to Windows NT/2000 clients without first installing
    a valid printer driver on the Samba host, the client will be required
    to install a local printer driver.  From this point on, the client
    will treat the print as a local printer and not a network printer 
    connection.  This is much the same behavior that will occur
    when <command moreinfo="none">disable spoolss = yes</command>.
    </para>

    <para>The differentiating  factor is that under normal
    circumstances, the NT/2000 client will  attempt to open the network
    printer using MS-RPC.  The problem is that because the client
    considers the printer to be local, it will attempt to issue the
    OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated  with the
    logged on user. If the user possesses local administator rights but
    not root privilege on the Samba host (often the case), the
    OpenPrinterEx() call will fail.  The result is that the client will
    now display an &quot;Access Denied; Unable to connect&quot; message
    in the printer queue window (even though jobs may successfully be
    printed).  </para>

    <para>If this parameter is enabled for a printer, then any attempt
    to open the printer with the PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER right is mapped
    to PRINTER_ACCESS_USE instead.  Thus allowing the OpenPrinterEx()
    call to succeed.  <emphasis>This parameter MUST not be enabled
    on a print share which has valid print driver installed on the Samba 
	server.</emphasis></para>
