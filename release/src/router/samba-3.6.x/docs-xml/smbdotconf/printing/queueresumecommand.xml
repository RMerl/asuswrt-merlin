    <para>This parameter specifies the command to be 
    executed on the server host in order to resume the printer queue. It 
    is the command to undo the behavior that is caused by the 
    previous parameter (<smbconfoption name="queuepause command"/>).</para>
 
    <para>This command should be a program or script which takes 
    a printer name as its only parameter and resumes the printer queue, 
    such that queued jobs are resubmitted to the printer.</para>

    <para>This command is not supported by Windows for Workgroups, 
    but can be issued from the Printers window under Windows 95 
    and NT.</para>

    <para>If a <parameter moreinfo="none">%p</parameter> is given then the printer name 
    is put in its place. Otherwise it is placed at the end of the 
    command.</para>

    <para>Note that it is good practice to include the absolute 
    path in the command as the PATH may not be available to the 
	server.</para>
