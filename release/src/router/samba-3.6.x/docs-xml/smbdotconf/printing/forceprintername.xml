<description>
    <para>When printing from Windows NT (or later), 
    each printer in <filename>smb.conf</filename> has two 
    associated names which can be used by the client.  The first
    is the sharename (or shortname) defined in smb.conf.  This
    is the only printername available for use by Windows 9x clients.
    The second name associated with a printer can be seen when 
    browsing to the "Printers" (or "Printers and Faxes") folder 
    on the Samba server.  This is referred to simply as the printername
    (not to be confused with the <parameter>printer name</parameter> option).
    </para>

    <para>When assigning a new driver to a printer on a remote 
    Windows compatible print server such as Samba, the Windows client
    will rename the printer to match the driver name just uploaded.
    This can result in confusion for users when multiple 
    printers are bound to the same driver.  To prevent Samba from
    allowing the printer's printername to differ from the sharename
    defined in smb.conf, set <parameter>force printername = yes</parameter>.
    </para>

    <para>Be aware that enabling this parameter may affect migrating
    printers from a Windows server to Samba since Windows has no way to 
    force the sharename and printername to match.</para>

    <para>It is recommended that this parameter's value not be changed
    once the printer is in use by clients as this could cause a user
    not be able to delete printer connections from their local Printers 
    folder.</para>
