    <para>This parameter specifies the command to be 
    executed on the server host in order to obtain <command moreinfo="none">lpq
    </command>-style printer status information.</para>

    <para>This command should be a program or script which 
    takes a printer name as its only parameter and outputs printer 
    status information.</para>

    <para>Currently nine styles of printer status information 
    are supported; BSD, AIX, LPRNG, PLP, SYSV, HPUX, QNX, CUPS, and SOFTQ. 
    This covers most UNIX systems. You control which type is expected 
    using the <parameter moreinfo="none">printing =</parameter> option.</para>

    <para>Some clients (notably Windows for Workgroups) may not 
    correctly send the connection number for the printer they are 
    requesting status information about. To get around this, the 
    server reports on the first printer service connected to by the 
    client. This only happens if the connection number sent is invalid.</para>

    <para>If a <parameter moreinfo="none">%p</parameter> is given then the printer name 
    is put in its place. Otherwise it is placed at the end of the 
    command.</para>

    <para>Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path 
    in the <parameter moreinfo="none">lpq command</parameter> as the <envar>$PATH
    </envar> may not be available to the server.  When compiled with
    the CUPS libraries, no <parameter moreinfo="none">lpq command</parameter> is
    needed because smbd will make a library call to obtain the 
	print queue listing.</para>
