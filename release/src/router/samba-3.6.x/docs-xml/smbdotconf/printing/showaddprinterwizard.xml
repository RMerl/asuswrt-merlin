    <para>With the introduction of MS-RPC based printing support
    for Windows NT/2000 client in Samba 2.2, a &quot;Printers...&quot; folder will 
    appear on Samba hosts in the share listing.  Normally this folder will 
    contain an icon for the MS Add Printer Wizard (APW).  However, it is 
    possible to disable this feature regardless of the level of privilege 
    of the connected user.</para>
		
    <para>Under normal circumstances, the Windows NT/2000 client will 
    open a handle on the printer server with OpenPrinterEx() asking for
    Administrator privileges.  If the user does not have administrative
    access on the print server (i.e is not root or a member of the 
    <parameter moreinfo="none">printer admin</parameter> group), the OpenPrinterEx() 
    call fails and the client makes another open call with a request for 
    a lower privilege level.  This should succeed, however the APW 
    icon will not be displayed.</para>
		
    <para>Disabling the <parameter moreinfo="none">show add printer wizard</parameter>
    parameter will always cause the OpenPrinterEx() on the server
	to fail.  Thus the APW icon will never be displayed. 
</para>
<note><para>This does not prevent the same user from having 
		administrative privilege on an individual printer.</para></note>
