    <para>Enabling this parameter will disable Samba's support
    for the SPOOLSS set of MS-RPC's and will yield identical behavior
    as Samba 2.0.x.  Windows NT/2000 clients will downgrade to using
    Lanman style printing commands. Windows 9x/ME will be unaffected by
    the parameter. However, this will also disable the ability to upload
    printer drivers to a Samba server via the Windows NT Add Printer
    Wizard or by using the NT printer properties dialog window.  It will
    also disable the capability of Windows NT/2000 clients to download
    print drivers from the Samba host upon demand.
    <emphasis>Be very careful about enabling this parameter.</emphasis>
