<description>
    <para>With the introduction of MS-RPC based printer
    support for Windows NT/2000 clients in Samba 2.2, it is now 
    possible to delete a printer at run time by issuing the
    DeletePrinter() RPC call.</para>
		
    <para>For a Samba host this means that the printer must be 
    physically deleted from the underlying printing system.  The
    <smbconfoption name="deleteprinter command"/> defines a script to be run which 
    will perform the necessary operations for removing the printer
    from the print system and from <filename moreinfo="none">smb.conf</filename>.
    </para>
		
    <para>The <smbconfoption name="deleteprinter command"/> is 
    automatically called with only one parameter: <smbconfoption name="printer name"/>.
	</para>
		
    <para>Once the <smbconfoption name="deleteprinter command"/> has 
    been executed, <command moreinfo="none">smbd</command> will reparse the <filename moreinfo="none">
    smb.conf</filename> to check that the associated printer no longer exists.
    If the sharename is still valid, then <command moreinfo="none">smbd
    </command> will return an ACCESS_DENIED error to the client.</para>
