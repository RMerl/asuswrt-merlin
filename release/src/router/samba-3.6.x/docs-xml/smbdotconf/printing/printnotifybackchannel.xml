<description>
<para>Windows print clients can update print queue status by expecting
	the server to open a backchannel SMB connection to them. Due to
	client firewall settings this can cause considerable timeouts
	and will often fail, as there is no guarantee the client is even
	running an SMB server. By setting this parameter to <constant>no</constant>
	the Samba print server will not try to connect back to clients
	and treat corresponding requests as if the connection back to
	the client failed. The default setting of <constant>yes</constant>
	causes smbd to attempt this connection.
