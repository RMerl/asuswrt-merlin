<description>
	<para>This controls how long lpq info will be cached 
	for to prevent the <command moreinfo="none">lpq</command> command being called too 
	often. A separate cache is kept for each variation of the <command moreinfo="none">
	lpq</command> command used by the system, so if you use different 
	<command moreinfo="none">lpq</command> commands for different users then they won't
	share cache information.</para>

	<para>The cache files are stored in <filename moreinfo="none">/tmp/lpq.xxxx</filename> 
	where xxxx is a hash of the <command moreinfo="none">lpq</command> command in use.</para>

	<para>The default is 30 seconds, meaning that the cached results 
	of a previous identical <command moreinfo="none">lpq</command> command will be used 
	if the cached data is less than 30 seconds old. A large value may 
	be advisable if your <command moreinfo="none">lpq</command> command is very slow.</para>

<para>A value of 0 will disable caching completely.</para>
