	<para>
	When Samba is asked to write to a read-only LDAP replica, we are redirected to talk to the read-write master server.
	This server then replicates our changes back to the 'local' server, however the replication might take some seconds, 
	especially over slow links.  Certain client activities, particularly domain joins, can become confused by the 'success' 
	that does not immediately change the LDAP back-end's data.
	</para>
        
	<para>
	This option simply causes Samba to wait a short time, to allow the LDAP server to catch up.  If you have a particularly
	high-latency network, you may wish to time the LDAP replication with a network sniffer, and increase this value accordingly.  
	Be aware that no checking is performed that the data has actually replicated.

        <para>
	The value is specified in milliseconds, the maximum value is 5000 (5 seconds).
