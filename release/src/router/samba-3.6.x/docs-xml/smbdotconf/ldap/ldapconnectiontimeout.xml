	<para>
	This parameter tells the LDAP library calls which timeout in seconds
	they should honor during initial connection establishments to LDAP servers.
	It is very useful in failover scenarios in particular. If one or more LDAP
	servers are not reachable at all, we do not have to wait until TCP
	timeouts are over. This feature must be supported by your LDAP library.
	</para>

	<para>
	This parameter is different from <smbconfoption name="ldap timeout"/>
	which affects operations on LDAP servers using an existing connection
	and not establishing an initial connection.
