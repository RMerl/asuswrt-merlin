	<para>Specifies that <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nmbd</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> when acting as a WINS server and 
	finding that a NetBIOS name has not been registered, should treat the 
	NetBIOS name word-for-word as a DNS name and do a lookup with the DNS server 
	for that name on behalf of the name-querying client.</para>

	<para>Note that the maximum length for a NetBIOS name is 15 
	characters, so the DNS name (or DNS alias) can likewise only be 
	15 characters, maximum.</para>

	<para><command moreinfo="none">nmbd</command> spawns a second copy of itself to do the
	DNS name lookup requests, as doing a name lookup is a blocking 
	action.</para>
