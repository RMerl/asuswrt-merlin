	<para>When Samba is running as a WINS server this 
	allows you to call an external program for all changes to the 
	WINS database. The primary use for this option is to allow the 
	dynamic update of external name resolution databases such as 
	dynamic DNS.</para>

	<para>The wins hook parameter specifies the name of a script 
	or executable that will be called as follows:</para>

	<para><command moreinfo="none">wins_hook operation name nametype ttl IP_list</command></para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>The first argument is the operation and is
			one  of &quot;add&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, or
			&quot;refresh&quot;. In most cases the operation
			can  be ignored as the rest of the parameters
			provide sufficient  information. Note that
			&quot;refresh&quot; may sometimes be called when
			the  name has not previously been added, in that
			case it should be treated  as an add.</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>The second argument is the NetBIOS name. If the 
			name is not a legal name then the wins hook is not called. 
			Legal names contain only  letters, digits, hyphens, underscores 
			and periods.</para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>The third argument is the NetBIOS name 
			type as a 2 digit hexadecimal number. </para>
		</listitem>

		<listitem>
			<para>The fourth argument is the TTL (time to live) 
			for the name in seconds.</para>
		</listitem>
			
		<listitem>
			<para>The fifth and subsequent arguments are the IP 
			addresses currently registered for that name. If this list is 
			empty then the name should be deleted.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>An example script that calls the BIND dynamic DNS update 
	program <command moreinfo="none">nsupdate</command> is provided in the examples 
	directory of the Samba source code. </para>
