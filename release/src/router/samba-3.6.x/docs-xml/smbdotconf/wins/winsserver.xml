	<para>This specifies the IP address (or DNS name: IP 
	address for preference) of the WINS server that <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nmbd</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> should register with. If you have a WINS server on 
	your network then you should set this to the WINS server's IP.</para>

	<para>You should point this at your WINS server if you have a
	multi-subnetted network.</para>

	<para>If you want to work in multiple namespaces, you can 
	give every wins server a 'tag'. For each tag, only one 
	(working) server will be queried for a name. The tag should be 
	separated from the ip address by a colon.
	</para>

	<note><para>You need to set up Samba to point 
	to a WINS server if you have multiple subnets and wish cross-subnet 
	browsing to work correctly.</para></note>
	<para>See the chapter in the Samba3-HOWTO on Network Browsing.</para>

	<comment>For this example when querying a certain name, 192.19.200.1 will 
	be asked first and if that doesn't respond 192.168.2.61. If either 
	of those doesn't know the name 192.168.3.199 will be queried.</comment></value>
