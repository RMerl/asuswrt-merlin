	<refpurpose>Samba's idmap_ad Backend for Winbind</refpurpose>
</refnamediv>

<refsynopsisdiv>
	<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
	<para>The idmap_ad plugin provides a way for Winbind to read
	id mappings from an AD server that uses RFC2307/SFU schema
	extensions. This module implements only the &quot;idmap&quot;
	API, and is READONLY. Mappings must be provided in advance
	by the administrator by adding the uidNumber attributes for
	users and gidNumber attributes for groups in the AD. Winbind
	will only map users that have a uidNumber and whose primary
	group have a gidNumber attribute set. It is however
	recommended that all groups in use have gidNumber attributes
	assigned, otherwise they are not working.</para>

	<para>
	Note that the idmap_ad module has changed considerably since
	Samba versions 3.0 and 3.2.
	Currently, the <parameter>ad</parameter> backend
	does not work as the the default idmap backend, but one has
	to configure it separately for each domain for which one wants
	to use it, using disjoint ranges. One usually needs to configure
	a writeable default idmap range, using for example the
	<parameter>tdb</parameter> or <parameter>ldap</parameter>
	backend, in order to be able to map the BUILTIN sids and
	possibly other trusted domains. The writeable default config
	is also needed in order to be able to create group mappings.
	This catch-all default idmap configuration should have a range
	that is disjoint from any explicitly configured domain with
	idmap backend <parameter>ad</parameter>. See the example below.

		<varlistentry>
		<term>range = low - high</term>
		<listitem><para>
			Defines the available matching UID and GID range for which the
			backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter.
			If specified any UID or GID stored in AD that fall outside the
			range is ignored and the corresponding map is discarded.
			It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps
			between local and remotely defined IDs.

		<listitem><para>
			Defines the schema that idmap_ad should use when querying
			Active Directory regarding user and group information.
			This can be either the RFC2307 schema support included
			in Windows 2003 R2 or the Service for Unix (SFU) schema.

	<title>EXAMPLES</title>
	<para>
	The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings from our principal and
	trusted AD domains. If trusted domains are present id conflicts must be
	resolved beforehand, there is no
	guarantee on the order conflicting mappings would be resolved at this point.

	This example also shows how to leave a small non conflicting range for local
	id allocation that may be used in internal backends like BUILTIN.

	The original Samba software and related utilities
	were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
	by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar
	to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
