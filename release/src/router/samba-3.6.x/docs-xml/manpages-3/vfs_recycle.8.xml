	<title>DESCRIPTION</title>

	<para>This VFS module is part of the
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>samba</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry> suite.</para>

	<para>The <command>vfs_recycle</command> intercepts file deletion
	requests and moves the affected files to a temporary repository
	rather than deleting them immediately. This gives the same effect
	as the Recycle Bin on Windows computers. </para>

	<para>The Recycle Bin will not appear in Windows Explorer
	views of the network file system (share) nor on any mapped
	drive. Instead, a directory called .recycle will be automatically
	created when the first file is deleted and recycle:repository is
	not configured. If recycle:repository is configured, the name
	of the created directory depends on recycle:repository. Users
	can recover files from the recycle bin. If the recycle:keeptree
	option has been specified, deleted files will be found in a path
	identical with that from which the file was deleted.  </para>


	<para>This module is stackable.</para>

		<listitem>
		<para>Set MODE to the octal mode with which
