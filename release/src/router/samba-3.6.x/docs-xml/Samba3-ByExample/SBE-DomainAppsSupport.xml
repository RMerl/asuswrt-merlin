	You've come a long way now. You have pretty much mastered Samba-3 for 
	most uses it can be put to. Up until now, you have cast Samba-3 in the leading 
	role, and where authentication was required, you have used one or another of 
	Samba's many authentication backends (from flat text files with smbpasswd 
	to LDAP directory integration with ldapsam). Now you can design a 
	solution for a new Abmas business. This business is running Windows Server 
	2003 and Active Directory, and these are to stay. It's time to master 
	implementing Samba and Samba-supported services in a domain controlled by 
	the latest Windows authentication technologies. Let's get started &smbmdash; this is 
	leading edge.
	</para>

<sect1>
	<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>
	Abmas has continued its miraculous growth; indeed, nothing seems to be able 
	to stop its diversification into multiple (and seemingly unrelated) fields. 
	Its latest acquisition is Abmas Snack Foods, a big player in the snack-food 
	business.
	</para>

	<para>
	With this acquisition comes new challenges for you and your team. Abmas Snack 
	Foods is a well-developed business with a huge and heterogeneous network. It 
	already has Windows, NetWare, and Proprietary UNIX, but as yet no Samba or Linux. 
	The network is mature and well-established, and there is no question of its chosen 
	user authentication scheme being changed for now. You need to take a wise new 
	approach.
	</para>

	<para>
	You have decided to set the ball rolling by introducing Samba-3 into the network 
	gradually, taking over key services and easing the way to a full migration and, 
	therefore, integration into Abmas's existing business later.

	        You've promised the skeptical Abmas Snack Foods management team 
		that you can show them how Samba can ease itself and other Open Source 
		technologies into their existing infrastructure and deliver sound business 
		advantages. Cost cutting is high on their agenda (a major promise of the 
		acquisition). You have chosen Web proxying and caching as your proving ground.
		</para>

		<para>
		<indexterm><primary>bandwidth</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>Microsoft ISA</primary></indexterm>
		Abmas Snack Foods has several thousand users housed at its head office 
		and multiple regional offices, plants, and warehouses. A high proportion of 
		the business's work is done online, so Internet access for most of these 
		users is essential. All Internet access, including for all regional offices, 
		is funneled through the head office and is the job of the (now your) networking 
		team. The bandwidth requirements were horrific (comparable to a small ISP), and 
		the team soon discovered proxying and caching. In fact, they became one of 
		the earliest commercial users of Microsoft ISA.
		</para>

		<para>
		<indexterm><primary>Active Directory</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>authenticated</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>proxy</primary></indexterm>
		The team is not happy with ISA. Because it never lived up to its marketing promises, 
		it underperformed and had reliability problems. You have pounced on the opportunity 
		to show what Open Source can do. The one thing they do like, however, is ISA's 
		integration with Active Directory. They like that their users, once logged on, 
		are automatically authenticated against the proxy. If your alternative to ISA 
		can operate completely seamlessly in their Active Directory domain, it will be
		approved.
		</para>

		<para>
		This is a hands-on exercise. You build software applications so
		that you obtain the functionality Abmas needs.

		Functionally, the user's Internet Explorer requests a browsing session with the 
		Squid proxy, for which it offers its AD authentication token. Squid hands off 
		the authentication request to the Samba-3 authentication helper application
		called <command>ntlm_auth</command>. This helper is a hook into winbind, the 
		Samba-3 NTLM authentication daemon. Winbind enables UNIX services to authenticate 
		against Microsoft Windows domains, including Active Directory domains. As Active 
		Directory authentication is a modified Kerberos authentication, winbind is assisted 
		in this by local Kerberos 5 libraries configured to check passwords with the Active 
		Directory server. Once the token has been checked, a browsing session is established. 
		This process is entirely transparent and seamless to the user.

	Officially, neither MIT (1.3.4) nor Heimdal (0.63) Kerberos needs an <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> 
	file in order to work correctly. All ADS domains automatically create SRV records in the 
	DNS zone <constant>Kerberos.REALM.NAME</constant> for each KDC in the realm. Since both 
	MIT and Heimdal, KRB5 libraries default to checking for these records, so they 
	automatically find the KDCs. In addition, <filename>krb5.conf</filename> allows 
	specifying only a single KDC, even if there is more than one. Using the DNS lookup 
	allows the KRB5 libraries to use whichever KDCs are available.

		The following gotchas often catch people out. Kerberos is case sensitive. Your realm must
		be in UPPERCASE, or you will get an error: <quote>Cannot find KDC for requested realm while getting
		initial credentials</quote>.  Kerberos is picky about time synchronization. The time
		according to your participating servers must be within 5 minutes or you get an error:
		<quote>kinit(v5): Clock skew too great while getting initial credentials</quote>.
		Clock skew limits are, in fact, configurable in the Kerberos protocols (the default is
		5 minutes). A better solution is to implement NTP throughout your server network.
		Kerberos needs to be able to do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address of your KDC.
		Also, the name that this reverse lookup maps to must either be the NetBIOS name of
		the KDC (i.e., the hostname with no domain attached) or the
		NetBIOS name followed by the realm. If all else fails, you can add a
		<filename>/etc/hosts</filename> entry mapping the IP address of your KDC to its
		NetBIOS name. If Kerberos cannot do this reverse lookup, you will get a local error
		when you try to join the realm.

		Microsoft Windows networking protocols permeate the spectrum of technologies that Microsoft
		Windows clients use, even when accessing traditional services such as Web browsers. Depending 
		on whom you discuss this with, this is either good or bad. No matter how you might evaluate this,
		the use of NTLMSSP as the authentication protocol for Web proxy access has some advantages over
		the cookie-based authentication regime used by all competing browsers. It is Samba's implementation
		of NTLMSSP that makes it attractive to implement the solution that has been demonstrated in this chapter.

	<indexterm><primary>SambaXP conference</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>Goettingen</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>Italian</primary></indexterm>
	The development of the <command>ntlm_auth</command> module was first discussed in many Open Source circles
	in 2002. At the SambaXP conference in Goettingen, Germany, Mr. Francesco Chemolli demonstrated the use of 
	<command>ntlm_auth</command> during one of the late developer meetings that took place. Since that time, the 
	adoption of <command>ntlm_auth</command> has spread considerably.
	</para>

	<para>
	The largest report from a site that uses Squid with <command>ntlm_auth</command>-based authentication
	support uses a dual processor server that has 2 GB of memory. It provides Web and FTP proxy services for 10,000
	users. Approximately 2,000 of these users make heavy use of the proxy services. According to the source, who
	wishes to remain anonymous, the sustained transaction load on this server hovers around 140 hits/sec. The following
	comments were made with respect to questions regarding the performance of this installation:
	</para>

	<blockquote><para>
	[In our] EXTREMELY optimized environment . . . [the] performance impact is almost [nothing]. The <quote>almost</quote> 
	part is due to the brain damage of the ntlm-over-http protocol definition. Suffice to say that its worst-case 
	scenario triples the number of hits needed to perform the same transactions versus basic or digest auth[entication].
	</para></blockquote>

	<para>
	You would be well-advised to recognize that all cache-intensive proxying solutions demand a lot of memory.
	Make certain that your Squid proxy server is equipped with sufficient memory to permit all proxy operations to run 
	out of memory without invoking the overheads involved in the use of memory that has to be swapped to disk.

		To provide transparent interoperability between Windows clients and the network services
		that are used from them, Samba had to develop tools and facilities that deliver that feature. The benefit
		of Open Source software is that it can readily be reused. The current <command>ntlm_auth</command>
		module is basically a wrapper around authentication code from the core of the Samba project.

		<indexterm><primary>Apache Web server</primary></indexterm>
		The <command>ntlm_auth</command> module supports basic plain-text authentication and NTLMSSP 
		protocols. This module makes it possible for Web and FTP proxy requests to be authenticated without
		the user being interrupted via his or her Windows logon credentials. This facility is available with
		MS Windows Explorer and is one of the key benefits claimed for Microsoft Internet Information Server.
		There are a few open source initiatives to provide support for these protocols in the Apache Web server
		also.
		</para>

		<para>
		<indexterm><primary>wrapper</primary></indexterm>
		The short answer is that by adding a wrapper around key authentication components of Samba, other
		projects (like Squid) can benefit from the labors expended in meeting user interoperability needs.

	<question>

		<para>
		Does use of Samba (<command>ntlm_auth</command>) improve the performance of Squid?
		</para>

	</question>
	<answer>

		<para>
		Not really. Samba's <command>ntlm_auth</command> module handles only authentication. It requires that
		Squid make an external call to <command>ntlm_auth</command> and therefore actually incurs a
		little more overhead. Compared with the benefit obtained, that overhead is well worth enduring. Since
		Squid is a proxy server, and proxy servers tend to require lots of memory, it is good advice to provide
		sufficient memory when using Squid. Just add a little more to accommodate <command>ntlm_auth</command>.
