  <title>Preface</title>

	<para>
	Network administrators live busy lives. We face distractions and pressures
	that drive us to seek proven, working case scenarios that can be easily
	implemented. Often this approach lands us in trouble. There is a 
	saying that, geometrically speaking, the shortest distance between two 
	points is a straight line, but practically we find that the quickest 
	route to a stable network solution is the long way around.
	</para>

	<para>
	This book is your means to the straight path. It provides step-by-step,
	proven, working examples of Samba deployments.  If you want to deploy
	Samba-3 with the least effort, or if you want to become an expert at deploying
	Samba-3 without having to search through lots of documentation, this
	book is the ticket to your destination.
	</para>

	<para>
	Samba is software that can be run on a platform other than Microsoft Windows,
	for example, UNIX, Linux, IBM System 390, OpenVMS, and other operating systems.
	Samba uses the TCP/IP protocol that is installed on the host server. When
	correctly configured, it allows that host to interact with a Microsoft Windows
	client or server as if it is a Windows file and print server. This book
	will help you to implement Windows-compatible file and print services.
	</para>

	<para>
	The examples presented in this book are typical of various businesses and
	reflect the problems and challenges they face. Care has been taken to preserve
	attitudes, perceptions, practices, and demands from real network case studies.
	The maximum benefit may be obtained from this book by working carefully through
	each exercise. You may be in a hurry to satisfy a specific need, so feel
	free to locate the example that most closely matches your need, copy it, and
	innovate as much as you like. Above all, enjoy the process of learning the
	secrets of MS Windows networking that is truly liberated by Samba.
	</para>

	<para>
	The focus of attention in this book is Samba-3. Specific notes are made in
	respect of how Samba may be made secure. This book does not attempt to provide
	detailed information regarding secure operation and configuration of peripheral
	services and applications such as OpenLDAP, DNS and DHCP, the need for which
	can be met from other resources that are dedicated to the subject.
	</para>

  <sect1>
	<title>Why Is This Book Necessary?</title>

	<para>
	This book is the result of observations and feedback. The feedback from
	the Samba-HOWTO-Collection has been positive and complimentary. There
	have been requests for far more worked examples, a
	<quote>Samba Cookbook,</quote> and for training materials to
	help kick-start the process of mastering Samba.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Samba mailing lists users have asked for sample configuration files
	that work. It is natural to question one's own ability to correctly
	configure a complex tool such as Samba until a minimum necessary
	knowledge level has been attained.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Samba-HOWTO-Collection &smbmdash; as does <emphasis>The Official Samba-3 HOWTO and 
	Reference Guide</emphasis> &smbmdash; documents Samba features and functionality in
	a topical context.  This book takes a completely different approach. It
	walks through Samba network configurations that are working within particular
	environmental contexts, providing documented step-by-step implementations.
	All example case configuration files, scripts, and other tools are provided
	on the CD-ROM. This book is descriptive, provides detailed diagrams, and
	makes deployment of Samba-3 a breeze.
	</para>

	<sect2>
	<title>Samba 3.0.20 Update Edition</title>

	<para>
	The Samba 3.0.x series has been remarkably popular. At the time this book first
	went to print samba-3.0.2 was being released. There have been significant modifications
	and enhancements between samba-3.0.2 and samba-3.0.14 (the current release) that
	necessitate this documentation update. This update has the specific intent to
	refocus this book so that its guidance can be followed for samba-3.0.20
	and beyond. Further changes are expected as Samba-3 matures further and will 
	be reflected in future updates.
	</para>

	<para>
	The changes shown in <link linkend="pref-new"/> are incorporated in this update.

  <title>Prerequisites</title>

	<para>
	This book is not a tutorial on UNIX or Linux administration. UNIX and Linux
	training is best obtained from books dedicated to the subject. This book
	assumes that you have at least the basic skill necessary to use these operating
	systems, and that you can use a basic system editor to edit and configure files.
	It has been written with the assumption that you have experience with Samba, 
	have read <emphasis>The Official Samba-3 HOWTO and Reference Guide</emphasis> and
	the Samba-HOWTO-Collection, or that you have familiarity with Microsoft Windows.
	</para>

	<para>
	If you do not have this experience, you can follow the examples in this book but may
	find yourself at times intimidated by assumptions made. In this situation, you
	may need to refer to administrative guides or manuals for your operating system
	platform to find what is the best method to achieve what the text of this book describes.
	</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
	<title>Approach</title>

	<para>
	The first chapter deals with some rather thorny network analysis issues. Do not be
	put off by this. The information you glean, even without a detailed understanding
	of network protocol analysis, can help you understand how Windows networking functions.
	</para>

	<para>
	Each following chapter of this book opens with the description of a networking solution
	sought by a hypothetical site. Bob Jordan is a hypothetical decision maker
	for an imaginary company, <constant>Abmas Biz NL</constant>. We will use the
	non-existent domain name <constant>abmas.biz</constant>. All <emphasis>facts</emphasis> 
	presented regarding this company are fictitious and have been drawn from a variety of real 
	business scenarios over many years. Not one of these reveal the identify of the 
	real-world company from which the scenario originated.
	</para>

	<para> 
	In any case, Mr. Jordan likes to give all his staff nasty little assignments.
	Stanley Saroka is one of his proteges; Christine Roberson is the network administrator 
	Bob trusts. Jordan is inclined to treat other departments well because they finance 
	Abmas IT operations.
	</para>

	<para>
	Each chapter presents a summary of the network solution we have chosen to
	demonstrate together with a rationale to help you to understand the
	thought process that drove that solution. The chapter then documents in precise
	detail all configuration files and steps that must be taken to implement the
	example solution. Anyone wishing to gain serious value from this book will
	do well to take note of the implications of points made, so watch out for the
	<emphasis>this means that</emphasis> notations.
	</para>

	<para>
	Each chapter has a set of questions and answers to help you to
	to understand and digest key attributes of the solutions presented.
	</para>

  </sect1>

	<title>Summary of Topics</title>

	<para>
	The contents of this second edition of <emphasis>Samba-3 by Example</emphasis>
	have been rearranged based on feedback from purchasers of the first edition.
	</para>

	<para>
	Clearly the first edition contained most of what was needed and that was missing
	from other books that cover this difficult subject. The new arrangement adds
	additional material to meet consumer requests and includes changes that originated
	as suggestions for improvement.
	</para>

	<para>
	Chapter 1 now dives directly into the heart of the implementation of Windows
	file and print server networks that use Samba at the heart.
	</para>

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
		<term>Chapter 1 &smbmdash; No Frills Samba Servers.</term><listitem>
		<para>
		Here you design a solution for three different business scenarios, each for a 
		company called Abmas. There are two simple networking problems and one slightly 
		more complex networking challenge. In the first two cases, Abmas has a small 
		simple office, and they want to replace a Windows 9x peer-to-peer network. The 
		third example business uses Windows 2000 Professional. This must be simple, 
		so let's see how far we can get. If successful, Abmas grows quickly and
		soon needs to replace all servers and workstations.

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Case 1: The simplest &smb.conf; file that may

					<filename>smbpasswd</filename> file.
					</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para>Case 2: Another simple &smb.conf; file that adds
					WINS support and printing support. This case deals with

					configuration uses Share Mode security and also works with
					Samba-2.x. Encrypted passwords are not used, so there is no
					<filename>smbpasswd</filename> file.
					</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para>Case 3: This &smb.conf; configuration uses User Mode
					security. The file share configuration demonstrates

		<term>Chapter 2 &smbmdash; Small Office Networking.</term><listitem>
		<para>
		Abmas is a successful company now. They have 50 network users
		and want a little more varoom from the network. This is a typical
		small office and they want better systems to help them to grow. This is
		your chance to really give advanced users a bit more functionality and usefulness.
		</para>

		<para><emphasis>TechInfo</emphasis> &smbmdash; This &smb.conf; file
		makes use of encrypted passwords, so there is an <filename>smbpasswd</filename>
		file. It also demonstrates use of the <parameter>valid users</parameter> and
		<parameter>valid groups</parameter> to restrict share access. The Windows
		clients access the server as Domain members. Mobile users log onto
		the Domain while in the office, but use a local machine account while on the
		road. The result is an environment that answers mobile computing user needs.

		</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		<term>Chapter 3 &smbmdash; Secure Office Networking.</term><listitem>
		<para>
		Abmas is growing rapidly now. Money is a little tight, but with 130
		network users, security has become a concern. They have many new machines
		to install and the old equipment will be retired. This time they want the
		new network to scale and grow for at least two years. Start with a sufficient
		system and allow room for growth. You are now implementing an Internet
		connection and have a few reservations about user expectations.
		</para>

		<para><emphasis>TechInfo</emphasis> &smbmdash; This &smb.conf; file
                makes use of encrypted passwords, and you can use a <filename>tdbsam</filename>
                password backend. Domain logons are introduced. Applications are served from the central
		server. Roaming profiles are mandated. Access to the server is tightened up
		so that only domain members can access server resources. Mobile computing
		needs still are catered to.

		<term>Chapter 4 &smbmdash; The 500 User Office.</term><listitem>
		<para>
		The two-year projections were met. Congratulations, you are a star.
		Now Abmas needs to replace the network. Into the existing user base, they
		need to merge a 280-user company they just acquired. It is time to build a serious
		network. There are now three buildings on one campus and your assignment is 
		to keep everyone working while a new network is rolled out. Oh, isn't it nice 
		to roll out brand new clients and servers! Money is no longer tight, you get 
		to buy and install what you ask for. You will install routers and a firewall.
		This is exciting!
		</para>

		<para><emphasis>TechInfo</emphasis> &smbmdash; This &smb.conf; file
                makes use of encrypted passwords, and a <filename>tdbsam</filename>
		password backend is used. You are not ready to launch into LDAP yet, so you
		accept the limitation of having one central Domain Controller with a Domain
		Member server in two buildings on your campus. A number of clever techniques
		are used to demonstrate some of the smart options built into Samba.
		</para>
		</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		<term>Chapter 5 &smbmdash; Making Happy Users.</term><listitem>
		<para>
		Congratulations again. Abmas is happy with your services and you have been given another raise.
		Your users are becoming much more capable and are complaining about little
		things that need to be fixed. Are you up to the task? Mary says it takes her 20 minutes
		to log onto the network and it is killing her productivity. Email is a bit <emphasis>
		unreliable</emphasis> &smbmdash; have you been sleeping on the job? We do not discuss the
		technology of email but when the use of mail clients breaks because of networking
		problems, you had better get on top of it. It's time for a change.

		<para><emphasis>TechInfo</emphasis> &smbmdash; This &smb.conf; file
                makes use of encrypted passwords; a distributed <filename>ldapsam</filename>
                password backend is used. Roaming profiles are enabled. Desktop profile controls
		are introduced. Check out the techniques that can improve the user experience 
		of network performance. As a special bonus, this chapter documents how to configure
		smart downloading of printer drivers for drag-and-drop printing support. And, yes,
		the secret of configuring CUPS is clearly documented. Go for it; this one will

		<term>Chapter 6 &smbmdash; A Distributed 2000 User Network.</term><listitem>
		<para>
		Only eight months have passed, and Abmas has acquired another company. You now need to expand
		the network further. You have to deal with a network that spans several countries.
		There are three new networks in addition to the original three buildings at the head-office 
		campus. The head office is in New York and you have branch offices in Washington, Los Angeles, and 
		London. Your desktop standard is Windows XP Professional. In many ways, everything has changed
		and yet it must remain the same. Your team is primed for another roll-out. You know there are
		further challenges ahead.
		</para>

		<para><emphasis>TechInfo</emphasis> &smbmdash; Slave LDAP servers are introduced. Samba is
