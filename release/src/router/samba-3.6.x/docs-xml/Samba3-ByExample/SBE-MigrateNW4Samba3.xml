  <title>Migrating NetWare Server to Samba-3</title>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>Novell</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>SUSE</primary></indexterm>
	Novell is a company any seasoned IT manager has to admire. It has become increasingly
	Linux-friendly and is emerging out of a deep regression that almost saw the company
	disappear into obscurity. Novell's SUSE Linux hosts the NetWare server and it is the
	platform of choice to which many older NetWare servers are being migrated. 
	It will be interesting to see what becomes of NetWare over time.
	Meanwhile, there can be no denying that Novell is a Linux company.

	Whatever flavor of Linux is preferred in your environment, whether Red Hat, Debian,
	Gentoo, Mandrake, or SUSE (Novell), the information in this chapter should be read with
	the knowledge that file locations may vary a little; even so, the information
	in this chapter should provide something of value.

	Contributions to this chapter were made by Misty Stanley-Jones, a UNIX administrator of many
	years who surfaced on the Samba mailing list with a barrage of questions and who
	regularly helps other administrators to solve thorny Samba migration questions.

	One wonders how many NetWare servers remain in active service. Many are being migrated
	to Samba on Linux. Red Hat Linux, SUSE Linux 9.x, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 are
	ideal target platforms to which a NetWare server may be migrated. The migration method
	of choice is much dependent on the tools that the administrator finds most natural to use.
	The old-hand NetWare guru will likely want to use tools like the NetWare NLM for
	<command>rsync</command> to migrate files from the NetWare server to the Samba server.
	The UNIX administrator might prefer tools that are part of the Mars_NWE (Martin Stovers' NetWare
	Emulator) open source package. The MS Windows network administrator will likely make use of the
	NWConv utility that is a part of Windows NT4 Server. Whatever your tool of choice,
	migration will be filled with joyous and challenging moments &smbmdash; though probably not
	concurrently.
	</para>

	<para>
	The priority that Misty faced was one of migration of the data files off the NetWare 4.11
	server and onto a Samba-based Windows file and print server. This chapter does not pretend
	to document all the different methods that could be used to migrate user and group accounts
	off a NetWare server. Its focus is on migration of data files.
	</para>

	<para>
	This chapter tells its own story, so ride along. Maybe the information presented here
	will help to smooth over a similar migration challenge in your favorite networking environment.
	</para>

	<para>
	File paths have been modified to permit use of RPM packages provided by Novell. In the
	original documentation contributed by Misty, the Courier-IMAP package had been built
	directly from the original source tarball.

	<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>Novell</primary></indexterm>
	Misty Stanley-Jones was recruited by Abmas to administer a network that had
	not received much attention for some years and was much in need of a makeover.
	As a brand-new sysadmin to this company, she inherited a very old Novell file server
	and came with a determination to change things for the better.
	</para>

	<para>
	A site survey turned up the following details for the old NetWare server:
	</para>

	<simplelist>
		<member>200 MHz MMX processor</member>
		<member>512K RAM</member>

		<member>60+ users</member>
		<member>7 network-attached printers</member>
	</simplelist>

	<para>
	The company had outgrown this server several years before and was dealing with
	severe growing pains. Some of the problems experienced were:

	<indexterm><primary>payroll</primary></indexterm>
	At one point disk space had filled up to 100 percent, causing the payroll database
	to become corrupt. This caused the accounting department to be down for over
	a week and necessitated deployment of another file server. The replacement
	server was created with very poor security and design considerations from
	a discarded desktop PC.

	<para>
	Misty has provided this summary of her migration experience in the hope
	that it will help someone to avoid the challenges she faced. Perhaps her
	configuration files and background will accelerate your learning as you
	grapple with a similar migration challenge. Let there be no confusion,
	the information presented in this chapter is provided to demonstrate
	how Misty dealt with a particular NetWare migration requirement, and
	it provides an overall approach to the implementation of a Samba-3
	environment that is significantly divergent from that presented in
	<link linkend="happy"/>.
	</para>

	<para>
	The complete removal of all site-specific information in order to produce	
	a generic migration solution would rob this chapter of its character.
	It should be recognized, therefore, that the examples given require
	significant adaptation to suit local needs and thus
	there are some gaps in the example files. That is not Misty's fault;it
	is the result of treatment given to her files in an attempt to make
	the overall information more useful to you.

	After management reviewed a cost-benefit report as well as an estimated
	time-to-completion, approval was given proceed with the solution proposed.
	The server was built from purchased components. The total project cost
	was $3,000. A brief description of the configuration follows:

	A decision to use LDAP was made even though I knew nothing about LDAP except that
	I had been reading the book <quote>LDAP System Administration,</quote> by Gerald Carter.
	LDAP seemed to provide some of the functionality of Novell's e-Directory Services
	and would provide centralized authentication and identity management.

	<indexterm><primary>tree</primary></indexterm>
	Building the LDAP database took a while and a lot of trial and error. Following
	the guidance I obtained from <quote>LDAP System 
	Administration,</quote> I installed OpenLDAP (from RPM; later I compiled
	a more current version from source) and built my initial LDAP tree.

	<indexterm><primary>IMAP</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>POP3</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>SMTP</primary></indexterm>
	The first challenge was to create a company white pages, followed by manually
	entering everything from the printed company directory. This used only the inetOrgPerson
	object class from the OpenLDAP schemas. The next step was to write a shell script that
	would look at the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and <filename>/etc/shadow</filename>
	files on our mail server and create an LDIF file from which the information could be
	imported into LDAP. This would allow use of LDAP for Linux authentication, IMAP, POP3,
	and SMTP.
	</para>

	<para>
	Because a decision was made to use Courier-IMAP the schema <quote>authldap.schema</quote>
	from the Courier-IMAP source, tarball is necessary to resolve Courier-specific LDAP directory
	needs. Where the Courier-IMAP file provided by SUSE is used, this file is named
	<filename>courier.schema</filename>.
	</para>

	<para>
	Looking back, it would have been much easier to populate the LDAP directory using a convenient
	tool such as <command>phpLDAPAdmin</command> from the outset. An excessive amount of time was
	spent trying to generate LDIF files that could be parsed using the <command>ldapmodify</command>
	so that necessary changes could be written to the directory. This was a learning experience!
	</para>

	<para>
	An attempt was made to use the PADL POSIX account migration scripts, but I gave up trying to
	make them work. Instead, even though it is most inelegant, I wrote a simple script that did
	what I needed. It is enclosed as a simple example to demonstrate that you do not need to be
	a guru to make light of otherwise painful repetition. This file is listed in <link linkend="sbeamg"/>.

	The PADL MigrationTools are recommended for migration of the UNIX account information into
	the LDAP directory. The tools consist of a set of Perl scripts for migration of users, groups,
	aliases, hosts, netgroups, networks, protocols, PRCs, and services from the existing ASCII text
	files (or from a name service such as NIS). This too set can be obtained from the <ulink url=
	"http://www.padl.com">PADL Web site</ulink>.

	Note: During the process of building the new server, I kept data files
	up to date with the Novell server via use of <command>rsync</command>. 
	On a separate system (my workstation in fact), which could be rebooted
	whenever necessary, I set up a mount point to the Novell server via
	<command>ncpmount</command>. I then created a
	<filename>rsyncd.conf</filename> to share that mount point out to my
	new server, and synchronized once an hour. The script I used to synchronize
	is shown in <link linkend="sbersync"/>. The files exclusion list I used
	is shown in <link linkend="sbexcld"/>.  The reason I had to have the
	<command>rsync</command> daemon running on a system that could be
	rebooted frequently is because <constant>ncpfs</constant>
	(part of the MARS NetWare Emulation package) has a nasty habit of creating stale
	mount points that cannot be recovered without a reboot. The reason for hourly
	synchronization is because some part of the chain was very slow and
	performance-heavy (whether <command>rsync</command> itself, the network,
	or the Novell server, I am not sure, but it was probably the Novell server).

The Idealx smbldap-tools package can be configured using a script called

	<para>
	The next step was to run the <command>smbldap-populate</command> command, which populates
	the LDAP tree with the appropriate default users, groups, and UID and GID pools.
	It creates a user called Administrator with UID=0 and GID=0 matching the
	Domain Admins group. This is fine because you can still log on as root to a Windows system,
	but it will break cached credentials if you need to log on as the administrator
	to a system that is not on the network.

	<para>
	After the LDAP database has been preloaded, it is prudent to validate that the
	information needed is in the LDAP directory. This can be done done by restarting
	the LDAP server, then performing an LDAP search by executing:
<screen>
&rootprompt; ldapsearch -W -x -b "dc=abmas,dc=biz"\
	 -D "cn=Manager,dc=abmas,dc=biz" \
	"(Objectclass=*)"
Enter LDAP Password:

	With the LDAP directory now initialized, it was time to create the Windows and POSIX
	(UNIX) group accounts as well as the mappings from Windows groups to UNIX groups.
	The easiest way to do this was to use <command>smbldap-groupadd</command> command.
	It creates the group with the posixGroup and sambaGroupMapping attributes, a
	unique GID, and an automatically determined RID. I learned the hard way not to
	try to do this by hand.

	<indexterm><primary>smbldap-groupmod</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>memberUID</primary></indexterm>
	After I had my group mappings in place, I added users to the groups (the users
	don't really have to exist yet). I used the <command>smbldap-groupmod</command>
	command to accomplish this. It can also be done manually by adding memberUID
	attributes to the group entries in LDAP.
	</para>

	<indexterm><primary>sambaSamAccount</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>posixAccount</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>smbldap-usermod</primary></indexterm>
	The most monumental task of all was adding the sambaSamAccount information to each
	already existent posixAccount entry.  I did it one at a time as I moved people onto
	the new server, by issuing the command:
<screen>
&rootprompt; smbldap-usermod -a -P username
</screen>
	<indexterm><primary>NetWare</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>LDIF</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>slapcat</primary></indexterm>
	I completed that step for every user after asking the person what his or her current
	NetWare password was. The wiser way to have done it would probably have been to dump the
	entire database to an LDIF file. This can be done by executing:
<screen>
&rootprompt; slapcat &gt; somefile.ldif
</screen>
	<indexterm><primary>Perl</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>objectClass</primary></indexterm>
	Then update the LDIF file created by using a Perl script to parse and add the
	appropriate attributes and objectClasses to each entry, followed by re-importing
	the entire database into the LDAP directory. 
	</para>

	<para>
	Rebuilding of the LDAP directory can be done as follows:

	So now I could log on with a test user from the machine w2kengrspare. It was all well and
	good, but that user was in no groups yet and so had pretty boring access.  I fixed that
	by writing the login script! To write the login script, I used
	<ulink url="http://www.kixtart.org">Kixtart</ulink> because it will work
	with every architecture of Windows, has an active and helpful user base, and was both
	easier to learn and more powerful than the standard netlogon scripts I have seen.
	I also did not have to do a logon script per user or per group.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>Kixtart</primary></indexterm>
	I downloaded Kixtart and put the following files in my netlogon share:
<screen>
KIX32.EXE
KX32.dll
KX95.dll  &lt;-- Not needed unless you are running Win9x clients.
kx16.dll  &lt;-- Probably not needed unless you are running DOS clients.
kxrpc.exe &lt;-- Probably useless as it has to run on the server and can
          only be run on NT.  It's for Windows 95 to become group-aware.
          We can get around the need.
</screen>

	I then wrote the <filename>logon.kix</filename> file that is shown in

	can be split up and linked via include directives.

	<para>
	As you can see in the script, I redirected the My Documents to the user's home
	share if he or she were not in the Laptop group. I also added printers on a
	group-by-group basis, and if applicable I set the group printer. For this to
	be effective, the print drivers must be installed on the Samba server in the
	<filename>[print$]</filename> share. Ample documentation exists about how to
	do that, so it is not covered here.
	</para>

	<para>
	I call this script via the logon.bat script in the [netlogon] directory:
<screen>
\\corpsrv\netlogon\kix32 \\corpsrv\netlogon\logon.kix /f
</screen>
	I only had to fully qualify the paths for Windows 9x, as Windows NT and
	greater automatically add [NETLOGON] to the path.
	</para>

	<para>
	Also of note for Win9x is that the drive mappings and printer setup will not
	work because they rely on RPC. You merely have to put the appropriate settings
	into the <filename>c:\autoexec.bat</filename> file or map the drives manually.
	One option is to check the OS as part of the Kixtart script, and if it
	is Win9x and is the first login, copy a premade
	<filename>autoexec.bat</filename> to the <filename>C:</filename> drive. I
	have only three such machines, and one is going away in the very near future,
	so it was easier to do it by hand.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>upgrade</primary></indexterm>
	At this point I was able to add the users. This is the part that really falls
	into upgrade. I moved the users over one group at a time, starting with the
	people who used the least amount of resources on the network. With each group
	that I moved, I first logged on as a standard user in that group and took
	careful note of the environment, mainly the printers he or she used, the PATH,
	and what network resources he or she had access to (most importantly, which ones
	the user actually needed access to).
	</para>

	<para>
	I then added the user's SambaSamAccount information as mentioned earlier,
	and join the computer to the domain. The very first thing I had to do was to
	copy the user's profile to the new server. This was very important, and I really
	struggled with the most effective way to do it.  Here is the method that worked
	for every one of my users on Windows NT, 2000, and XP:
	</para>

	<procedure>
		<step><para>
			Log in as the user on the domain. This creates the local copy
			of the user's profile and copies it to the server as he or she logs out.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
			Reboot the computer and log in as the local machine administrator.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
			Right-click My Computer, click Properties, and navigate to the
			user profiles tab (varies per version of Windows).
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
			Select the user's local profile <constant>(COMPUTERNAME\username)</constant>,
			and click the <command>Copy To</command> button.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
			In the next dialog, copy it directly to the profiles share on the
			Samba server (in my case \\PDCname\profiles\user\&lt;architecture&gt;.
			You will have had to make a connection to the share as that
			user (e.g., Windows Explorer type \\PDCname\profiles\username).
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
			When the copy is complete (it can take a while) log out, and log back in
			as the user. All of his or her settings and all contents of My Documents,
			Favorites, and the registry should have been copied successfully.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
			If it doesn't look right (the dead giveaway is the desktop background),
			shut down the computer without logging out (power cycle) and try logging
			in as the user again. If it still doesn't work, repeat the steps above.
			I only had to ever repeat it once.
		</para></step>

	</procedure>

	<para>
	Words to the Wise:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>
			If the user was anything other than a standard user on his or her system
			before, you will save yourself some headaches by giving him or her identical
			permissions (on the local machine) as his or her domain account <emphasis>before</emphasis>
			copying the profile over. Do this through the User Administrator
			in the Control Panel, after joining the computer to the domain and
			before logging on as that user for the first time. Otherwise the user will
			have trouble with permissions on his or her registry keys.
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
			If any application was installed for the user only, rather than for
			the entire system, it will probably not work without being reinstalled.
		</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	After all these steps are accomplished, only cleanup details are left. Make sure user's
	shortcuts and Network Places point to the appropriate place on the new server, check
	the important applications to be sure they work as expected and troubleshoot any problems
	that might arise, and check to be sure the user's printers are present and working. By the
	way, if there are any network printers installed as system printers (the Novell way),
	you will need to log in as a local administrator and delete them.
	</para>

	<para>
	For my non-laptop systems, I would then log in and out a couple times as the user
	to be sure that his or her registry settings were modified, and then I was finished.
	</para>

	<para>
	Some compatibility issues that cropped up included the following:
	</para>

	<para>
	Blackberry client: It did not like having its registry settings moved around
	and so had to be reinstalled. Also, it needed write permissions to a portion of
	the hard drive, and I had to give it those manually on the one system where
	this was an issue.
	</para>

	<para>
	CAMedia: Digital camera software for Canon cameras caused all kinds of trouble
	with the registry. I had to use the Run as service to open the registry of
	the local user while logged in as the domain user, and give the domain user
	the appropriate permissions to some registry keys, then export that portion
	of the registry to a file. Then, as the domain user, I had to import that file
	into the registry.
	</para>

	<para>
	Crystal Reports version 7: More registry problems that were solved by recopying
	the user's profile.
	</para>

	<para>
	Printing from legacy applications: I found out that Novell sends its jobs to
	the printer in a raw format. CUPS sends them in PostScript by default. I had
	to make a second printer definition for one printer and tell CUPS specifically
	to send raw data to the printer, then assign this printer to the LPT port with
	Kixtart's version of the net use command.
	</para>

	<para>
	These were all eventually solved by elbow grease, queries to the Samba mailing
	list and others, and diligence. The complete migration took about 5 weeks.
	My userbase is relatively small but includes multiple versions of Windows,
	multiple Linux member servers, a mechanized saw, a pen plotter, and legacy
	applications written in Qbasic and R:Base, just to name a few. I actually
	ended up making some of these applications work better (or work again, as
	some of them had stopped functioning on the old server) because as part of
	the process I had to find out how things were supposed to work.
	</para>

	<para>
	The one thing I have not been able to get working is a very old database that
	we had around for reference purposes; it uses Novell's Btrieve engine.
	</para>

	<para>
	As the resources compare, I went from 95 percent disk usage to just around 10 percent.
	I went from a very high load on the server to an average load of between one
	and two runnable processes on the server. I have improved the security and
	robustness of the system. I have also implemented
	<ulink url="http://www.clamav.net">ClamAV</ulink> antivirus software,
	which scans the entire Samba server for viruses every 2 hours and
	quarantines them. I have found it much less problematic than our ancient
	version of Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition, and much more up-to-date.
	</para>

	<para>
	In short, my users are much happier now that the new server is running, and that
	is what is important to me.
	</para>
