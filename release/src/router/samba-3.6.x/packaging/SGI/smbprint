#
#      Version 1.0 13 January 1995
#		modified from the original smbprint (bsd) script
#
# this script is a System 5 printer interface script. It uses the smbclient 
# program to print the file to the specified smb-based server and service. 
# 
# To add this to your lp system, modify the server and service variables 
# and then execute the following command (as root):
#
#      lpadmin -punixprintername -v/dev/null -i/usr/samba/bin/smbprint 
# 
# where	unixprintername is the name that the printer will be known as 
# on your unix box. 
# 
# the script smbprint will be copied into your printer administration 
# directory (/usr/spool/lp) as a new interface (interface/unixprintername)
# Then you have to execute the following commands:
#
#      enable unixprintername
#      accept unixprintername
#
# This script will then be called by the lp service to print the files.
# This script will have 6 or more parameters passed to it by the lp service.
# The first five will contain details of the print job, who queued it etc,
# while parameters 6 onwards are a list of files to print.  We just
# cat these to the samba client.
#
# clear out the unwanted parameters

shift;shift;shift;shift;shift

# now the argument list is just the files to print

# Set these to the server and service you wish to print to 
# In this example I have a PC called "admin" that has a printer 
# exported called "hplj2" with no password.
#
server=admin
service=hplj2
password=""

# NOTE: The line `echo translate' provides automatic CR/LF translation 
# when printing.
(
	echo translate
	echo "print -"
	cat $*
) | /usr/samba/bin/smbclient "//$server/$service" $password -N  > /dev/null
exit $?
