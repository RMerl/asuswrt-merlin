This directory contains sample files for using Samba on an IRIX
system.  These were taken from a system running IRIX 6.2.  The
client machines were running Win95 and connected via the Ethernet
using TCP/IP and DNS.  Consult the Samba documentation for tips
on configuring Samba "properly"; this smb.conf file is very simple.
Consult the Microsoft help/documentation to understand how to
configure the networking support on the PC clients (Win95, WfW,
etc.).

This distribution is configured so that various Samba configuration,
binary, and log files are placed in the /usr/samba file hierarchy.
Man pages are placed in the /usr/share/catman/u_man hierarchy.

The version number of the distribution is a 10 digit number that
is created from the samba version number. Each section of the samba 
version number forms 2 digits of the version number (with leading 
zeros if necessary). The alpha versions add 00 and 2 digits for
the alpha number. The first release adds 0100. Patch releases add
2 digits for the patch level plus 1 and 00.

samba version 1.9.18alpha9  would become  0109180009
samba version 1.9.18        would become  0109180100
samba version 1.9.18p9      would become  0109181000

You can enable all printers on your system to be used by samba
by running the script /usr/samba/mkprintcap.sh

This distribution automatically configures samba to run as deamons
by the script /etc/init.d/samba and the file /etc/config/samba 
(used by chkconfig). If you would prefer to have samba started by 
inetd you can run the script /usr/samba/inetd.sh. 

To create a Samba distribution you must have the Documenter's WorkBench
package installed to format the manual pages. In addition you need
to have the Software Packager software (inst_dev) installed to
generate the inst images, and Perl to generate the spec and idb files.

From /usr/samba/packaging/SGI directory run the mkrelease.sh script.
There is one optional argument which is the major release number of the
OS version (4, 5, or 6) you desire.  If no number is specified it defaults
to 6.  This script uses Perl to generate the Makefile with the proper 
defines and the packaging files samba.spec and samba.idb.  The binary 
package files will be placed in ./bins
