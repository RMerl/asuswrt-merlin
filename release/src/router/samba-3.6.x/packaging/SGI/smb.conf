; Configuration file for smbd.
; ============================================================================
; For the format of this file and comprehensive descriptions of all the
; configuration option, please refer to the man page for smb.conf(5).

; This is a sample configuration for IRIX 6.x systems
;
; The following configuration should suit most systems for basic usage and 
; initial testing. It gives all clients access to their home directories and
; /usr/tmp and allows access to all printers returned by lpstat.
;
[global]
   comment = Samba %v
   workgroup = workgroup
   printing = sysv
;
; The default for printcap name is lpstat which will export all printers.
; If you want to limit the printers that are visible to clients, you can
; use a printcap file. The script mkprintcap.sh will create a printcap
; file that contains all your printers. Edit this file to only contain the
; printers that you wish to be visible. Names longer than 15 characters
; in the printcap file will not be visible to clients.
;
;   printcap name = /usr/samba/printcap
   printcap name = lpstat
;
; If you are using Impressario 1.x then you'll want to use the
; sambalp script provided with this package.  It works around
; a problem in the PostScript generated by the standard Windows
; drivers--there is a check to verify sufficient virtual memory
; is available in the printer to print the job, but this fails
; under Impressario because of a bug in Impressario 1.x.  The sambalp
; script strips out the vmstatus check.  BTW, when using this
; setup to print be sure to configure a Windows printer driver
; that generates PostScript--QMS-PS 810 is one that should work
; with the sambalp script. This version of sambalp (if installed
; as a setuid script - see the comments at the beginning of the
; script) will setuid to the username if valid on the system. This
; makes the banner pages print the proper username. You can disable
; the PostScript fixes by changing a variable in sambalp.
