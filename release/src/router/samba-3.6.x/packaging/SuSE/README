Dear SuSE user,

prebuilt Samba RPMs for all SuSE Linux versions are available at:
ftp://ftp.SuSE.com/pub/projects/samba/

The same package are also available at:
http://download.Samba.org/samba/ftp/Binary_Packages/SuSE/

Samba 3 is not supported by SuSE on SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8. You find
SerNet-supported packages on http://ftp.sernet.de/pub/samba/

If you encounter any problem with these packages please don't blame the
Samba Team.  Instead file a bug at https://bugzilla.Samba.org/ pick
product Samba 3.0, then select 'component' Packaging and set 'assign to'
to <lmuelle@suse.de>.

Have a lot of fun...
