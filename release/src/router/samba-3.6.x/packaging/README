Note:
=====
This directory is a public repository for platform specific files including
build files for binary package distributions for specific operating systems
as well as for source file distribution packages for those systems.

The Example directory should be used as a guide for preparation of binary
packages for distribution via the official samba ftp sites.

The files contained here are intended for use only by those wishing to build
distribution packages and are NOT considered suitable material for anyone who
wants to just install Samba from the pristine source files contained under
the ../source directory.

All contributions / modifications / additions / etc. to the packaging files
should be logged in https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

In the event that anyone wishes to contribute package build information please
indicate in your response how we may access a suitable system to ensure our
ability to keep the binary distribution itself current with the released source.

The future of cooperatively developed software such as Samba depends on the
willingness of all partners to share the fruit of their labours.
