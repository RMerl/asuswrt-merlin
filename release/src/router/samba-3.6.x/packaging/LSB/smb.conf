# many!) most of which are not shown in this example

# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash)

# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command "testparm"
# to check that you have not made any basic syntactic errors.

# system gethostbyname() function call that will use either /etc/hosts OR
# DNS or NIS depending on the settings of /etc/host.config, /etc/nsswitch.conf
# and the /etc/resolv.conf file. "host" therefore is system configuration
# dependant. This parameter is most often of use to prevent DNS lookups
# in order to resolve NetBIOS names to IP Addresses. Use with care!

# on the local network segment
# - OR - are not deliberately to be known via lmhosts or via WINS.
