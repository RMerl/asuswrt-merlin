INSTRUCTIONS: Preparing Samba packages for Solaris

To produce a package:

* Type sh makepkg.sh

The package will be created in the /tmp directory.

By default, the package will be built to install samba in /usr/local
To change the default, modify the INSTALL_BASE variable in makepkg.sh
This is after you have configured samba with a --prefix option of the 
alternate samba location and then created the binaries.
