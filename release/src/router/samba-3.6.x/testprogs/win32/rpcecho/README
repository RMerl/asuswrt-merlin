This directory contains two win32 programs to test large RPC requests
and responses.  The two programs are:

  server        A command line RPC server that listens and processes
                RPC requests on the \pipe\rpcecho named pipe.

  client        A command line RPC client program that 

Samba also implements the client and server sides of the rpcecho pipe
if the --enable-developer option to configure has been used.  The
rpcclient(1) program is used to implement the client side RPC
operations.

There are currently four RPC calls defined in the rpcecho pipe.  They
are: 

  AddOne	Adds one to an integer sent by the client

  EchoData	The client sends an array of bytes and it is echoed
 		back by the server.

  SourceData	The client sends an array of bytes and it is discarded
		by the server.

  SinkData	The server returns an array of bytes.

The Ethereal network protocol decoder (http://www.ethereal.com/) also
contains support for the rpcecho pipe as part of its DCERPC for
Windows.

Starting the win32 server program is easy.  Just run server.exe in a
command window.  The win32 client program is also run from a command
window.  The usage information is shown below:

  Usage: client hostname cmd [args]

  Where hostname is the name of the host to connect to,
  and cmd is the command to execute with optional args:

  	addone num	Add one to num and return the result
	echodata size	Send an array of size bytes and receive it back
	sinkdata size	Send an array of size bytes
	sourcedata size	Receive an array of size bytes
