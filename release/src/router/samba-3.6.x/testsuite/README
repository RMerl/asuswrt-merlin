README for testsuite directory
------------------------------

The Samba testsuite is divided up into the following subdirectories.

    - config          Configuration for DejaGnu program
    - lib	      Various library files used by tool directories
    
    - nsswitch        Tests for nsswitch extensions
    - server	      Miscellaneous server tests
    - rpc_client      Tests for the RPC client library code
    - rpcclient       Tests for the rpcclient program

    - build_farm      Tests designed to run automatically on the build farm

All the scripts except those in build_farm require an unreleased
version of DejaGNU, and although they contain some useful tests they
are not so useful at the moment.  All scripts are migrating to a
single test framework, Satyr.  <cvs://cvs.samba.org/data/cvs/satyr>
