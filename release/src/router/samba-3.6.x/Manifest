The Samba package you have just unpacked contains the following:

Directory	Notes:
=========	======

docs		(Samba Documentation):
----		----------------------

	All the Samba documentation for the 3.0 release have been converted to
	docbook format. Because of this the man pages are now available 
	in both traditional man page format (in the docs/manpages directory) 
	and in HTML format (in the docs/htmldocs directory).

	The Samba HOWTO Collection has undergone some rather large changes 
	and covers all parts of configuration now. It is available 
	as PDF (docs/Samba3-HOWTO.pdf) or in HTML format (in 
	the docs/htmldocs directory). Those with the docbook utilities installed 
	can generate PostScript and text versions of the HOWTO as well.

	The Samba FAQ is still a work in progress, but can be found in 
	HTML format in docs/htmldocs.


examples	(Example configuration files):
--------	------------------------------

	Please pay close attention to the reference smb.conf file
	smb.conf.default that has now been included as the master guide.

	Do read the smb.conf manual page in considering what settings are
	appropriate for your site.


packaging	(Only for those wishing to build binary distributions):
---------	-------------------------------------------------------

	Currently support is included for the following Linux Distributions :
	
		RedHat and SuSE.

	In addition, packaging support is available for SGI and Solaris systems.
	We hope that other Unix OS vendors will contribute their binary
	distribution packaging control files - and we hope to make their binary
	packages available on the master ftp site under:

		ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/Binary_Packages/"OS_Vendor"


source		(The official Samba source files - expect more of these!):
------		----------------------------------------------------------

	To build your own binary files you will need a suitable ansi C
	compiler.

	Samba uses the GNU autoconf system. In
	order to build a default Samba for your platform cd into
	the source3/ directory and then type :

		./configure

	followed by :

		make

	To install the binaries built by the above type :

		make install
 
	then set up your configuration files.

	NOTE: OS Vendors who provide Samba binary packages will generally
	integrate all Samba files into their preferred directory locations.
	These may differ from the default location ALWAYS used by the Samba
	sources. Please be careful when upgrading a vendor provided binary
	distribution from files you have built yourself.
