Because pam_smbpass is derived from the Samba smbpasswd utility, recent
versions of pam_smbpass require a copy of the Samba source code to be
available on the build system.  Version 0.7.5 has been tested against
Samba 2.2.0-alpha3, and this is the recommended version of Samba to use
for building pam_smbpass.  This only affects /building/ pam_smbpass; you
can still run any version of the Samba server that you want, although
clearly it saves some disk space to have only one copy of the source
code on your system (Samba 2.2.0-alpha3 takes roughly 32MB of disk space
to build pam_smbpass).

Version 0.7.5 features a new build system to make it easier to build
pam_smbpass.


Using the new build system
==========================

If you don't have a copy of the Samba source code on your machine, and you
don't have a preferred Samba version (or mirror site), you can build
pam_smbpass by just typing 'make'.

If you want to use a version other than 2.2.0-alpha3, or you want to
download the source code from a faster Samba mirror (see
<http://us1.samba.org/samba/> for a list of mirror sites), please download
the source code and unpack it before running make.  The build scripts will
attempt to autodetect your Samba source directory, and if it can't be
found automatically, you will be given the opportunity to specify an
alternate directory for the Samba sources.

Feedback is welcome if you try (or succeed!) to build pam_smbpass with
other versions of Samba.


Options to 'make'
=================

By default, pam_smbpass will configure the Samba build tree with the
options

    --with-fhs --with-privatedir=/etc --with-configdir=/etc

This will configure pam_smbpass to look for the smbpasswd file as
/etc/smbpasswd (or /etc/smbpasswd.tdb), and the smb.conf file as
/etc/smb.conf.  You can override these options by setting CONFIGOPTS when
calling make.  E.g., if you have your smb.conf file in /usr/etc and your
smbpasswd file in /usr/etc/private, you might run

    make CONFIGOPTS="--with-privatedir=/usr/etc/private --with-configdir=/usr/etc"

For a complete list of available configuration options, see
'./samba/configure --help'


Installing the module
=====================

If all goes well in the build process, the file pam_smbpass.so will be
created in the current directory.  Simply install the module into your
system's PAM module directory:

	install -m 755 -s bin/pam_smbpass.so /lib/security

and you're all set.
