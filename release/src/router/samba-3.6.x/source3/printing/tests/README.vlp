Virtual line printer test program (vlp)
=======================================

This can be useful for testing/debugging Samba print code.  It gives you a 
virtual full-function printer.

Setup

Set up Samba to use vlp.
	In your smb.conf file under [global], add the following option:
		printing = vlp
	and then add any number of print shares, without needing to make them 
	really exist.  

		[testprinter]
			printable = yes

	is all you need for the most basic virtual printer.
