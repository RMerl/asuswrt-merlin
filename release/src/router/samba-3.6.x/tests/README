This directory contains autoconf test programs that are too large to
comfortably fit in configure.in.

These programs should test one feature of the OS and exit(0) if it
works or exit(1) if it doesn't work (do _not_ use return)

The programs should be kept simple and to the point. Beautiful/fast
code is not necessary
