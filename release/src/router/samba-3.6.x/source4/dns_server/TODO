DNS server todo list
--------------------

Just so we don't forget the required features for an AD-compatible DNS server:

- Forwarding to other nameservers if we don't know the domain
- Additional record handling (especially in SOA records, but we'll want off of
  this stuff)
- TSIG-GSSAPI handling
- Symmetric Bind-style key handling (not strictly needed for AD, but needed for
  integration to other name servers / tools)
- Command line tools that unix admins are used to
- Zone transfer support (XFER, IFER)
- Caching
- Tests, tests, tests (probably based on python's dns implementation)
