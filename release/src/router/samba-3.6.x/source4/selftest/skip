# This file contains a list of regular expressions matching testsuites that 
# should be skipped during "make test".
#
# Possible reasons for adding a testsuite here:
# * Testsuite functionality not implemented on the server side
# * Testsuite crashes during run
# * Testsuite crashes server
# * Testsuite contains "flapping" tests (sometimes success, sometimes failure)
# * Testsuite hangs indefinitely
#
# If a testsuite is partially succeeding, please list the failing bits 
# in the selftest/knownfail file rather than disabling the testsuite completely.
# That way those tests that do succeed still get run and we will be notified
# if a known failing test suddenly starts succeeding.
#
# If a testsuite is very slow, please add it to selftest/slow instead.
# This way it will still get run in "make slowtest"
#
# Please add a comment for each testsuite you disable explaining why
# it is being skipped.
