This directory contains Samba's very simple COM implementation. 
It is by no means finished yet. 

The main aim of this implementation is for use by our DCOM implementation, 
which lives in the dcom subdirectory. The local version is used mostly for
testing.

More information on this effort can be found in the DCOM whitepaper in 
the lorikeet repository.
