This directory contains Samba specific extensions to ldb. It also
serves as example code on how to extend ldb for your own application.

The main extension Samba uses is to provide ldif encode/decode
routines for specific attributes, so users can get nice pretty
printing of attributes in ldbedit, while the attributes are stored in
the standard NDR format in the database.
