PARTITIONS UPGRADE
==================

Notes on using Samba4 after the partitions code upgrade on 21 Oct 2009

The data previously stored in Samba4 partitions is no longer
accessible, as we have changed the filenames.  

To access your Samba4 tree again, backup your Samba4 prefix, and
re-run provision with the same settings as in the past. 

This will create new databases in your PREFIX/private directory, like
DC=SAMBA,DC=EXAMPLE,DC=COM.ldb.  

Restore your users.ldb to the DC=SAMBA,DC=EXAMPLE,DC=COM.ldb,
configuration.ldb to CN=CONFIGURATION,DC=SAMBA,DC=EXAMPLE,DC=COM.ldb
and schema.ldb to
CN=SCHEMA,CN=CONFIGURATION,DC=SAMBA,DC=EXAMPLE,DC=COM.ldb

Also remember to restore your secrets.ldb.
