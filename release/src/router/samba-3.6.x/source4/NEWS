This file aims to document the major changes since the latest released version 
of Samba, 3.0. Samba 4.0 contains rewrites of several subsystems 
and uses a different internal format for most data. Since this 
file is an initial draft, please update missing items.

One of the main goals of Samba 4 was Active Directory Domain Controller 
support. This means Samba now implements several protocols that are required 
by AD such as Kerberos and DNS.

An (experimental) upgrade script that performs a one-way upgrade 
from Samba 3 is available in source/setup/upgrade.

Removal of nmbd and introduction of process models
==================================================
smbd now implements several network protocols other than just CIFS and 
DCE/RPC. nmbd's functionality has been merged into smbd. smbd supports 
various 'process models' that specify how concurrent connections are 
handled (when to fork, use threads, etc). 

Introduction of LDB
===================
Samba now stores most of its persistent data in a LDAP-like database 
called LDB (see ldb(7) for more info). 

Removed SWAT
==================
Unlike previous versions, Samba4 does not provide a web interface at this time.

Built-in KDC
============
Samba4 ships with an integrated KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution
Center).  Backed directly onto our main internal database, and
integrated with custom code to handle the PAC, Samba4's KDC is an
integral part of our support for AD logon protocols.

Built-in LDAP Server
====================
Like the situation with the KDC, Samba4 ships with it's own LDAP
server, included to provide simple, built-in LDAP services in an AD
(rather than distinctly standards) matching manner.  The database is
LDB, and it shares that in common with the rest of Samba.

Changed configuration options
=============================
Several configuration options have been removed in Samba4 while others have 
been introduced. This section contains a summary of changes to smb.conf and 
where these settings moved. Configuration options that have disappeared may be 
re-added later when the functionality that uses them gets reimplemented in 
Samba 4.

The 'security' parameter has been split up. It is now only used to choose 
between the 'user' and 'share' security levels (the latter is not supported 
in Samba 4 yet). The other values of this option and the 'domain master' and 
'domain logons' parameters have been merged into a 'server role' parameter 
that can be either 'domain controller', 'member server' or 'standalone'. Note that 
member server support does not work yet.

The following parameters have been added:
+ rpc big endian (G)
	Make Samba fake it is running on a bigendian machine when using DCE/RPC. 
	Useful for debugging.

	Default: no

+ case insensitive filesystem (S)
	Set to true if this share is located on a case-insensitive filesystem.
	This disables looking for a filename by trying all possible combinations of 
	uppercase/lowercase characters and thus speeds up operations when a 
	file cannot be found. 

	Default: no
	
+ setup directory
	Path to data used by provisioning script.

	Default: Set at compile-time
	
+ ncalrpc dir
	Directory to use for UNIX sockets used by the 'ncalrpc' DCE/RPC transport.

	Default: Set at compile-time
	
+ ntvfs handler
	Backend to the NT VFS to use (more than one can be specified). Available
	backends include: 
	
	- posix:
		Maps POSIX FS semantics to NT semantics

	- simple:
		Very simple backend (original testing backend).

	- unixuid:
		Sets up user credentials based on POSIX gid/uid.

	- cifs:
		Proxies a remote CIFS FS. Mainly useful for testing.

	- nbench:
		Filter module that saves data useful to the nbench benchmark suite.

	- ipc:
		Allows using SMB for inter process communication. Only used for 
		the IPC$ share.

	- print:
		Allows printing over SMB. This is LANMAN-style printing (?), not 
		the be confused with the spoolss DCE/RPC interface used by later 
		versions of Windows.
	
	Default: unixuid default

+ ntptr providor
	FIXME

+ dcerpc endpoint servers
	What DCE/RPC servers to start.

	Default: epmapper srvsvc wkssvc rpcecho samr netlogon lsarpc spoolss drsuapi winreg dssetup

+ server services
	Services Samba should provide.

	Default: smb rpc nbt wrepl ldap cldap web kdc

+ sam database
	Location of the SAM (account database) database. This should be a

	Default: set at compile-time

+ spoolss database
	Spoolss (printer) DCE/RPC server database. This should be a LDB URL.

	Default: set at compile-time

	Default: set at compile-time
	
+ client use spnego principal
	Tells the client to use the Kerberos service principal specified by the 
	server during the security protocol negotation rather than 
	looking up the principal itself (cifs/hostname).

	Default: false

+ nbt port
	TCP/IP Port used by the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) implementation.
 
	Default: 137

	IP port used by the kerberos password change protocol.

	Default: 464
	
+ web port
	TCP/IP port SWAT should listen on.

	Default: 901

+ tls enabled
	Enable TLS support for SWAT
	
	Default: true
	
+ tls keyfile
	Path to TLS key file (PEM format) to be used by SWAT. If no 
	path is specified, Samba will create a key.

	Default: none

	path is specified, Samba will create a certificate.

	Default: none
