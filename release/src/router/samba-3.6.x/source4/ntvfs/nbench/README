This module provides a way to capture file sharing loads for the
NBENCH benchmark client. It also servers as an example of a NTVFS
filter module.

Here is an example config that passes through to the CIFS NTVFS backend.

[bench]
	ntvfs handler = nbench cifs
	cifs:server = myserver
	cifs:user = myuser
	cifs:password = mypass
	cifs:domain = MYDOMAIN
	cifs:share = bench
