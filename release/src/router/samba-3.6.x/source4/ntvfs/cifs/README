This is the 'CIFS on CIFS' backend for Samba. It provides a NTVFS
backend that talks to a remote CIFS server. The primary aim of this
backend is for debugging and development, although some poeple may
find it useful as a CIFS gateway.

There are two modes of operation: Password specified and delegated
credentials.

Password specified:
-------------------

This uses a static username/password in the config file, example:

[myshare]
	ntvfs handler = cifs
	cifs:server = myserver
	cifs:user = tridge
	cifs:password = mypass
	cifs:domain = TESTDOM
	cifs:share = test


Delegated credentials:
----------------------

If your incoming user is authenticated with Kerberos, and the machine
account for this Samba4 proxy server is 'trusted for delegation', then
the Samba4 proxy can forward the client's credentials to the target.

You must be joined to the domain (net join <domain> member).

To set 'trusted for delegation' with MMC, see the checkbox in the
Computer account property page under Users and Computers.

[myshare]
	ntvfs handler = cifs
	cifs:server = myserver
	cifs:share = test
