README for Samba Password Database (PDB) examples

The test.c file in this directory contains a very basic example of 
a pdb plugin. It just prints the name of the function that is executed using
DEBUG. Maybe it's nice to include some of the arguments to the function in the 
future too..

To debug passdb backends, try to run gdb on the 'pdbedit' executable. That's
really much easier than restarting smbd constantly and attaching with your 
debugger.

New passdb plugins should go into the samba lib directory, (/usr/lib/samba/pdb/
for most distributions). An example would be: /usr/lib/samba/pdb/test.so

Be aware that the SQL and XML based passdb modules have been removed since the
3.0.23 release.  More information of external support for SQL passdb modules
can be found at http://pdbsql.sourceforge.net/.
