This is an example script for doing dynamic DNS updates from the WINS
database. You use this by putting the full path to the script in the
"wins hook" option in smb.conf. Remember to mark the script executable
and to set the right domain at the top of the script.

See the BIND documentation for how to enable dynamic DNS
updates. Remember to restrict the updates as far as you can to reduce
the security risks inherent in dynamic DNS.
