Subject: This directory will contain debugging tools and tips.

Notes: Identification and confirmation of some bugs can be difficult.
       When such bugs are encountered it is necessary to provide as
       sufficient detailed debugging information to assist the developer
       both by providing incontrivertable proof of the problem, but also
       precise information regarding the values of variables being processed
       at the time the problem strikes.

       This directory is the ideal place to locate useful hints, tips and
       methods that will help Samba users to provide the information that
       developers need.

============================ Solaris Method A ==============================
File:	 		solaris-oops.sh
Contributor: 	David Collier-Brown
Date: 			June 27, 2005
Method and Use:
To the global stanza of smb.conf add:
	panic action = /usr/local/bin/solaris-oops.sh %d

When the panic action is initiated a voluntary core dump file will be placed 
in /var/tmp. Use this method with "log level = 10" and an smbd binary that
has been built with the '-g' option.
