NOTE! These patches are now incorporated in bind9 releases from
9.7.2RC1 and onwards. You no longer need a patched version of bind9 to
work with krb5 DNS updates and Samba4.

---------------------------------

These patches fix the TSIG-GSS dynamic DNS updates in bind9 to allow
dynamic updates to work with recent windows versions.

The patches were developed against bind9 version 9.6.1, and were
tested on Ubuntu Karmic.
