Some simple example programs for libsmbclient ...

testsmbc.c is kinda broken as it has many hardcoded bits in it

testbrowse.c opens a remote folder and displays its contents

teststat.c allows comparing the results of smbc_stat() against a local stat() of
the same file.

tree.c is an example of how you might do some of these things with GTK+
It needs lots of work but shows you some ways to use libsmbclient.

smbwrapper implements the old smbsh/smbwrapper mechanism using libsmbclient, in
such a way that it works on Linux
