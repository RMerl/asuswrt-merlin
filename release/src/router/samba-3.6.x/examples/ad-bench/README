Active Directory benchmark
==========================

Setup
=====

You need to modify settings.sh to point to the correct binaries for your
platform. One thing you might want to do in order to be able to run the
benchmark as a non-root user is to compile your own samba version with the
--prefix configure option set to some location writeable by the user who will be
running the benchmark. You then need to point the NET variable to the correct
location.

Most likely, you will also want to put the realm to kdc hostname mappings into
krb5.conf and the hostname to IP address mappings for the kdcs to test into the
hosts file, so you actually benchmark the AD speed, not DNS lookup speed.

Running the benchmarks
======================

Per default, the benchmark looks for a file called runs.txt in the directory the
benchmark is run from. (This is configurable in the settings.sh file)
runs.txt contains the credentials and server names to connect to, one set of
credentials/server per line. The format is as follows:

user@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM%password:domain_controller_host_name
