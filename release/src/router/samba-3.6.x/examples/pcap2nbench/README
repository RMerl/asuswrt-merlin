pcap2nbench
-----------

About

This program converts a libpcap network trace file (produced by ethereal or
another pcap-aware network analyzer) into a output suitable for nbench.  The
only option it takes it -i which supresses any reads/writes/closes that use a
FID that does not have a corresponding ntcreateandx

Limitations

1) pcap2nbench does not handle ip fragmentation.  You should not normally see
   very much fragmentation so this should not really affect a workload.
2) unicode on the wire is not supported.
3) only a limited number of SMBs are supported.  Namely: NtCreateAndX,
   ReadAndX, WriteAndX, and Close.  In addition, not all WCTs are supported on
   each of these SMBs.

Future Work

It would be nice to use Samba or Ethereal's parsing code to handle the SMBs.
At first glance, this seemed non-trivial.  It would also be nice to handle some
Trans2 SMBs specifically QueryFileInfo and QueryPathInfo.
