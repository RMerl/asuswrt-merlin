README for Samba Virtual File System (VFS) Example
===================================================

This directory contains skeleton VFS modules.  When used,
this module simply passes all requests back to the disk functions
(i.e it operates as a passthrough filter).  It should be
useful as a starting point for developing new VFS
modules. 

Please look at skel_opaque.c when you want your module to provide
final functions, like a database filesystem.

Please look at skel_transport.c when you want your module to provide
passthrough functions, like audit modules. 

Please read the VFS chapter in the HOWTO collection for general help 
on the usage of VFS modules.

Further documentation on writing VFS modules for Samba can be found in
Samba Developers Guide.
