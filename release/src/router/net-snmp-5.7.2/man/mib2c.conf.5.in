.SH DESCRIPTION
The mib2c.conf script language is a MIB-particular language designed
to easily process MIB nodes in ways that you want.  mib2c is a
misnomer (for historical purposes), because you can produce anything
(not just C code).  Look in the Net-SNMP "local" directory for a bunch
of example mib2c.*.conf files and behold the power before you.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
All commands within mib2c.conf files are embraced by @ signs.
Anything with an @ sign at the front and back of the line is generally
supposed to be a mib2c specific command.  These are detailed here:

.SH VARIABLES
.PP
Variables in the mib2c language look very similar to perl variables,
in that they start with a "$".  They can be used for anything you
want, but most typically they'll hold mib node names being processed
by @foreach ...@ clauses.
.PP
They also have a special properties when they are a mib node, such that
adding special suffixes to them will allow them to be interpreted in
some fashion.  The easiest way to understand this is through an
example.  If the variable 'x' contained the word 'ifType' then some
magical things happen.  In mib2c output, anytime $x is seen it is
replaced with "ifType".  Additional suffixes can be used to get other
aspects of that mib node though.  If $x.objectID is seen, it'll be
replaced by the OID for ifType: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3".  Other
suffixes that can appear after a dot are listed below.
.PP
One last thing: you can use things like $vartext immediately ending in
some other text, you can use {}s to get proper expansion of only part
of the mib2c input.  IE, $xtext will produce "$xtext", but ${x}text
will produce "ifTypetext" instead.
