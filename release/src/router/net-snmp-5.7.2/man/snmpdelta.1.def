.SH NAME
snmpdelta \- Monitor delta differences in SNMP Counter values
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpdelta
[ COMMON OPTIONS ] [\-Cf] [ \-Ct ] [ \-Cs ] [ \-CS ] [ \-Cm ] [ \-CF configfile ] [ \-Cl ] [ \-Cp period ] [ \-CP Peaks ] [ \-Ck ] [ \-CT ] AGENT OID [ OID ... ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B snmpdelta
will monitor the specified integer valued OIDs, and report changes
over time.
.PP
AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented
to monitor the given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT
specification will consist of a hostname or an IPv4
address.  In this situation, the command will attempt
communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161
of the given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of
the possible formats for AGENT.
.PP
OID is an object identifier which uniquely
identifies the object type within a MIB. Multiple
OIDs can be specified on a single snmpdelta command.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B COMMON OPTIONS
Please see
.I snmpcmd(1)
for a list of possible values for COMMON OPTIONS
as well as their descriptions.
.TP
.B \-Cf
Don't fix errors and retry the request.
Without this option, if multiple oids have been specified for
a single request and if the request for one or more of the
oids fails, snmpdelta will retry the request so that data for
oids apart from the ones that failed will still be returned. 
Specifying \-Cf tells
.I  snmpdelta
not to retry a request, even
if there are multiple oids specified.
.TP
.B \-Ct
Flag will determine time interval from the monitored entity.
.TP
.B \-Cs
Flag will display a timestamp.
.TP
.B \-CS
Generates a "sum count" in addition to the individual instance
counts.  The "sum count" is the total of all the individual
deltas for each time period.
.TP
.B \-Cm
Prints the max value ever attained.
.TP
.B \-CF configfile
Tells
.B snmpdelta
to read it's configuration from the specified file.
This options allows the input to be set up in advance rather
than having to be specified on the command line.
.TP
.B \-Cl
Tells
.B snmpdelta
to write it's configuration to files whose names correspond to the MIB
instances monitored.  For example, snmpdelta \-Cl localhost ifInOctets.1
will create a file "localhost\-ifInOctets.1".
.TP
.B \-Cp
Specifies the number of seconds between polling periods.
Polling constitutes sending a request to the agent. The
default polling period is one second.
.TP
.B \-CP peaks
Specifies the reporting period in number of polling periods.
If this option is specified, snmpdelta polls the agent
.I peaks
number of times before reporting the results.
The result reported includes the average value over
the reporting period. In addition, the highest polled
value within the reporting period is shown.
.TP
.B \-Ck
When the polling period (\-Cp) is an increment of 60 seconds
and the timestamp is displayed in the output (\-Cs), then
the default display shows the timestamp in the format
hh:mm mm/dd. This option causes the timestamp format
to be hh:mm:ss mm/dd.
.TP
.B \-CT
Makes 
.B snmpdelta
print its output in tabular form.
.TP
.B \-Cv vars/pkt
Specifies the maximum number of oids allowed to be packaged
in a single PDU. Multiple PDUs can be created in a single
request. The default value of variables per packet is 60.
This option is useful if a request response results in an
error becaues the packet is too big.
.PP
Note that
.B snmpdelta
REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to query
and at least one OID argument, as described in the 
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page.
