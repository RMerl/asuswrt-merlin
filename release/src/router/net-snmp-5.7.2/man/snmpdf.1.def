.SH NAME
snmpdf - display disk space usage on a network entity via SNMP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpdf
[COMMON OPTIONS] [\-Cu] AGENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpdf
is simply a networked version of the typical df command.  It
checks the disk space on the remote machine by examining the
HOST\-RESOURCES\-MIB's hrStorageTable or the UCD\-SNMP\-MIB's dskTable.
By default, the hrStorageTable is preferred as it typically contains
more information.  However, the \-Cu argument can be passed to snmpdf
to force the usage of the dskTable.
.PP
AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented
to monitor the gievn objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT
specification will consist of a hostname or an IPv4
address.  In this situation, the command will attempt
communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161
of the given target host. See the
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page for a full list of the possible formats for AGENT.
.PP
See the
.I snmpd.conf(5)
manual page on setting up the dskTable using the 
.I disk
directive in the snmpd.conf file.

.B COMMON OPTIONS
Please see
.I snmpcmd(1)
for a list of possible values for COMMON OPTIONS
as well as their descriptions.
.TP
.B \-Cu
Forces the command to use dskTable in mib
UCD\-SNMP\-MIB instead of the default to determine
the storage information. Generally, the default
use of hrStorageTable in mib HOST\-RESOURCES\-MIB
is preferred because it typically contains
more information.
