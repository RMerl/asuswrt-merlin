This file contains a list of specific bugs that have been fixed, and patches
that have been applied in released versions.  Please see the NEWS file for
a summary of the major changes, and the ChangeLog file for a comprehensive
listing of all changes made to the code.

*5.7.2*

    snmplib:
      - Add Doxygen-style function header for
	netsnmp_register_default_target() and
	netsnmp_clear_default_target().
      - Add netsnmp_setenv().
      - Avoid that system clock changes (e.g. by ntpd) affect code that
	needs relative time Make sure that the range of the SNMPv3 variable
	snmpEngineTime is 0..2147483647 on all supported systems instead of
	0..42949672 on some systems (i.e. wraparound after 497 days) Add
	netsnmp_get_monotonic_clock(), netsnmp_set_monotonic_marker(),
	netsnmp_ready_monotonic(), netsnmp_get_agent_runtime()
      - Avoid that system clock changes (e.g. by ntpd) affect code that
	needs relative time Make sure that the range of the SNMPv3 variable
	snmpEngineTime is 0..2147483647 on all supported systems instead of
	0..42949672 on some systems (i.e. wraparound after 497 days) Add
	netsnmp_get_monotonic_clock(), netsnmp_set_monotonic_marker(),
	netsnmp_ready_monotonic(), netsnmp_get_agent_runtime() Deprecate
	atime_diff(), atime_newMarker(), atime_ready(), atime_setMarker(),
	marker_tticks(), netsnmp_marker_uptime(), netsnmp_timeval_uptime(),
	timeval_tticks(), uatime_diff(), uatime_hdiff() and uatime_ready().
      - Avoid waiting indefinitely if a session has timeout zero
      - Declare "type" argument of se_store_list() / se_store_slist() /
	se_store_enum_list() const
      - Make it explicit that MAX_SUBID is an unsigned constant
      - Make netsnmp_callback_accept() return -1 (failure) instead of 0
	(STDIN_FILENO)
      - Make netsnmp_large_fd_set_resize() robust against memory allocation
	failures. Make NETSNMP_LARGE_FD_ZERO() use memset() on Unix systems
	instead of an explicit loop.
      - Make netsnmp_large_fd_set_resize() robust against memory allocation
	failures. Make NETSNMP_LARGE_FD_ZERO() use memset() on Unix systems
	instead of an explicit loop. Make sure that on Unix systems
	netsnmp_large_fd_clr() doesn't try to read memory it isn't allowed
	to read if the first argument equals -1 (a value that shouldn't be
	passed by the caller).
      - Merge together the Linux and *BSD version of src port sending.
      - Only transform the address to printable form when needed.
      - PATCH 3510454: Allow the use of 0.0.0.0/0 as alias for default
      - Prevent gcc ped-warning for NETSNMP_REMOVE_CONST git-svn-id:
	file:///home/hardaker/lib/sf-bkups/net-snmp-convert-svnrepo/trunk@1
	8052 06827809-a52a-0410-b366-d66718629ded
      - Reduce overhead of config file parsing
      - Remove obsolete snmp_get_fd_for_session() declaration
      - Separate out the cmesg buffer size
      - Set the rpath for libperl.so in libnetsnmpmibs.so such that the
	dynamic linker can find libperl.so without requiring the user to
	modify the dynamic linker settings. This change in
	agent/Makefile.in is necessary on the 5.5 branch and later but not
	on the 5.4 branch. That is because the 5.4 branch uses an older
	version of libtool that propagates the rpath of dependent
	libraries. This is called inter-library dependency tracking in the
	libtool manual. This functionality is present in libtool version 1
	but not in libtool version 2. For more background information about
	dynamic libraries and rpaths, see also the document with the title
	"RpathIssue" on the Debian wiki
	(http://wiki.debian.org/RpathIssue).
      - Simplify implementation of functions manipulating 64-bit numbers.
      - Simplify the se_store_enum_list() implementation
      - Use SNMP_ALLOC_TYPEDEF to allocate transports in order to avoid the
	separate call to memset.
      - [PATCH 3414773]: Encode integer value using ASN_INTEGER
      - [PATCH 3526599]: Don't hang on retried failing SNMPv3 responses
      - PATCH 3560473: from fenner: Handle TimeTicks when pretty-printing
	OID   Signed-off-by: Wes Hardaker <hardaker@users.sourceforge.net>
      - Add the symbol NETSNMP_PRIo to help in printing oid values.
      - Do not crash from empty values in --token=value arguments
      - Do not crash on incomplete configuration tokens.
      - Do not truncate single default transport domains
      - Move the check that the pdu variable is non-NULL to before the
	first dereference of it.

    snmplib + snmpd + snmpwalk:
      - Avoid that system clock changes (e.g. by ntpd) affect code that
	needs relative time

    snmplib, snmpd, perl:
      - Eliminate dead variables agent/mibgroup/agentx/master_admin.c
	agent/mibgroup/etherlike-mib/data_access/dot3stats_linux.c
	agent/mibgroup/etherlike-mib/dot3StatsTable/dot3StatsTable_data_acc

      - BUG: 3517030: Ensure large tables are walked properly
      - BUG: 3541012: Fix handling of gettable columns
      - [PATCH 3529541]: Don't refer to internal 'my' variables from
	external scripts Fix provided by Lezz Giles

    snmp:
      - Bridge-mib: Fix index interpretation. This patch corrects a wrong
	data interpretation. snmp-bridge-mib obtains the ifindex value from
	the sysfs attribute 'ifindex' The value given by the sysfs
	attribute is an integer, which is handled as hex and leads to
	incorrect data displayed to the user. e.g. $ > snmpwalk localhost
	BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dBasePortIfIndex.2
	BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dBasePortIfIndex.2 = INTEGER: 54 according to the
	sysfs attribute the value is 36 $ > cat
	/sys/class/net/<device>/ifindex 36 Signed-off-by: Mijo Safradin
	<safradin@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

    snmpd:
      - Lowered severity of 'Error expanding XXX to 64bits' messages.
      - Removed error log messages when IPv6 is disabled.
      - Add missing debug tag
      - Add netsnmp_get_next_alarm_time()
      - Avoid that system clock changes (e.g. by ntpd) affect code that
	needs relative time Make sure that the range of the SNMPv3 variable
	snmpEngineTime is 0..2147483647 on all supported systems instead of
	0..42949672 on some systems (i.e. wraparound after 497 days)
      - BUG 3542188: Correct sysORDescr for snmpUsmMIB. Thanks to Dave
	Vucich for reporting this.
      - BUG 3542307: Correct sysORID for snmpMPDStats. Thanks to Dave

	ucd-snmp/pass_persist
      - BUG: 3439234: Move netsnmp_pass_str_to_errno to pass_common and
	rename it to netsnmp_internal_pass_str_to_errno
      - BUG: 3463767: Handle parsing subidentifiers > 2^31
      - BUG: 3532090: Fix high ifIndex values crashing hrDeviceDescr
      - Call snmp_oidtree_compare instead of snmp_oid_min_compare
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Avoid dangling pointers (based on patch 3503259)
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Avoid reading freed memory when deleting a row
	from a table
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Do not send the contents of the stack over the
	network
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Don't call exit() upon memory allocation failure
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Fix IPv6 socket leak in error paths
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Fix a socket leak triggered by pinging a remote
	host
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Fix more memory leaks
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Fix several memory leaks
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Make ping implementation independent of ntpd clock
	jumps
      - DISMAN-PING-MIB: Make pinging local interface addresses work
      - DISMAN-SCHEDULER-MIB: Handle 32-character schedContextName values
	correctly. See also commit
	b3c4982542e0ab151fb3884754cdfbcb472da52d.
      - Disable the support for integer64 in pass scripts if compiling
	without opaque-special-types.
      - Factor out asc2bin and bin2asc. Add a netsnmp_internal_ prefix to
	them
      - Fixed UCD-SNMP-MIB::systemStats after 30 days of uptime. After 30
	days, values from /proc/stat (on Linux) can get bigger than 32bits
	and snmpd calculations might render counters like ssCpuUser
	negative or zero, while the real value is higher. Therefore the
	counters should be tracked as the largest integer available.
      - Fixed snmpd '-d' option. Now it dumps packets again.
      - IF-MIB::ifType: Report type "infiniband (199)" for InfiniBand
	interfaces instead of type "other (1)".
      - Init_agent() + init_kmem(): Return an error value instead of
	invoking exit() if access to kernel virtual memory is denied
      - Make the configuration of the dlmod module fail rather than
	generate a dummy module if the dlopen function isn't available.
      - Match each getpwnam()/getpwuid() call with an endpwent() call and
	each getgrent() call with an endgrent() call.
      - PATCH 3402376: from Leonardo Chiquitto: Recognise ReiserFS Also
	move various FSType definitions to the appropriate blocks
      - PATCH 3453868: from "Bill Fenner <fenner@gmail.com>": Factor common
	code into pass_common Move the code for pormatting and printing
	values from pass and pass_persist into pass_common.
      - PATCH: 3487867: Don't skip missing ifXTable entries
	(ifConnectorPresent FALSE)
      - Pass_persist:  Fixes a race condition introduced in commit
	31fa07cd9ffde46d41d2b5838c3fc4d01548bfb5. The following race
	condition could happen: - A system call fails and errno is set
	accordingly by the C library. - SIGCHLD handler invokes a system
	call that fails and hence overwrites errno. - SIGCHLD handler
	leaves. - original context checks errno and finds the value from
	the system call invoked by the SIGCHLD handler instead of the
	system call that failed originally. Other fixes included in this
	patch: - Renamed deinit_pass_persist() into shutdown_pass_persist()
	such that this function gets called during agent shutdown. - Made
	sure that shutdown_pass_persist() is called by the Windows
	snmpd.exe too. - Windows: avoid calling
	CloseHandle(INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE). - Windows: avoid that closing a
	pass_persist pipe triggers a crash. - Windows: pass_persist: close
	handles of finished processes.
	agent/mibgroup/ucd-snmp/pass_persist.c win32/mib_module_shutdown.h
      - Smux: simplify smux_list_detach()
      - UDP-MIB: Report the proper address in udpLocalAddress instead of
	0.0.0.0. Makes test T160snmpnetstat pass again. Fixes a bug
	introduced in commit c76fb96f65e33ba2fd212a921e8c386155ee5c7a.

	Ritter

    snmpdx:
      - [PATCH 3445437]: Log AgentX disconnections (in line with
	connections) Patch provided by Bill Fenner

    snmptrapd:
      - Avoid crash during shutdown due to invoking perl_destruct(NULL)
      - Do not invoke shutdown_perl() from inside the SIGTERM handler since
	that fails if SIGTERM is received while a Perl handler is active.
	Based on a patch posted by Joel Avni <javni@arubanetworks.com>
      - Eliminate an unused variable (Now)
      - Move the main loop code into a new function
      - Remove superfluous casts

    snmptrapd_sql:
      - Avoid that a linker error is triggered on systems where my_progname
	is missing in libmysqlclient (e.g. Fedora 15 and 16). This is a
	backport of commit 9f653f7.

    aix:

	up
      - PATCH 3403433: from blentz: Issues with hrSWRunName and Parameters
	on AIX	 Signed-off-by: Wes Hardaker
	<hardaker@users.sourceforge.net>

    apps, snmplib:
      - PATCH: 2835577: identified by "Bart Van Assche": Replace SNMP_ZERO
	of arrays with a memset. git-svn-id:
	file:///home/hardaker/lib/sf-bkups/net-snmp-convert-svnrepo/trunk@1
	7797 06827809-a52a-0410-b366-d66718629ded
      - BUG: 3529768: Be more careful when stripping off numeric suffixes

    build:
      - Do not generate an output file on failure make supposes that no
	output is generated if the command failed. Change feature-remove to
	follow that presumption.
      - BUG: 3532234: Fix typo in libtool script (addressed properly in
	libtool 2.4.2)

    building:
      - Add dependencies on @FEATURETARGS@ to make the subtarget work as
	well.
      - Add missing end comments to feature ifndefs.
      - Add target to build agentxtrap from the toplevel
      - Build fix for systems lacking field msg_flags in struct msghdr
	(e.g. IRIX)
      - Build fix for systems lacking fields msg_control/msg_flags in
	struct msghdr (backport)
      - Correct dependencies - since
	bf74fea69f24dc6e85f908f3f41d1426b2e09688 snmpconf is located in
	builddir, not srcdir
      - Correct dependencies - since
	bf74fea69f24dc6e85f908f3f41d1426b2e09688 snmpconf is located in
	builddir, not srcdir" This reverts commit
	9efa467a972bb6e1c7fbdaf2e27429d29f4ab89e.
      - Make the transport configuration code work again Previously the
	transport inheritance processing code ran with
	NETSNMP_FEATURE_CHECKING set. In this mode the file
	net-snmp/feature-details.h is requiered. That file is created
	during the first make run, and that happens after configure is run.
	Change this to undefine NETSNMP_MINIMAL_CODE, effectively turning
	off feature support during transport configuration in order to make
	it work at all.
      - Run libtool --mode=finish on the right directory

    libnetsnmp:
      - PATCH 3394586: from rwa-co: file descriptor leak in read_config
	(+fix) Signed-off-by: Wes Hardaker <hardaker@users.sourceforge.net>

    libsnmp:
      - Changed the type of the fourth argument of netsnmp_set_row_column()
	from const char* to const void* such that no cast is necessary when
	passing another datatype then char* or const char*.

    man:
      - [BUG 3490708]: Clarify use of common command-line options
      - BUG: 3535269: Document use of [snmp] for client-side tools.

    pass:

    perl:
      - Add agent::uptime()
      - Enable sending SNMPv2 traps with an empty varbind list
      - Fix spelling in the documentation of the SNMP module
      - Fixed segmentation fault when handler registration fails. When
	netsnmp_register_handler fails, it frees its reginfo ->
	nsahr_DESTROY (and any other function) must not dereference it.
      - Perl: Make sure that the constant SNMP_DEFAULT_RETRIES is
	recognized. SNMP module: Add constants
	NETSNMP_CALLBACK_OP_RECEIVED_MESSAGE and
	NETSNMP_CALLBACK_OP_TIMED_OUT. When the Net-SNMP Perl modules are
	built on Windows with MSVC or MinGW it is possible that each these
	are linked with another version of the MSVC runtime library than
	the Perl interpreter itself. In that case the "errno" variable used
	inside .xs source files is another variable than the $! variable in
	.pm files. Or: assignments to "errno" in a .xs file do not modify
	the "$!" Perl variable This patch avoids using "errno" by modifying
	the different constant() functions such that these return a
	two-element array instead of returning a scalar and setting errno.

    python:
      - Avoid that an SNMP set with UseEnums enabled causes a segmentation
	fault
      - [PATCH 3433846]: Fix for use with python 2.4
      - BUG: 3535967: Fix memory leak - snmp_{sess_}error allocates the
	output buffer

    testing:
      - Add a test for se_store_list()
      - Add testing/fulltests/default/T154dismanpingmib_simple
      - Avoid false negative for T114agentxagentxtrap_simple caused by the
	test result being present in the hex dump ("mostly_harmless")
      - Convert snmplib/test_binary_array.c into two unit tests
      - Fix Perl regression test failures All Perl regression tests pass
	now on Linux and on Windows (MSVC).
      - Make the asn1 test pass even if support for opaque types are
	removed.
      - Perl regression tests: Don't fail skipped tests.
      - Protect the use of $OSTYPE to ensure that 'test' get enough
	parameters.
      - Remove an incorrect comment from simple_eval_tools.sh
      - Remove unused variable
      - Require a semicolon after OK(), OKF() and PLAN() Also, let OKF()
	emit a single line of output such that all output it produces is
	visible in the output of "make test".
      - [BUG 3474590]: Don't match underscores within the source root
	filename
      - Add test cases for snmp_service

    unspecified:
      - Added CVFS (CentraVision File System) to hrStorageTable and
	hrFSTable.
      - Removed counter-64 error messages.   These messages do not say
	enything useful, caller should check their return value and report
	it.
      - Added OCFS2 (Oracle Cluster FS) to hrStorageTable and hrFSTable
      - [BUG 3444939]: BUG: 1796886: snmplib: Avoid that
	sprint_realloc_octet_string() embeds unprintable control characters
	or binary zeroes in its output. This behavior could cause truncated
	output in snmptrapd.
      - [BUG 3452069]: Fix snmptrap_oid declaration in mib2c generated code
	This bug was introduced considerable time ago. It did already exist
	at the time the 5.6 branch was created (see also commit
	0ec088afa27cfda4e6ea78aae7cfc5507564edde).
      - [BUG 3454168]: configure: Fix building with --enable-read-only
      - [PATCH 3418649]: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB: Use pclose() instead of
	fclose() to close a pipe.
      - [BUG 3540621]: dist: Add missing Provides: to net-snmp-perlmods RPM
	spec

    BSD:

    Bug 3152841:
      - Do not install the util_funcs subheaders that were removed in 5.7
      - Install util_funcs subheaders
      - Install util_funcs subheaders introduced in 5.6

    Cygwin:
      - Make date_n_time() produce time zone information

    Cywin:
      - Agent: Implement get_uptime() such that querying
	HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemUptime returns a non-zero value.

    FreeBSD:
      - Restore IP_RECVDSTADDR functionality.
      - Snmpd + apps: Sending UDP packets works again for non-root users
      - [PATCH 3489387]: Install FreeBSD 10 header file (plus other missing
	versions)

    Linux:
      - PATCH: 3525998: Don't use an uninitialised value in error message
      - [PATCH 3536420]: Ensure snd/rcv memory buffers are suitably aligned
	Patch provided by Tyler Olmstead

    MinGW:
      - Net-SNMP Perl modules build again.
      - Support the directory structure of recent Shining Light OpenSSL
	binary distributions
      - Testing: Fix a race condition in the test framework
      - Testing: Fix a race condition in the test runner
      - Testing: Make test T130snmpv1vacmget_simple pass
      - Testing: Make those regression tests pass for which SNMPCONFPATH
	and/or SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR matter
      - Testing: Make unit-tests/T014gethostbyaddr_clib pass
      - Testing: Make unit-tests/T102pdu_build_clib pass.
      - Testing: Obtain the MSYS path from the environment

    Win32:
      - Avoid that compiling the header file <net-snmp/net-snmp-config.h>
	with the MinGW gcc compiler triggers warnings about "pragma
	comment".
      - Avoid that the PACKAGE_* macros defined in
	<net-snmp/net-snmp-config.h> cause trouble when including this
	header in a package that uses the GNU autotools.
      - Building: Builds now correctly with a 64-bit compiler. git-svn-id:
	file:///home/hardaker/lib/sf-bkups/net-snmp-convert-svnrepo/trunk@1
	9458 06827809-a52a-0410-b366-d66718629ded
      - Snmpd: Remove dlmod

    Windows:
      - Building (build.bat): Install netsnmp.dll before running the Perl
	regression tests such that the regression tests are run with the
	correct version of netsnmp.dll.
      - MSVC: Avoid that the typedefs in <net-snmp/net-snmp-config.h>
	conflict with those in <stdint.h> from the msinttypes project
      - MSVC: Link with proper libeay32 library
      - MSVC: When linking with OpenSSL, link with user32.lib too
      - Make netsnmp_large_fd_set_resize() robust against memory allocation
	failures. Make NETSNMP_LARGE_FD_ZERO() use memset() on Unix systems
	instead of an explicit loop. Make sure that on Unix systems
	netsnmp_large_fd_clr() doesn't try to read memory it isn't allowed
	to read if the first argument equals -1 (a value that shouldn't be
	passed by the caller). Make netsnmp_large_fd_is_set() return false
	on Unix systems if the first argument equals -1 (a value that
	shouldn't be passed by the caller). Make
	netsnmp_large_fd_set_resize() shrink behavior correct.
      - Perl (build.bat): When installing development files, install the
	PDB files too.
      - Remove superfluous link libraries from project files (*.dsp)
      - Snmptrapd: Make the IP address to hostname conversion work
      - Testing: perl: Fix an incorrect message printed while running the
	Perl module regression tests

      - [PATCH 3312861]: Man pages

    testing:
      - Changed
      - Check PID file existence after having read it instead of before.
	This fixes the race condition where the PID file disappeared after
	the existence check and before it was read.
      - Make the SNMP_VERBOSE=1 output even more verbose.

    unspecified:
      - minor NEWS polish

    Perl:
      - Remove file perl/NetSNMP.xs

    Win32:

    snmplib:
      - Added function netsnmp_delete_table_data_set().
      - Added function netsnmp_delete_table_data_set(). Added declaration
	for the function netsnmp_table_data_delete_table() in a public
	agent header file.
      - Added function netsnmp_delete_table_data_set(). Added declaration
	for the function netsnmp_table_data_delete_table() in a public
	agent header file. Fixed memory leak in
	netsnmp_table_data_delete_table().
      - Added function netsnmp_delete_table_data_set(). Added declaration
	for the function netsnmp_table_data_delete_table() in a public
	agent header file. Fixed memory leak in
	netsnmp_table_data_delete_table(). Fixed memory leak triggered by
	unregistering a table handler.
      - Added macro netsnmp_static_assert().
      - Added netsnmp_mib_handler.data_clone, a function pointer that
	defines how to clone netsnmp_mib_handler.myvoid. Must be defined if
	and only if data_free is set. The function netsnmp_handler_dup()
	does now clone MIB handler private data if data_clone() is set.
	Previously after duplicating a MIB handler and unregistering one of
	the two MIB handlers, the private data pointer (myvoid) of the
	other became a dangling pointer. Note: addition of
	netsnmp_mib_handler.data_clone is an ABI change.
      - Added snmp_sess_session_lookup().
      - Added the function netsnmp_check_definedness(), which helps to find
	the cause of undefined value errors as reported by Valgrind.
      - Avoid that Valgrind complains about uninitialized data for the
	buffers returned by netsnmp_callback_recv() and
	netsnmp_callback_hook_build().
      - Be const correct over calls to str* functions.
      - Changed the argument type of debug_register_tokens() from char *
	into const char *.
      - Check that the argument to netsnmp_transport_copy is non-NULL
      - Check the return value of strdup in netsnmp_create_data_list and
	fail if strdup fails.
      - Correct the extern "C" declarations to be consistent. Remove
	commented out code.
      - Fenner: fix sending of UDP responses from multihomed agents. Try to
	send the response as it was before Net-SNMP 5.6 (assuming the
	appropriate request was unicast) and only if it fails try to set
	if_index (the request must be broadcast).
      - Fixed bugs in asn_parse_unsigned_int64(),
	asn_build_unsigned_int64(), asn_parse_signed_int64() and
	asn_build_signed_int64(). Most but not all of these bugs were
	specific to 64-bit systems. Fixes bug #3093199.
      - Fixed memory leak triggered by calling se_add_pair_to_list() with a
	value that already existed in the list.
      - Invoking se_clear_slist() does no longer create a dangling pointer.
      - Invoking se_clear_slist() does no longer create a dangling pointer.
	Fixed leaks-at-exit triggered by using the snmp_enum code.
      - Invoking se_clear_slist() does no longer create a dangling pointer.
	Fixed leaks-at-exit triggered by using the snmp_enum code.
	Documented behavior of se_add_pair(), se_add_pair_to_slist() and
	clear_snmp_enum(). Made snmp_enum example consistent with the rest
	of the code by adding strdup() calls and added a call to
	se_clear_all_lists().
      - Invoking se_clear_slist() does no longer create a dangling pointer.
	Fixed leaks-at-exit triggered by using the snmp_enum code.
	Documented behavior of se_add_pair(), se_add_pair_to_slist() and
	clear_snmp_enum(). Made snmp_enum example consistent with the rest
	of the code by adding strdup() calls and added a call to
	se_clear_all_lists(). Fixed a memory corruption problem triggered
	by the (undocumented) snmpd.conf "enum" keyword handler - storing
	pointers to strings allocated on the stack in a global list does
	not work.
      - Remove the support for CMU compatibility since there is no way to
	enable it and nobody have missed it.

    snmp:
      - patch: 3096725: sysORTable registation for notification log mib
	original patch fixed several issues, other parts applied earlier

    snmpd:
      - Add missing function declaration
      - Added functions netsnmp_handler_owns_tabreq(),
	netsnmp_registration_owns_tabreq(), netsnmp_iterator_clone().
	Exported netsnmp_table_registration_info_clone().
      - Added functions netsnmp_handler_owns_tabreq(),
	netsnmp_registration_owns_tabreq(), netsnmp_iterator_clone().
	Exported netsnmp_table_registration_info_clone(). Modified
	netsnmp_iterator_delete_table() such that it frees the table
	registration information stored in a table iterator too. Modified
	netsnmp_get_table_iterator_handler() such that the table iterator
	passed to this function is freed when the associated handler is
	freed. Restored the behavior of netsnmp_get_table_handler() to that
	of r19449, that is, not setting up the data_free pointer because
	not all callers of netsnmp_get_table_handler() expect that table
	registration information is freed when the associated handler is
	freed.
      - Added netsnmp_get_table_iterator2().
      - Added netsnmp_get_table_iterator2(). Added
	netsnmp_register_table_iterator2().
      - Added netsnmp_get_table_iterator2(). Added
	netsnmp_register_table_iterator2(). Added
	netsnmp_handler_owns_iterator_info().
      - Added netsnmp_get_table_iterator2(). Added
	netsnmp_register_table_iterator2(). Added
	netsnmp_handler_owns_iterator_info(). Fixed leak-at-exit triggered
	by snmpNotifyTable.
      - Added netsnmp_get_table_iterator2(). Added
	netsnmp_register_table_iterator2(). Added
	netsnmp_handler_owns_iterator_info(). Fixed leak-at-exit triggered
	by snmpNotifyTable. Fixed leak-at-exit triggered by
	snmpTargetAddrTable. Also, restored backwards compatibility of
	netsnmp_register_table_iterator().
      - Added netsnmp_register_watched_instance2(),
	netsnmp_register_watched_scalar2(), netsnmp_clone_watcher_info()
	and netsnmp_owns_watcher_info(). See also the Doxygen comments for
	more info.
      - Added netsnmp_unregister_auto_data_table().
      - Added reference count in the netsnmp_baby_steps_modes data
	structure and made sure that this data structure is automatically
	freed when the handler that owns it is unregistered.
      - Added snmp_sess_session_lookup(). Call shutdown_master_agent() and
	shutdown_agent() during shutdown.
      - Added snmp_sess_session_lookup(). Call shutdown_master_agent() and
	shutdown_agent() during shutdown. The function clean_subtree() does
	no longer trigger double frees and invalid memory reads. Note: this
	function was already wrong at the time it was introduced (patch
	#724925 / r8531, July 2003).
      - Added snmp_sess_session_lookup(). Call shutdown_master_agent() and
	shutdown_agent() during shutdown. The function clean_subtree() does
	no longer trigger double frees and invalid memory reads. Note: this
	function was already wrong at the time it was introduced (patch
	#724925 / r8531, July 2003). Removed a comment in
	netsnmp_handler_free() that is now obsolete because of the
	clean_subtree() changes.
      - Added snmp_sess_session_lookup(). Call shutdown_master_agent() and
	shutdown_agent() during shutdown. The function clean_subtree() does
	no longer trigger double frees and invalid memory reads. Note: this
	function was already wrong at the time it was introduced (patch
	#724925 / r8531, July 2003). Removed a comment in
	netsnmp_handler_free() that is now obsolete because of the
	clean_subtree() changes. Modified netsnmp_deregister_agent_nsap()
	such that it never examines sessions that already have been closed.
	It is for this change that it was necessary to introduce the new
	function snmp_sess_session_lookup().
      - Added the functions netsnmp_duplicate_variable() and
	netsnmp_cache_handler_owns_cache().
      - Added the functions netsnmp_duplicate_variable() and
	netsnmp_cache_handler_owns_cache(). Memory allocated by
	netsnmp_register_old_api() for storing SNMP variables is now freed
	when the associated handler is unregistered.
      - Added the functions netsnmp_duplicate_variable() and
	netsnmp_cache_handler_owns_cache(). Memory allocated by
	netsnmp_register_old_api() for storing SNMP variables is now freed
	when the associated handler is unregistered. Callback function data
	deallocation does no longer free the memory allocated for the
	AgentX session - the memory that was allocated for AgentX sessions
	is now deallocated just as that for any other session. This fixes a
	leak-at-exit.
      - Added the functions netsnmp_duplicate_variable() and
	netsnmp_cache_handler_owns_cache(). Memory allocated by
	netsnmp_register_old_api() for storing SNMP variables is now freed
	when the associated handler is unregistered. Callback function data
	deallocation does no longer free the memory allocated for the
	AgentX session - the memory that was allocated for AgentX sessions
	is now deallocated just as that for any other session. This fixes a
	leak-at-exit. Notify filter table: Callback function data
	deallocation does no longer free the data in *	  
	*snmpNotifyFilterTable_if_ctx.container - this is now done by  
	shutdown_snmpNotifyFilterTable() and
      - Automatically free the private data structure allocated by
	netsnmp_container_table_handler_get().
      - Builds with most recent MinGW (having #define localtime_r).
      - Count the number of users of a netsnmp_cache data structure instead
	of duplicating it.
      - Declare the OID argument type of MIB registration functions as
	'const oid *' instead of 'oid *' since these functions do not
	modify the OID.
      - Do not leak the limits of scalar_group objects on shutdown.
      - Extend the documentation for data_clone and data_free
      - Factor out common config_add_mib statments
      - Find out whether librpm is available before configuring the agent
	modules because host/data/access/swinst needs symbol HAVE_LIBRPM.
	As a result, configure has to be run only once instead of twice to
	enable the hrSWInstalled table on systems that have librpm.
      - Fixed a double free at exit that was triggered by cleaning up the
	data structures used for embedded Perl support.
      - Fixed a year-2038 bug in the implementation of ipRouteTable.
      - Introduced netsnmp_pid_t.
      - MIB-specific leak-at-exit fixes.
      - Make it possible to copy watched data items without memory leaks.
      - Make the setting of the argvrestart* variables optional on
	USING_UTIL_FUNCS_RESTART_MODULE.
      - Make the setting of the argvrestart* variables optional on
	USING_UTIL_FUNCS_RESTART_MODULE. Remove util_funcs/restart from the
	requirement sets of util_funcs and default_modules.
      - Make the setting of the argvrestart* variables optional on
	USING_UTIL_FUNCS_RESTART_MODULE. Remove util_funcs/restart from the
	requirement sets of util_funcs and default_modules. Add
	util_funcs/restart to the requirement set of ucd-snmp/versioninfo.
      - Patch 3141462: from fenner: fix agentx subagent issues with
	multiple-object requests
      - Patch from Niels to fix VACM persistant storage.
      - Remove unused variable cmp
      - Remove util_funcs/Exit from the requirement sets of util_funcs and
	default_modules.
      - Remove util_funcs/Exit from the requirement sets of util_funcs and
	default_modules. Never use Exit to terminate the agent.
      - Removing the last cache via netsnmp_cache_remove() does no longer
	trigger a crash.
      - Update the length of sysObjectID as well as the data when it is set
	from a configuration file.
      - Use the same autoconf symbol to decide both if strcasecmp should be
	declared and if it should be defined.

	corruption by invoking select().
      - [PATCH ]: optimizations for large route tables from Stephen
	Hemminger applied parts 1-3 of 4 from him (msgs to coders on
	2/28/11; subject ip-forward-mib performance improvements; part 4
	needs more work
      - add debug for cert find hint as string/int
      - add newly created/destroyed interfaces to ipv6IfTable The list of
	interfaces was never refreshed, now it is reloaded every time the
	table is accessed. I've also fixed a memory leak and optimized the
	loading of the list a bit.
      - com2sec6 directive: If configure has not found getaddrinfo(),
	non-numeric IPv6 addresses do now trigger an error message.
      - don't second-guess cache handler (waves hand) this is not the
	function you are looking for. netsnmp_cache_is_valid() is not meant
	for mib modules
      - example MIB: Added shutdown function that frees all memory owned by
	this MIB implementation.
      - fix double free in TLS error handling
      - fixed the agent writing 'looks like a 64bit wrap, but prev!=new' in
	syslog when computing ipSystemStats Without the memcpy,
	prev_vals->stats and new_vals->stats could get different, which
	could much much later (when a counter gets bigger than 32 bits)
	result in 'prev!=new' message in syslog. Typically this happens
	after long time of uptime and it is very hard to reproduce.
      - host/data_access/swinst_rpm: Fixed a memory leak in
	netsnm_swinst_arch_init().
      - host/data_access/swinst_rpm: Pass correct path to rpmdbOpen() such
	that opening the database succeeds.
      - host/data_access/swinst_rpm: Pass correct path to rpmdbOpen() such
	that opening the database succeeds. host/data_access/swinst_rpm:
	Log an error message if rpmdbOpen() fails.
      - instead of relying on NETSNMP_DS_LIB_APPTYPE, break out cert table
	inits to new agent cert init function, called from init_agent.
      - netsnmp_cache_free(): A more detailed message is now logged when
	attempting to free a cache that is still in the cache list.
      - reworked hrStorageTable to support large filesystems. The
	hrStorageAllocationUnits does not report real allocation unit size,
	but some calculated value so hrStorageAllocationUnits *
	hrStorageSize gives real size of the filesystem. This calculation
	happens only when hrStorageSize is too small (32bits) for
	filesystem size, e.g. filesystems larger than 8TB with 4096 bytes
	block size. This calculation can be turned off by
	'realStorageUnits' config option.
      - skip non-AF_INET interfaces when loading ipv4 addrs
      - snmpd is again single-threaded. [PATCH 2959811]: Safranek:
	Reimplement Linux Netlink IPv6 prefix listener.
      - Fixed memory leak in TCP-MIB tables introduced by patch #3053436.
      - Fixed memory leak in TCP-MIB tables introduced by patch #3053436."
	[PATCH 3053436]: from: takevos: fix: tcpConnectionTable_data_access
	invalid memory access" the bug 3053436 is fixing was introduced in
	r17719, and fixed in r17861.
      - Use proper format specifier in debug statements for printing values
	of type 'oid'.
      - [PATCH 3066862]: fix the agent for comparing unsigned large indexes
	of the disk and extend tables.
      - fixed hrSWRunPath of swapped-out processes on Linux.   fgets()
	returns NULL both when /proc/PID/cmdline is empty (= swapped out)
	and when the process exited after fopen(), so check
	/proc/PID/status in both cases.
      - fixed race condition in hrSWRunTable Treat the reads from
	/proc/<pid>/* carefuly, processes can exit in the middle of
	processing. (already fixed in V5-5-patches and V5-4-patches in SVN
	rev. 20115, dunno why I did not patch trunk)

    snmptrapd:
      - Fixed a double free at exit that was triggered by cleaning up the
	data structures used for embedded Perl support. Fixed a double free
	at exit that was triggered by cleaning up the data structures used
	for embedded Perl support. Valgrind reported that double free as

    apps:
      - [PATCH 3054817]: Adds per-variable timed output support to snmpwalk
	using -CT
      - add snmp.conf tokens for timeouts and retries

    build:

      - Make it possible to regenerate using autoconf 2.68.
      - Some systems do not support the -E flag to grep, use autoconf to
	find the right egrep at all times.
      - check for /dev/kmem instead of assuming it exists and hardcoding
	when it is not there

    libnetsnmp:
      - made the SSH transport configurable as it should be.

    libnetsnmpmibs:

      - [PATCH 3211484]: Support enumerations in notification varbinds
      - make the mib2c foreach ranges work as advertised in the comments.

    packaging:
      - Enable micro-and-macro-feature management within Net-SNMP; this
	adds a number of new flags to configure (--enable-minimalist and
	--enable-read-only). These changes are designed to remove much of
	the inline code that isn't always necessary or desired. Scripts
	exist (and will be improved) to stip out unused components from the
	code entirely to enable a shorter review process for upgrading to
	new releases. This work was done by Wes Hardaker and Michael Baer
	from SPARTA, Inc. but is being checked in as a large patch since
	converting the micro patches from git to svn turend out to be
	impossible

    patch 3140833:
      - fix proxy GETNEXT requests When OIDs requested are below the proxy
	request remap, we need to not include any OIDs that might be in the
	space between the original OID and the remapped OID. This patch
	fudges the request so that it fixes the request OID so it's just

    patch 3184026:
      - Avoid constant refresh of interface statistics

    perl:
      - patch 3049029: from fennec: fix a memory leak with snmp bulkwalks
      - patch from Martin Buck: don't always open stderr as the calls to
	snmp_log already do this and it messes up the agent when embedded

    python:
      - [PATCH 3185085]: Fix segfault on 64-bit systems
      - [BUG 3295407]: Fix handling of void pointer

    testing:
      - Add missing preconditions
      - Added function netsnmp_delete_table_data_set(). Added declaration
	for the function netsnmp_table_data_delete_table() in a public
	agent header file. Fixed memory leak in
	netsnmp_table_data_delete_table(). Fixed memory leak triggered by
	unregistering a table handler. Unit tests can now invoke functions
	from libagent.
      - Added function netsnmp_delete_table_data_set(). Added declaration
	for the function netsnmp_table_data_delete_table() in a public
	agent header file. Fixed memory leak in
	netsnmp_table_data_delete_table(). Fixed memory leak triggered by
	unregistering a table handler. Unit tests can now invoke functions
	from libagent. Added unit test for table_dataset.
      - Added inet_ntop() and inet_pton() unit test.
      - Added netsnmp_mib_handler.data_clone, a function pointer that
	defines how to clone netsnmp_mib_handler.myvoid. Must be defined if
	and only if data_free is set. The function netsnmp_handler_dup()
	does now clone MIB handler private data if data_clone() is set.
	Previously after duplicating a MIB handler and unregistering one of
	the two MIB handlers, the private data pointer (myvoid) of the
	other became a dangling pointer. Note: addition of
	netsnmp_mib_handler.data_clone is an ABI change. added more test
	cases to the handler registration test.
      - Generate a normal #line directive as per C99 instead of the
	compiler-specific #<n>-directive.
      - Introduced new test type next to capp and clib: cagentlib.
      - It is again possible to run an individual test via the script
	testing/RUNTESTS.
      - It is now possible to analyze the unit tests with Valgrind by
	setting the environment variables SNMP_SAVE_TMPDIR and
	DYNAMIC_ANALYZER. An example: (export SNMP_SAVE_TMPDIR=yes
	DYNAMIC_ANALYZER="valgrind --trace-children=yes --leak-check=full";
	cd testing && ./RUNFULLTESTS -g unit-tests)
      - Test 71 (com2sec6_simple) does now succeed even if IPv6 DNS
	resolution is not available.
      - Test T030 does now pass on MinGW.
      - auto-create user specified SNMP_TMPDIR and SNMP_TMP_PERSISTENTDIR
	too; default SNMP_TMP_PERSISTENDIR based on SNMP_TMPDIR for user
	specified SNMP_TMPDIR

    man:

      - agent: ipNetToPhysicalTable: Do not log an error message if one or
	more interfaces are present that do not have such information
	(NUD_NOARP), e.g. tunnels. Reported by Stephen Hemminger. See also
	patch #3107003.
      - snmpd is again single-threaded.

    MinGW:
      - Made regression test output independent of the Net-SNMP variables
	defined in the Windows registry. Some tests that failed previously
	after the Net-SNMP binaries (MSVC build) had been installed do now
	pass.
      - configure: Detection of the functions gai_strerror(),
	getaddrinfo(), gethostbyname() and gethostname() does now succeed.
      - testing: If the agent has been asked to stop, wait until the snmpd
	process disappeared before proceeding.
      - Tests 025 and 026 pass on MinGW even if winExtDLL has been enabled.

    NetBSD:
      - DragonFly support [From NetBSD patch archive]

    OpenBSD:
      - Update SWRun code to use kvm_getproc2 [From OpenBSD patch archive]

    Win32:
      - Avoid that MSVC reports a warning message about redefinition of the
	malloc() macro during building the Net-SNMP source code.
      - Deprecated libsnmp.def - add NETSNMP_IMPORT to function
	declarations instead to export a function from netsnmp.dll.
      - Guard netsnmp_udp_recvfrom() etc. declarations consistently. Builds
	with Visual Studio 2010.
      - Introduced netsnmp_pid_t. Eliminated casts between int and HANDLE
	in agent/mibgroup/util_funcs.c and
	agent/mibgroup/ucd-snmp/pass_persist.c.
      - When snmpd.exe is started in a command prompt window, the snmpd
	process now stops upon the first key press. This makes it easier to
	debug snmpd.exe for memory leaks.
      - [PATCH 3085187]: Building via the Microsoft Visual Studio project
	file (.dsw/.dsp) works again.
      - [PATCH 3293842]: Eliminate registry argument limit of 127
	characters (this limitation was reported by Sylvain Dery).
      - building: Avoid that MSVC 2010 prints a warning message about
	redefining EADDRINUSE.
      - building: Builds now correctly with a 64-bit compiler.
      - building: batch build with OpenSSL enabled and with recent OpenSSL
	development files works again.
      - header file <net-snmp/net-snmp-config.h> can now be used in the
	MinGW environment.
      - testing: Avoid that T200 fails on known Microsoft SNMP extension
	DLL bugs.
      - Build snmplib/transports/snmpIPv6BaseDomain.c only if
	NETSNMP_ENABLE_IPV6 has been defined.
      - Fixed a memory leak in the Net-SNMP (non-winExtDLL) implementation
	of the MIB-II ipNetToMediaTable.
      - Microsoft Visual Studio: Link with gdi32.lib if OpenSSL has been
	enabled because gdi32.lib is a dependency of OpenSSL.

*5.6*

    snmplib:
      - Add const declarations to the disabled versions of the debugging
	code as well.
      - Add missing dependencies between transports.
      - Add missing symbol netsnmp_snmpSSHDomain_len, make
	netsnmp_snmpSSHDomain const.
      - Change oid to be a 32-bit type on ILP64 and LP64 platforms.
      - Change the parsing of ranges to accept all valid values.
      - Correct dependencies between transports. Remove unnecessary
	includes.
      - Correct the spelling of __cplusplus when checking if the file
	should be wrapped in extern "C".
      - Do not require that the UDP transport is included.
      - Fix agent crash when sending encrypted SNMPv3 traps. Reported by
	Srikapilan Gandhi
      - Fix responding to broadcast requests. UDP responses are sent with
	source IP address which was destination of appropriate requests
	(implemented in SVN rev. 15215). But if the destination of a
	request is broadcast IP address, the request was sent with the
	broadcast address as source. sendmsg() on Linux does not support
	this and returns error -> response is not sent. In order to send
	responses from the same interface, interface index of the
	appropriate interface must be used.
      - Install library/oid.h. Thanks to "Tomasz Lis" who spotted the bug.
      - Make the context argument of send_v3trap,
	send_trap_vars_with_context and netsnmp_send_traps refer to a const
	char*.
      - Make the name argument to find_varbind_in_list const
      - Prevent gcc ped-warning for NETSNMP_REMOVE_CONST
      - Remove declarations of functions that don't exist or are declared
	elsewhere.
      - Remove the oid typedef from <net-snmp/library/asn1.h>. It is still
	present in <net-snmp/types.h>, use that file.
      - Replace the debugging functions with dummies when debugging is
	disabled.
      - Revert 17808, instead factor out the declaration of oid to it's own
	file and include that file from both types.h and asn1.h
      - Use a void argument for the data argument of xdump.
      - [BUG 2919320]: Avoid accessing freed memory Reported by Tomasz Lis
      - [BUG 2922390]: Fix test for missing contextName parameter
      - [PATCH 2871747]: plug memory leak in OID processing. The memory
	leaked when small OID, which could fit pre-allocated vp->name_loc,
	was placed in different (allocated) one.
      - [PATCH 2942940]: Add a new function, netsnmp_parse_args, that is
	like snmp_parse_args but takes an additional bitmask, flags, to
	affect the behaviour. Also remove the magic handling of some
	application names.
      - [PATCH 2971270]: refuse to parse ASN.1 tokens with wrong type
	field. This may yield to problems with third-party applications
	which may depend on parsing ugly ASN.1 data - we'll see...
      - add function to validate RowStatus and StorageType varbinds - also
	remove some duplicate code and fix comments indent mangled
      - add functions to remove list/row data from request list
      - add interface for duplicating a container
      - add interface for duplicating a container container changes: add
	flags field to container meta-data; chg binary_array container to
	use container meta-data flags
      - add remove function to container iterator; implement it for
	binary_array
      - added the functions netsnmp_malloc(), netsnmp_calloc(),
	netsnmp_realloc(), netsnmp_strdup() and netsnmp_free().
      - builds again when HAVE_GETADDRINFO is not defined.
      - conf files can now include other conf files - also tweaked debug
	tokens here and there
      - create indexes for certificates in config path
      - directory container enhancements - fix potential memory leak - add
	filter callback to filter files returned - add option to return
	relative and not full paths - add option to sort returned list -
	add option to return empty container instead of NULL if no files
	found - change default container name to directory that was scanned
	- tweak debug/log messages
      - enhance file utils and dir utils - add optional stats struct to
	netsnmp_file - generalize dir container filter, add context to
	callback - add option to store netsnmp_files (w/stats) in container
	instead of just name
      - fix potential double free in CONTAINER_FREE - also added several
	compare routines
      - netsnmp_container enhancements: - add free_item function; defaults
	to netsnmp_container_simple_free - add CONTAINER_FREE_ALL
	macro/function (like CONTAINER_CLEAR but calls container free_item
	for each item in primary container) - add ability to set options on
	binary_array containers
      - new certificate api to support tls/dtls
      - new snmp token logOption allows specifying log destinations vi conf
	files - if stderr log enabled because of no log destination, turn
	it off when a log destination is enabled - don't call
	netsnmp_enable_stderrlog() from apps anymore
      - obsoleted NETSNMP_DS_LIB_ALARM_DONT_USE_SIG. From now on using
	SIGALRM to trigger Net-SNMP alarm handlers is no longer supported.
	Motivation: as known libnetsnmp supports time-based alarms via the
	functions snmp_alarm_register(), run_alarms() and other functions.
	Two different ways to trigger the function run_alarms() are
	supported inside libnetsnmp: 1. By making sure that the timeout
	argument of select() is small enough such that select() returns
	before the next alarm must be handled (when the variable
	NETSNMP_DS_LIB_ALARM_DONT_USE_SIG is set to one, which is the
	default). 2. By making sure that the kernel fires SIGALRM at the
	time when run_alarms() should be called (when the variable
	NETSNMP_DS_LIB_ALARM_DONT_USE_SIG is set to zero, which has to be
	configured explicitly). The following issues are associated with
	the second approach: 1. Alarm functions are used inside Net-SNMP to
	e.g. refresh cached table contents. As far as I can see there is
	nothing in the Net-SNMP source code that prevents the following
	from happening: a table refresh triggered via SIGALRM while a row
	is being removed from a cached table. This can result in dangling
	pointer dereferences and even a crash. 2. POSIX restricts signal
	handlers to calling functions that are either reentrant or
	non-interruptible
	(http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/xsh_chap02
	_04.html#tag_02_04). Standard I/O functions like printf() and
	fprintf() are neither reentrant nor non-interruptible. run_alarms()
	is called from inside a signal handler, which means that this
	restriction applies to the function run_alarms() itself and all
	functions called by it (which includes the alarm callback
	functions). Or: e.g. snmp_log() and its callers must not be called
	from inside run_alarms() when this function is invoked from inside
	a signal handler. This is a severe restriction, and one that is
	hard to work with. 3. Not all software developers know how to make
	sure that signal delivery works correctly in a multithreaded
	context. POSIX does not guarantee to which thread a signal like
	SIGALRM will be delivered, unless that signal has been blocked
	before thread creation and is unblocked after thread creation (see
	also
	http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_sig
	mask.html). This is relevant for the Net-SNMP project not only
	because a worker thread is created inside
	agent/mibgroup/if-mib/data_access/interface_linux.c but also
	because libnetsnmp is often used inside multithreaded software.
	Currently no attempt is made to make sure that SIGALRM is processed
	by the Net-SNMP event processing loop thread. If SIGALRM is
	processed by another thread, this will result in one or more data
	races. Because all the difficulties associated with processing
	alarms from inside a signal handler function, and because fixing
	these would require more effort than it is worth,
	NETSNMP_DS_LIB_ALARM_DONT_USE_SIG has been deprecated and from now
	on approach (1) is the only supported approach to trigger alarm
	handlers.
      - plit snmpIPBaseDomain and move the IPv4 parts to IPv4Base and the
	socket generic parts to SocketBase.
      - when freeing a cache, stop timer and call cache free func - also
	add netsnmp_cache_remove
      - new experimental simple state machine
      - new experimental simple state machine new experimental row creation
	API which uses a state machine to try really hard to create a row
	from a given varbind list
      - fix issue with USM using inactive users
      - fixed potential buffer overflow when generating temp. file names
      - implemented a fix for the issue reported in patch #3042770. Created
	a snmp_select_info_flags function, and similar, that allow for
	alarms to not be run. This is then used in the synch_response
	functions to avoid 100% CPU loops
      - patch: 3042770: from mehaf: Made run_alarms() reentrant
      - when displaying a byte as single digit hex value, default to
	prefixing with 0 unless there is a seperator or addition hint data
      - 0 patch 3058645: from jorisesaturnus: modified version of the patch
	to use MSG_DONTWAIT for the unix domain socket
      - [PATCH 3067540]: Fix IPv4 OID indexes on 64-bit big-endian systems.

    snmplib, snmpd:
      - Do not check if values of type size_t are less than 0.
      - Make sure that a mask is given to open when O_CREAT is specified

    snmplib, snmpd, snmpnetstat:
      - Add correct size prefixes when printing variables of type oid.

    snmpd:
      - Add support of network interfaces with HW address bigger than 6
	bytes to ipNetToMediaTable and ipNetToPhysicalTable. Some HW, like
	InfiniBand, uses HW addresses with 9 and more bytes. Snmpd on Linux
	was not able to parse /proc/net/arp then and produced ugly 'ioctl
	35123 returned -1' to log.
      - Check the range of oid values towards the maximum oid value,
	notULONG_MAX
      - Extract the Exit and restart* subroutines from util_func in order
	to make it possible to build less code for the minimal case.
      - Fixed creation of views using snmpusm, OIDs with indexes > 255 are
	allowed now. This reverts SVN commit #7492.
      - Fixed invalid access to memory in TCP-MIB This partly reverts patch
	17719 - the entries *are* used after raw_data container is freed.
	These entries should be freed when associated rowreq_ctx is freed.
      - Fixed logging of 'truncating integer value > 32 bits' in IP-MIB and
	TCP-MIB The counters, which grow fast are now cut to 32bits.
      - Fixed udpTable indexes on big-endian 64bit Linux. The index was
	always '0.0.0.0' instead of real local IP address.
      - Made subtree_context_cache::context_name a const char*.
      - Make all the oids and oid lengths in agent_trap.c const and use
	them from everywhere.
      - Make the enterprise argument of netsnmp_send_traps and
	send_enterprise_trap_vars const
      - Only enable hostSwInst rpm support on linux hosts with librpm. This
	makes it possible to build on non-rpm linux distributions.
      - Removed the unused function xx_tokenize_exec_command from
	utilities/execute.

	Patch from Andreas Jaeger/Leonardo Chiquitto
      - agent will no longer call table handlers if a set request for the
	handler has invalid indexes
      - agent will no longer call table handlers if a set request for the
	handler has invalid indexes don't call cleanup on first request on
	bad indexes. instead, set actual error later, and free request data
	sets on first request for sets
      - define and use new NETSNMP_LOGONCE macro
      - fix crash in IF-MIB and IP-MIB when there are some interfaces with
	broadcast IP address and some without. Reset the bcastentry in the
	loop, so it cannot be inserted to the twice. Without this patch,
	when an interface without broadcast address is processed, the
	bcastaddress from previous loop is inserted into the container.
	This obviously fails and the bcastentry is freed, but the container
	still contains reference to it -> SIGSEGV.
      - fix memory leak in ipAddressPrefixTable -
	net_snmp_search_update_prefix_info returns different code, when the
	entry was not inserted to list and can be freed.
      - fix rare race condition when reading RPM database. Old rpm versions
	return NULL instead of Header when another RPM instance holds
	database locks. I.e. snmpd sometimes crashes when reading hr_swInst
	and rpm is installing/updating/removing another package. As a
	solution, whole RPM cache is thrown away and re-read when we got an
	error from librpm. The whole process is restarted only three times,
	to prevent endless loop.
      - fixed a memory leak in TCP-MIB.
      - fixed filedescriptor leak in Etherlike-MIB and RMON-MIB
      - fixed memory leak when reading sensors for LM-SENSORS-MIB.
      - fixed one leak-at-exit.
      - include local port number in packet dumps. An example: Received 36

      - patch 2825653: from bru5ce: fix sendmail.cf parsing in certain
	conditions
      - Log before returning.
      - [PATCH 3053428]: fix get_pid_from_inode when the inode is not
	found.
      - [PATCH 3058140]: check that inode is non-zero
      - patch 3062526: from mariog85: fix security engineID setting in the
	trapsess directive

    snmpdlib:
      - new functions to make stash ptr and newrow available to
	table_dataset handlers nonews: fix typo; tabs to spaces; use sizeof
	instead of constant

    snmpdx:
      - changed default TCP target from 0.0.0.0:705 to localhost:705. This
	is not only a more secure choice but it also makes it possible on
	Windows systems to let an AgentX subagent connect to an AgentX
	master agent running on the same system without having to set the
	variable NETSNMP_DS_AGENT_X_SOCKET.

    snmptable:
      - [BUG 2837998]: Handle missing instance subidentifiers in results
      - [PATCH 2850067]: Suppress extraneous "index" header token Patch
	supplied by Dan Nelson

    snmpusm:
      - Prefer to use a variable of the right type over an ugly cast.
	Lessen the scope of the variable as well.
      - patch from Martin Bjorklund to add a -Cw option to use
	createAndWait for agents that are strict about not allowing a row
	to be set to active until the authentication password has been
	changed; plus white-space clean up, manual additions and help
	output modifications by hardaker
      - Correct ifdefs, remove dead variables.

    man:
      - clean up manual pages (from Debian patch 56_manpage)

    snmpwalk:
      - Handle the case when the end oid is longer than the current oid
	correctly

    apps:
      - Add command to send AgentX notify requests to a master agent.
      - Generic host-specific configuration snmp.conf files are now read.
	See the HOST-SPECIFIC FILES section of the snmp.conf manual page.
      - Only build agentxtrap if the agentx libraries are built. Add a test
	case for agentxtrap. The enablement/disablement is inspired by
	automake conditionals
      - T command line flag can be used to configure transports
      - A new 'snmptls' command for manipulating the agent's TLS configuration

    apps, snmplib:
      - [PATCH 2835577]: identified by "Bart Van Assche": Replace SNMP_ZERO
	of arrays with a memset.

    snmptranslate:
      - fixed printing of ranges with UNSIGNED type.

    build:
      - [PATCH 2952020]: Explicitly set permission on temporary testing
	output directories. Patch provided by Leonardo Chiquitto.
      - run rpm configure checks for hr_swinst rewrite (rpm version only)
      - Do not call vacm_standard_views() or init_vacm_config_tokens() if
	the corresponding module was not compiled (from Debian patch
	61_vacm_missing_dependency_check)
      - Fix ipv6 generic case so test matches verification

    building:
      - 'make test TESTOPTS="-P tcp"' works fine now
      - 0 In case exec_prefix is unset then set it to '${prefix}' in order
	to pick up overrides of $prefix in make install.
      - Building Net-SNMP with dmalloc support enabled is again possible.
      - Do not link with libnetsnmphelpers any more as it is empty.
      - Fixed compilation with rpm-4.6. Turn on the legacy API when rpm-4.6
	is detected.
      - Introduced the variable 'with_socklib' in the configure script.
	This variable is set to "winsock2" for MinGW and to "default" for
	all other systems. Winsock2 tests are only run if this variable is
	set to "winsock2" (MinGW).
      - OS header detection check is now run before IPv6 stack detection.
      - Use AC_REPLACE_FUNCS to handle code that is missing on some
	platforms.
      - Use autoconf to decide if inet_ntop.c and inet_pton.c are to be
	compiled.
      - Use the same compiler command and flags for building of tests as
	for building of the code, thus enabling test of e.g. 32-bit code
	compiled on a 64-bit platform.
      - abort if the file program could not be found, since this is
	essential for proper operation of libtool.
      - added detection of lm_sensors version. I am not Autoconf guru, so I
	hope I got it right. The goal is to define NETSNMP_USE_SENSORS_V3
	*before* config_modules_agent processes
	agent/mibgroup/hardware/sensors.h.
      - made sure that the configure script does no longer invoke "tail
	-1", which is not POSIX-compliant.
      - save configure cache every once in while
      - update Version-Munge for renamed configure.ac
      - when generating a default value for the system location and no
	domain name is found in /etc/resolv.conf, use "@no.where" instead
	of "".
      - Add new test* entries from the testing Makefile.in to the top-level
	Makefile.in

    building, Win32:
      - Remove a few unused configure symbols

    hpux:
      - fix build error on HP-UX 10.20

    libnetsnmp:
      - Support for a stream-line stripped down version of internal OpenSSL
	support using --with-openssl=internal

    libnetsnmpagent, libnetsnmphelpers:
      - moved the functions netsnmp_bulk_to_next_fix_requests(),
	netsnmp_get_bulk_to_next_handler(), netsnmp_register_null(),
	netsnmp_register_null_context() and netsnmp_register_old_api() from
	libnetsnmphelpers to libnetsnmpagent. Notes: - This does not affect
	backwards compatibility for applications that link with
	$(net-snmp-config --agent-libs) since this involves linking with
	both libnetsnmphelpers and libnetsnmpagent. - Functions have been
	moved between libraries by moving entire source files.

    library:
      - [PATCH 2952140]: Overflow counter32 and gauge32 on 64bit systems
	correctly Patch provided by Leonardo Chiquitto

    libsnmp:
      - changed the type of the fourth argument of netsnmp_set_row_column()
	from const char* to const void* such that no cast is necessary when
	passing another datatype then char* or const char*.

    man:
      - [BUG 2972860]: Update broken references

    mib2c:
      - Remove unnecessary casts to u_char*
      - [BUG 2888569]: Fix generation of table columns array
      - mib2c can now optionally run sed on generated code
      - table_data template enhancements - add error checks during table
	init - create cache earlier so we can bail on failure - add option
	to create/delete row w/out adding/removing from container
      - update inline documentation; add storagetype test for columns

    mibs:
      - [BUG 2973890]: Fix imports, DiskIOEntry list and revision histories
      - patch 2974716: from bvassche: fix issues in the SMUX-MIB

    misc:
      - [PATCH 2836112]: Use the right modifier when printing size_t and
	ssize_t variables.
      - [PATCH 2952708]: Osterkamp: Added Perl implementation of BRIDGE-MIB

    perl:
      - NetSNMP::agent::netsnmp_request_infoPtr::getValue(): don't return a
	pointer to a buffer on the stack. How can this have worked reliably
	?? NetSNMP::agent::netsnmp_request_infoPtr::setValue(),
	ASN_COUNTER64: fixed bug that could cause this method to fail even
	when a valid number was provided.
      - [PATCH 2890931]: Better handling of Counter64 values. Patch
	provided by Max Romanov.
      - fixed a memory leak triggered by destroying a
	NetSNMP::agent::netsnmp_handler_registration object.
      - fixed a memory leak triggered by destroying a
	NetSNMP::agent::netsnmp_handler_registration object. fixed a memory
	leak triggered by failure of creating a NetSNMP::OID object.
      - fixed a memory leak triggered by destroying a
	NetSNMP::agent::netsnmp_handler_registration object. fixed a memory
	leak triggered by failure of creating a NetSNMP::OID object. fixed
	a memory leak triggered by the NetSNMP::OID::gettable() subroutine.
      - fixed a memory leak triggered by destroying a
	NetSNMP::agent::netsnmp_handler_registration object. fixed a memory
	leak triggered by failure of creating a NetSNMP::OID object. fixed
	a memory leak triggered by the NetSNMP::OID::gettable() subroutine.
	fixed an out-of-bounds array access triggered by the implementation
	of NetSNMP::SNMP. fixed a memory leak triggered by a PDU processing
	error in NetSNMP::SNMP. fixed memory leaks triggered by creating an
	SNMPv3 session via NetSNMP::SNMP. Also fixed the uninitialized
	variable accesses triggered by adding a varbind to a PDU via
	NetSNMP::SNMP introduced a few days ago. The bugs mentioned above
	have been found by inspecting the output of the following shell
	command: cd perl && valgrind --trace-children=yes --leak-check=full
	make test

    python:
      - [BUG 2919379]: Initialise SNMP sessions properly Provided by Diego
	Billi
      - [PATCH 2001656]: Handle null-termination of string values properly.
	Based on the principles of the patch from Tommy Beadle.
      - Support null-bytes in octet strings Patch supplied by Tommy Beadle
      - [PATCH 3035328]: from: sws: check the results of session creation
	for a failure case.
      - patch 3035578: from sws: keep error codes up to date

    testing:
      - Brand new test suite desigened to eventually test more
	functionality, provide for support of unit-tests and support of API
	tests
      - Change the test suite to work even if mib lookup is disabled.
      - Check the size of sun_path and use that to generate the maximal
	size strings for stressing com2secunix.
      - Make it possible to run the test suite from anywhere. Change the -D
	option to expect the path of the top source directory. Add an
	-srcdir option that is an alias for -D. Add an -builddir option to
	designate the directory where the test object is. Put srcdir and
	builddir in the environment for the test scripts Factor out the
	grep part of SKIPIF and SKIPIFNOT to ISDEFINED Use more readable
	keys in the opts hash in RUNFULLTESTS Adjust everything to use
	srcdir and builddir
      - Move the setting of MIBDIRS from the support script to the drivers
	since it is needed for the C tests as well.
      - Use olducd_run, not run_olducd. Change srcdir to refer to the top
	directory and not the testing subdirectory as that is what is
	expected in the test scripts.
      - add the test name to the start of the file "invoked".
      - made it possible to analyze all code covered by the regression
	tests with a dynamic analyzer, at least if that analyzer supports
	following child processes. An example:	 rm -rf /tmp/snmp-test-*
	make -s SNMP_SAVE_TMPDIR=yes DYNAMIC_ANALYZER="valgrind
	--trace-children=yes --track-origins=yes" make -s test grep -i
	uninitialised /tmp/snmp-test-* | xargs less

    unspecified:
      - Change the types of the return values of netsnmp_*_getSecName from
	char* to const char* since they point into internal structures.
      - Hide most functions and variables in the logmatch module. Cleaned
	up the header accordingly. Remove the need for forward declarations
	by reordering the functions.
      - Make the lists of com2Sec*Entries static
      - [BUG 2838243]: Correct the output of unsigned values. Thanks to
	Jack Huang of Qualcomm who pointed out this bug.
      - [BUG 2969872]: made sure that SOCK_STARTUP is invoked before
	init_agent() on Windows.
      - [BUG 2971257]: Fixed winExtDLL handling of multi-varbind getNext
	requests with OIDs in reverse lexicographical order.
      - [PATCH 2926374]: from Ed Swierk: fixed reading of ipAddressTable
	from /proc/net/if_inet6 on Linux The kernel might provide longer
	fields, especially on 64-bit systems.
      - [PATCH 2952034]: Return of the Great SuSE 'sprintf' Hunt... Patch
	supplied by Leonardo Chiquitto
      - add functions to get fingerprint from cert and log openssl errs
      - added a new DEBUGTRACETOK() macro
      - correctly calculate ifXTable.ifHCInUcastPkts on 32-bit Linux Linux
	does not provide standalone counter for incoming unicast packets
	(iucast) - it provides counter of all packets (iall) + separate
	counter for the multicast ones (imcast). Previous implementation of
	ifTable read these counters and calculated iucast = iall - imcast
	*before* these values were expanded into 64bits. This produced
	errors on 32bit systems when iall overflowed to zero and imcast was
	nozero -> iucast got negative and 'c64 32 bit check failed' error
	in snmpd log. Now the agent expands these values to 64bits first
	and *	  *then* performs    the calculation, using a new flag. 
	2010-05-27 08:18  magfr
      - fixed memory leak in RMON-MIB and ETHERLIKE-MIB when there are
	multiple aliases of an network interface Rationale: the aliased
	interfaces have the same ifIndex -> CONTAINER_INSERT fails, but the
	rejected entry was not freed.
      - generate the transport initialization function list dynamically and
	use it
      - moved all functions defined in libnetsnmphelpers to
	libnetsnmpagent. libnetsnmphelpers is now an empty library.
      - moved transport code into a separate subdirectory in snmplib
      - [BUG 3027900]: when cross-compiling it is now assumed that memcmp()
	is available instead of assuming that it is not available.
      - Do no double declare the index values.
      - Handle embedded %'s in the result message.
      - ilence some compilation warnings from test cases.

    Cygwin:
      - IPv6 is only supported under Cygwin 1.7 or later. The old
	implementation of IPv6 support in Net-SNMP under Cygwin involved a
	strange mixture of Cygwin and Winsock2 socket calls, which was too
	hard to maintain.
      - IPv6 is only supported under Cygwin 1.7 or later. The old
	implementation of IPv6 support in Net-SNMP under Cygwin involved a
	strange mixture of Cygwin and Winsock2 socket calls, which was too
	hard to maintain. builds again with IPv6 support enabled
	(--enable-ipv6). At least Net-SNMP 5.5 doesn't build under Cygwin
	with IPv6 support enabled. The configure script reported "checking
	ipv6 stack type ... result: "unknown, no" ... error: IPv6
	transports not available if IPv6 support is not enabled".
      - [BUG 2939168]: byte order of udpLocalPort is now correct.
      - [BUG 2939168]: fixed test infrastructure ("make test"). This has
	been fixed by using the proper environment separator character and
	by adding the path of the netstat executable for Cygwin in
	testing/TESTCONF.sh.
      - abort if the file program could not be found, since this is
	essential for proper operation of libtool. neither compile nor link
	winpipe.c.
      - building with another OpenSSL package than the Cygwin-provided
	packages openssl and openssl-devel is again possible.
      - builds now also when the source files are located on a Samba
	filesystem instead of a local filesystem.
      - enabled Unix transport. (Forward-ported r18687 from the V5.5
	branch).
      - libnetsnmp does now build as a DLL when configured with
	--enable-shared.
      - libnetsnmp does now build as a DLL when configured with
	--enable-shared. perl modules do now build (--with-perl-modules).
	Note: the T060trapdperl_olducd, T061agentperl_olducd and
	T115agentxperl_olducd tests still fail.
      - libnetsnmpmibs, libnetsnmphelpers and libnetsnmpagent do now build
	as a DLL when configured with --enable-shared.
      - perl: building the Perl modules with the Cygwin Perl package is now
	possible. (Forward-ported r18688 from the V5.5 branch.)
      - the message "configure: WARNING: winsock.h: present but cannot be
	compiled" does no longer appear when running the configure script.
	Follow-up for r18050: re-enabled libiphlpapi and iphlpapi.h tests
	for non-MinGW platforms since the Cygwin build needs these.
      - corrected error handling in mibII/at.

    Linux:
      - Improved EtherLike-MIB support Patch supplied by Josef Moellers
      - builds again with embedded Perl disabled (bug 2985915).

    MinGW:
      - building with another OpenSSL package than the Cygwin-provided
	packages openssl and openssl-devel is again possible. building with
	OpenSSL works again.
      - running the regression test suite is again possible ('make test').
      - struct sockaddr_in6.sin6_scope_id configure test does now work.
      - winExtDLL compiles now under MinGW. building Net-SNMP works again.
	Detailed overview: * Changes in the configure script:
      - refuse to run the regression tests if kill.exe cannot be found.
      - run_shell_command() with either input or output (but not both) does
	now work. This did not work until now because on MinGW mkstemp()
	generates a MinGW-style path (/tmp/...) while system() invokes
	cmd.exe and hence expects a Windows-style path (C:\...).
      - testing: skip the tests that require SIGHUP since MinGW does not
	support SIGHUP.
      - tests T059 and T065 do now pass.
      - tests T110, T111, T112, T120, T121 and T122 do now pass when snmpd
	is built with winExtDLL support enabled.

    Solaris:
      - OS header detection check is now run before IPv6 stack detection.
	sockaddr_in6.sin6_addr configure test does now work.
      - Protect against missing package version information crashing the
	agent. Problem reported by Inyaven Sakarai.

    Win32:
      - Fix batch build using recent versions of Visual Studio. Partial
	back port of SVN revisions 17573 and 17696.
      - The header file <sys/timeb.h> is no longer included from
	<net-snmp/types.h>. Or: the header file <sys/timeb.h> will have to
	be included explicitly in source files that need the declaration of
	the function ftime(). Note: compared to r18024 and before, this
	change does not affect BSD systems -- <sys/timeb.h> was only
	included from <net-snmp/types.h> on BSD systems in revisions
	r18025..r18152.
      - added #include <malloc.h> in win32/net-snmp/net-snmp-config.h such
	that the MSVC compiler doesn't get confused by the malloc
	redefinition when building libsnmp as a DLL.
      - added the functions netsnmp_malloc(), netsnmp_calloc(),
	netsnmp_realloc(), netsnmp_strdup() and netsnmp_free(). snmplib:
	removed the troublesome #define malloc netsnmp_malloc etc. This
	means that when calling functions from the Net-SNMP DLL from C or
	C++ code that is being linked against another version of the MSVC
	runtime DLL than the Net-SNMP DLL, and when allocating memory that
	will be freed by the Net-SNMP DLL, you will either have to call the
	Net-SNMP memory allocation functions explicitly or redefine
	malloc() etc. yourself.
      - batch build: replaced the obsolete /GX by the equivalent /EHsc.
      - batch build: replaced the obsolete /GX by the equivalent /EHsc.
	batch build: added /D "_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS" /D
	"_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_WARNINGS" to make building with MSVC 2008 more
	silent.
      - batch build: replaced the obsolete /GX by the equivalent /EHsc.
	batch build: added /D "_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS" /D
	"_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_WARNINGS" to make building with MSVC 2008 more
	silent. batch build: removed /Fp... and /YX. These options
	influence how precompiled header files are generated, which are not
	used inside the Net-SNMP project. /YX is not supported by MSVC
	2008.
      - batch build: replaced the obsolete /GX by the equivalent /EHsc.
	batch build: added /D "_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS" /D
	"_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_WARNINGS" to make building with MSVC 2008 more
	silent. batch build: removed /Fp... and /YX. These options
	influence how precompiled header files are generated, which are not
	used inside the Net-SNMP project. /YX is not supported by MSVC
	2008. batch build: removed a duplicate occurrence of strtoull.obj.
      - building: Added libsnmp.def to the list of libsnmp_dll.dsp source
	files such that the DLL is rebuilt when the .def file has been
	modified.
      - building: building NetSNMP.pm does no longer trigger compiler
	warnings about redefining _WIN32_WINNT nor NTDDI_VERSION.
      - building: converted .dsp/.dsw files to .vcproj/.sln files. This
	implies that support for MSVC 6.0 has been dropped and the minimum
	Microsoft Visual Studio version required to build the Net-SNMP
	source code is Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (2002).
      - building: made building NetSNMP.pm more silent by adding the MSVC
	compiler flags -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
	-D_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_WARNINGS.
      - building: made building more silent by not redefining malloc() or
	free() during compilation of Perl extensions (resulted in warnings
	about malloc() / free() redefinition in the Perl header
	CORE/XSUB.h).
      - building: renamed libsdll.dsw into win32dll.dsw.
      - building: renamed libsdll.dsw into win32dll.dsw. building:
	simplified linking the Net-SNMP applications with netsnmp.dll by
	adding all application projects to the same workspace that is used
	for building the DLL.
      - building: renamed libsdll.dsw into win32dll.dsw. building:
	simplified linking the Net-SNMP applications with netsnmp.dll by
	adding all application projects to the same workspace that is used
	for building the DLL. building: made building netsnmp.dll less
	error prone by letting the compiler print an error message if the
	preprocessor symbol NETSNMP_USE_DLL has not been defined.
      - building: simplified the build process by removing the file
	win32/libsnmp_dll/libsnmp.def.in. Which IPv6 functions are exported
	from netsnmp.dll is now determined by which of the functions in
	this DLL have been declared as NETSNMP_IMPORT.
      - building: simplified the procedure for building with SNMPv3 support
	enabled (OpenSSL).
      - changed the type of the fourth argument of netsnmp_set_row_column()
	from const char* to const void* such that no cast is necessary when
	passing another datatype then char* or const char*. changed
	in_addr_t from u_int to u_long such that it matches the datatype of
	sockaddr_in::sin_addr. Also, fixed several compiler warnings
	(mostly char * <> u_char * mismatches) and removed some casts.
      - declared all functions that are exported from the Net-SNMP DLL as
	NETSNMP_IMPORT. The result is a minor optimization: code that uses
	the Net-SNMP DLL will now call the DLL-exported functions directly
	instead of indirectly via the stub in the import library.
      - exported netsnmp_read_module() from netsnmp.dll such that
	NetSNMP.pm builds again.
      - exported netsnmp_set_line_buffering() from netsnmp.dll.
      - libsnmp builds again as a DLL when IPv6 is enabled.
      - perl: fixed several "Free to wrong pool" errors. Note: since
	calloc() is not redefined in <CORE/XSUB.h> using calloc() directly
	or indirectly leads to "Free to wrong pool" errors, at least on
	Windows.
      - winExtDLL: don't trigger a netsnmp_assert() when no extension DLLs
	have been loaded.
      - winExtDLL: fixed a bug in getNext handling that could cause the MIB
	output to be truncated.
      - winExtDLL: multiple varbind set requests are now processed
	correctly.
      - winExtDLL: multiple varbind set requests are now processed
	correctly. winExtDLL: made error codes in SNMP response PDUs as
	RFC-compliant as possible.
      - winExtDLL: multiple varbind set requests are now processed
	correctly. winExtDLL: made error codes in SNMP response PDUs as
	RFC-compliant as possible. winExtDLL: if loading an extension DLL
	fails, the reason why loading failed is now logged.
      - winExtDLL: multiple varbind set requests are now processed
	correctly. winExtDLL: made error codes in SNMP response PDUs as
	RFC-compliant as possible. winExtDLL: if loading an extension DLL
	fails, the reason why loading failed is now logged. winExtDLL:
	fixed a memory leak that occurred when SnmpExtensionQuery(Ex)
	failed. This memory leak has been found via source reading. Note:
	it is not clear whether it was possible to trigger this memory
	leak. This leak is certainly not triggered by every request for
	which a response with non-zero error status is sent back.
      - Suppressed "implicit cast from int to u_char" warnings generated by
	MSVC.
      - made sure that accessing the mibII interfaces table does not
	trigger out-of-range array accesses (was detected by
	BoundsChecker).
      - Fix build under MinGW back/forward port of revision 18631
