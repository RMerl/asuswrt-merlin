        and http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Configuration
      - Include statements can now be used in .conf files.
        See http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Configuration

    snmpd:
      - Fix handling of multiple matching VACM entries. (Use the "best"
	match, rather than the first one). Reported by Adam Lewis. Note
	that this could potentially affect the behaviour of existing access
	control configurations.

      - moved all functions defined in libnetsnmphelpers to
	libnetsnmpagent. libnetsnmphelpers is now an empty library.
      - Implemented the TSM-MIB and the TLSTM-MIB
      - new API for indicating that persistent store needs to be saved
	after the current request finishes processing
      - [PATCH 2931446]: make the load averages writable.

      - Transports can now specify session defaults
        - E.G. dtlsudp: auto-sets the SNMP version and the security model.
      - [PATCH 2942940]: Add a new function, netsnmp_parse_args, that is
	like snmp_parse_args but takes an additional bitmask, flags, to
	affect the behaviour. Also remove the magic handling of some
	application names.
      - A new X.509 certificate API for indexing and reading certificates
      - new experimental row creation API which uses a state machine
        to try really hard to create a row from a given varbind list
      - netsnmp_container enhancements:
        - added a free_item function
        - added a CONTAINER_FREE_ALL macro/function
        - added an interface for duplicating a container (CONTAINER_DUP)
        - added a remove function to container_iterators
	- added an ability to set options on binary_array containers
      - new snmp token logOption allows specifying log destinations
        via configuration conf files

      - [BUG 2939168]: byte order of udpLocalPort is now correct.
      - [BUG 2939168]: fixed test infrastructure ("make test"). This has
	been fixed by using the proper environment separator character and
	by adding the path of the netstat executable for Cygwin in
	testing/TESTCONF.sh.
      - building with another OpenSSL package than the Cygwin-provided
	packages openssl and openssl-devel is again possible.
      - running the regression test suite is again possible ('make test').

*5.4*

  Important Changes:
    - The default configuration now enables embedded Perl and the Perl
      modules by default when possible unless explicitly disabled. You
      may use the --disable-embedded-perl and --without-perl-modules
      configure options, respectively, to revert to the former default
      configuration.

  New:
    python:
      - Python bindings to the Net-SNMP project are now available in
        the python sub-directory.  See the README file there for details. 

    build:
      - Some preliminary support for automatic building of dynamically
        loadable mib module code.
      - Most net-snmp specific defines are now (also) available under
        a proper NETSNMP_ prefix. The older, potentially conflicting
        names as well as the autoconf variables can now be turned off
        easily within 3rd party code.
      - libtool update to 1.5.22
      - enable-as-needed will try to link built libraries against needed
	libraries at library link time, rather than application link time.
        This is preliminary support for what will likely be better in 5.5.

    snmplib:
      - [PATCH 1282566]: to rework transport creation to allow for
        alternative interpretations of the address and a more flexible
        transport registration system
      - [PATCH 1509943]: responses will get sent from the original dest IP
        address when possible.

    snmpd:
      - new MIB table for managing Net-SNMP access control extensions
        (see NET-SNMP-VACM-MIB).  These extensions to the VACM MIB are
        Net-SNMP specific and are used primarily by snmptrapd at this point.
      - [PATCH 1550725]: A new uint instance helper to match the existing
        int, long and ulong helpers
      - [PATCH 1534877]: to add support for skipping NFS entries in the
        host resources hrStorageTable.	See the skipNFSInHostResources
        token in the snmpd.conf file for details.
      - A "hardware abstraction layer", to localise the O/S-specific
        aspects of retrieving system data.  This first appeared in the
        5.3.x line, but this release now starts to actively use it for
        implementing particular MIB modules.
        This has resulted in some minor changes in behaviour - some index
        values in the hrStorageTable have changed from earlier releases,
        and the (non-raw) memory statistics are now consistent, reporting
        percentage usage calculated over the last minute on _all_ systems.
      - Agent builds default module list from a default_mibs.h rather than
        a hard coded configure list
      - [PATCH 1568150]: Extend pass_persist error messages that can be
	passed back from the script
      - [PATCH 1570982]: Solaris IF-MIB: Support for IPv6-only interfaces

    snmptrapd:
      - the traphandle directive now supports a -t switch to indicate
        matching any OID in the tree below the specified OID

    mib2c:
      - New mib2c.emulation.conf provides a quick way to do simplistic
        emulation of an entire MIB or MIB branch.
      - A new perl module NetSNMP::agent::Support provides easier embedded 
        perl support. (patch 1369996 from Peter Martin)
        Run "mib2c -c mib2c.perl.conf OID" to help you start using it.

    perl:
      - gettable() now supports asynchronous callback functions
      - update default_store module to latest default_store c-binding
	tokens

    snmpusm:
      - performance improvement when changing localized keys
      - new option -Cp to set usmUserPublic value

      - new commands to manipulate Net-SNMP access control extensions

 Ports:
   Linux:
      - add IPv6 aware UDP and TCP mibs to default module list

   Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD:
      - Experimental support for 64bit interface counters (ifXTable). Enable
        via '--with-mib-modules=if-mib --enable-mfd-rewrites'.
      - [PATCH 1569537,1569539]: new UDP-MIB and TCP-MIB implementation
	(enable through --with-mib-modules=udp-mib,tcp-mib)

   Win32:
      - new winExtDLL extension module to allow snmpd to load Windows SNMP
        Service extension DLLs to provide support for HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
        and other MIBs provided with Windows.

   AIX:
      - HOST-RESOURCES-MIB implementation added to default module list

   uCLinux
      - [PATCH 1551948]: Make pass_persist usable on uClinux

  Fixes:
    snmplib:
      - fix OID lookups for fully qualified object names (eg .iso.org)
        (official patch 1421725)

        (official patch 1420758)
      - fix re-init of daemons after SIGHUP (official patch 1473289)

    perl:
      - Fixed the perl bulkwalk function
      - gettable() was fairly broken in prior versions 
      - OID handling was fully broken on various 64bit platforms
      - fixes for 64-bit platforms

    misc:
      - Many misc fixes

*5.3.0.1*

  *** Security Fix ***

    - In version 5.3 much of the authorization control was rewritten.
      There was a bug in the new code that resulted in granting write
      access to read-only users or communities which were configured
      using the "rocommunity" or "rouser" snmpd.conf tokens.  5.3.0.1
      fixes this problem.  Users are encouraged to immediately update
      their installations if they use either of these tokens.


*5.3*

 *** Important Notes ***

    Several very significant changes have been made in Net-SNMP for this
    release that warrant special attention.

    - shared library version number no longer matches the release number. We
      now follow the versioning scheme recommended by libtool. For the 5.3
      release this means that the libraries now have a SONAME ending with
      ".so.10", e.g. libnetsnmp.so.10.

    - snmpd has not been truncating log files at startup, as documented in
      the man pages, for a while now. This default behaviour has been restored.
      Please use the '-A' flag if you want to continue appending to your log
      files at startup.

    - snmptrapd will no longer accept all traps by default. It must be
      configured with authorized SNMPv1/v2c community strings and/or SNMPv3
      users. Non-authorized traps/informs will be dropped.

    - Due to a copyright statement that didn't allow modifications, 
      snmpnetstat has been completely rewritten.  The new version now
      accepts the same command-line options as the other tools, which
      has introduced a number of incompatible changes.  However, it
      does now finally support SNMPv3.

 New:
    Building:
      - new option to disable set support in the agent (--disable-set-support)

   snmpd:
     - implement notification logging
     - implement notification filtering
     - AgentX, host resources and disman/event mibs added to default module list
     - updated and new disman mib implementations

   snmptrapd:
     - allow a non-default AgentX socket
     - a brand new authorization scheme that is based on the VACM
       authorization scheme from snmpd.
       - Note: now drops unauthenticated notifications by default
     - registers the snmpEngine MIB group under the "snmptrapd" context

   snmplib:
     - new helper for ascii file based scalar integers (think Linux /proc/)
     - new utilities for dealing with files
     - new utilities for parsing text files
     - granular config/persistent file disablement (noPersistentLoad and
       noPersistentSave snmp.conf tokens)

    mib2c:
      - mib2c.mfd.conf now generates code for persistence row storage
      - many enhancements and bug fixes

    snmpusm:
      - allows to use old and/or new localized key instead of passphrase with
        option -Ck
      - new option -CE to specify usmUserEngineID (necessary to manage
        snmptrapd's usmUserTable)

 Ports:
   Linux:
       - new experimental tables
         - tcpConnectionTable, tcpListenerTable
         - ipAddressPrefixTable
         - udpEndpointTable
         - ipv4InterfaceTable, ipv6InterfaceTable
       - inetCidrRouteTable supports dynamic ipv4 route creation/deletion
       - added ipv6IpForwarding.0 and ipv6IpDefaultHopLimit.0 (read-write)

   Win32:
     - Cygwin compiler fixes
     - MSVC: agent (snmpd) support for pass and pass_persist
     - MinGW: agent (snmpd) support for pass
     - Fix for 'select: No such file or directory' in snmpdelta

 Fixes:
   - Persistent files in directory defined by snmp.conf persistentDir were 
     not being loaded at startup
   - Perl getnext didn't honor explicit reference to MIB file
   - AgentX sub-agent connection delayed til after config files read
   - Build fixes for --disable-agent, --disable-snmpv1 and --disable-snmpv2c
   - Lots of bug fixes


*5.2*
 New:
    For the security paranoid (like Wes):
      - Insecure versions of SNMP may be completely disabled at compile time.
          (configure using one or both of --disable-snmpv1 --disable-snmpv2c)
      - Less secure versions of SNMPv3 authentication and encryption
          algorithms may be completely disabled at compile time.
          (configure using one or both of --disable-des --disable-md5)
          (This requires you have OpenSSL to support SHA1 and AES instead)
      - Diffie-Helman key negotiation (perfect-forward-secrecy - RFC2786)
          has been implemented in both the agent and "snmpusm".
      - Better support for direct use of localized and master keys
        (randomly generated keys have more entropy than passwords). See
        the -3m -3M -3k and -3K options, and the defAuthLocalizedKey,
        defPrivLocalizedKey, defAuthMasterKey, defPrivMasterKey
        snmp.conf tokens)

    library:
      - send and receive buffer sizes for UDP/TCP are configurable
      - .conf file token registration can now search multiple files
        (separate file names to search by a :.  IE, "snmpd:agentx")

    snmptrapd:
      - Embedded perl support for trap handlers (much faster than traphandles).
          (configure --with-embedded-perl ; see 'perldoc NetSNMP::TrapReceiver')
      - the snmptrapd usmUser table can be controlled through SNMP & AgentX
          (the snmptrapd registers MIBs under the "snmptrapd" SNMPv3 context)

    agent:
      - community strings can be mapped to individual SNMPv3 contexts
          (see the snmpd.conf manual on "com2sec").
      - AgentX should work properly with SNMPv3 contexts now.
      - improved version of "exec" extension directive - "extend":
          supports multi-line output, configurable command input, SET
          handling, a valid relocatable MIB output structure, etc
      - more flexibility added to netsnmp_cache helper, including periodic
          refreshing of caches and cache pre-loading.
      - experimental implementation of DisMan Remote Operations MIB groups
        (remote nslookup, ping, traceroute and expressions via SNMP)
      - The proxy supports a new -Cc flag which passes the community
        name through to the other side rather than hard-coding it.
      - The config_require() and other modules can now be placed
        inside of CPP directievs (#if, /* ... */) as header files are
        now passed through CPP processing first.
      - new config_exclude() macro for excluding certain modules
      - new config_belongs_in() macro to specify if a chunk of code
        found by --with-mib-modules belongs in the agent library or
        the mib module library.
      - Uses a smaller function stack.

    commands:
      - snmpusm: A number of key-change improvements
        (EG, changing localized keys supported, diffie-helman support, ...)
      - New -Ln option to completely disable logging.

    mib2c:
      - a number of new or updated configuration templates:
        - mib2c.iterate.conf: the iterator-based table config
            now produces fuller template code than before.
        - mib2c.table_data.conf and mib2c.container.conf:
            two new "internal-row" style configs
        - mib2c.mfd.conf: "MIBs for Dummies" (or MFD) - intended to
            reduce the SNMP knowledge needed to develop MIB modules
            and add flexibility at the same time.  Run "mib2c -S
            mfd_interactive_setup=1 -c mib2c.mfd.conf OID" and follow
            its guided instructions to help you tailor its results to
            meet your needs.
        - mib2c.genhtml.conf: Generates an easier-to-read HTML view of
          a MIB tree structure.  (See http://www.Net-SNMP.org/mibs/
          for example output.)
      - more node tags available for conf file writers
      - additional search directories may be set via MIB2C_DIRS env var.
      - mib2c-update: new utility to help update mib2c generated code
          when conf file changes.
      - a mib2c.conf manual page to describe how to write mib2c .conf files.
      - support for embedded perl code in mib2c.conf files

      - New README.agent-mibs: an attempt to start documenting what
          MIBs are implemented in the agent and on what architectures.

    perl:
      - An improved SNMP::gettable() method.  Uses GETBULK if possible and
        better GETNEXT requests if not, decodes indexes from OIDs,
        requests multiple variables at once, ...  ("perldoc SNMP" for details)
      - A NetSNMP::OID::get_indexes() function to extract index values
        from an OID.

 Ports:
   Linux:
     - new experimental tables/rewrites for Linux, including:
           ifTable, ifXTable, inetCidrRouteTable, ipCidrRouteTable,

       - Enable these talbles by specifying --enable-mfd-rewrites to configure.
       - Most of these tables have IPv6 support as well.

        speed of the agent's processing time.
      - for mib code using the table iterator, an auto-caching mechanism
        which can greatly speed up access at the cost of caching.
        (see "stash_cache" in the injectHandler token docs in snmpd.conf(5))
      - Some of the agent modules were completely rewritten (and
        should be faster and cleaner).

   was delayed and further changes and fixes were made.  However, the 
   release candidate files still appeared on the public FTP server and our
   mirrors. To avoid the confusion that could occur to users who may have
   downloaded this release candidate, we are bumping the revision number

    - misc other bug fixes.

*5.0*

 New:

    - Much of the agent internals were completely rewritten and sports
      a new module API to make your life easier.  See the
      agent/mibgroup/examples directory for example code that makes
      use of some of the new functionality.
      (Also see http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/agent/ which has
      some incomplete documentation)
    - The agent sports embedded perl, see the perl details further below.
    - The agent supports multiple SNMPv3 contexts and mib modules can
      now register themselves under different contexts.  (see the -n
      option in the snmpcmd manual page for details on specifying
      context strings in requests)
    - The proxy code has been completely rewritten and now supports
      the use of SNMPv3 contexts to help select which proxied host you
      wish to talk to.  See the snmpd.conf manual page.
    - All the tools take --configToken=value options now.  (see -H
      output from any command for what configTokens it accepts)
    - All the tools can speak over many different transport layers
      now, including UDP/TCP (ipv4 and ipv6), AAL5pvc, and IPX.  See
      ./configure --help for details on enabling them.
      Note: the -p and -T flags to all the applications have been
      removed.  Use hostname strings like "tcp:localhost:9999"
      instead.  See the snmpcmd manual page for details.
    - snmptrapd now acts as an agentx subagent and implements portions
      of the NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB to allow captured traps and informs
      to be queried.
    - A "net-snmp-config" script will get installed which can report
      how the various tools were built (which libraries they were
      linked against, etc).  It will also help you do other things as
      well, like setting up snmpv3.  Run net-snmp-config --help for details.
    - kerberos authenticated and encrypted SNMPv3 is now possible.
      See ./configure --help for details on enabling the ksm security module.
    - The AgentX subagent protocol implementation has many new
      features and fixes.
    - mib2c was completely rewritten and has a much improved
      configuration file specification.
    - Much of the code is getting documented with "doxygen" style
      documentation.  Run "make docs" if you have doxygen installed.
    - some RMON support is available.
      (See agent/mibgroup/Rmon/README for details.)
    - The source tree has been reorganized and all the exported header
      files are now in the include subdirectory.  You can now point to
      the includes easily without having to run "make install" first.
    - the agent now requires a configuration file to access any information.
    - The entire code base has had indent run on it to effect a
      consistent coding style.  See the CodingStyle file for details.

 Perl:
    
    - The SNMP perl module now calls init_snmp() like real net-snmp
      applications, which means it will read snmp.conf configuration
      files, etc.
    - new perl specific configure options --with-perl-modules &
      --enable-embedded-perl.  See ./configure --help for details.
    - The beginnings of some new Perl modules (alpha level quality)
      are in the perl directory, including:
      - NetSNMP::agent which allows perl scripts to become net-snmp
        master or subagents
      - AnyData::SNMP is available that implements a perl DBI
        interface to map SQL commands to SNMP.  Included is a "netsh"
        shell where SQL commands can be typed, aliases created, etc.
        See the perl/AnyData_SNMP/INSTALL file for details.
    - Beginning (alpha level quality) support for embedding perl
      subroutines directly within the net-snmp agent.

      (see snmptrapd.conf(5))
    - More configuration files have been created and can be used to
      specify defaults and configuration information to the various
      applications.  Run each command with -H to see what it understands.
      (see snmp_config(5), snmpd.conf(5), snmp.conf(5), snmptrapd.conf(5))
    - The configuration file parser looks in ~/.snmp by default as
      well, allowing each user to have his/her own setup files for the
      various applications.
    - The mib parser supports a variety of options dictating how
      strictly it parses mib files.
      (see snmpcmd.1 on "-P")

 Copyright:
    - Simplification.

*3.5*

 New:
    - agent/mibgroup directory reorganized hierarchically.
      - this may break the agent compilation with some compilers.

      exists.  See the snmpd.conf file for how to control access via
      community names now.
    - The header file #defines have changed.  You may have to compile
      third party applications with -DCMU_COMPATIBLE (like perl-SNMP <= V1.7).
    - The parser is more strict about unlinked OIDs and end-of-comment
      conditions.  You may see problems in a few broken mibs that used
      to parse ok with the older parser.

 New:
    - dynamic library support:  configure with --enable-shared.
    - the beginnings of a Perl/Tk/SNMP mib browser: tkmib

    - snmptrap sends to the correct default port of 162 again.

 Ports:
    - irix 6.2 support improved.
    - openbsd.
    - the host resources mib compiles on Solaris.

*3.3.1*

 New:
    - "make install" installs the library and header files.

 Fixes:
    - compilation on many architectures (sunos for example).
    - snmptrapd doesn't exit if v2party files don't exist.
    - host resources works a bit better (ie, it compiles) under solaris.
    

*3.3*

  Path changes:
    - the default paths to the installed mibs and snmpd.conf file have
      changed to /usr/local/share/snmp (set differently using --datadir).
    - the default path of the snmpd and snmptrapd have changed to
      /usr/local/sbin (set differently using --sbindir).

  New:
    - basic SNMPV2c support.  
      - Not fully tested (feedback please!), and not RFC compliant.
      - all apps require '-v 2c' for v2c and '-v 2p' for the older party code.

    - snmptrapd is snmp-version multi-lingual.

  Ported:
    - irix should be more complete.
    - aix 4.1.5.
    - fixes for hpux 10.20.
    - linux 2.1.x support.
    - library and apps supported under 32bit windows systems.

  Fixes:
    - too numerous to mention.

*3.2*

  New:
    - Top level of the mib parser has been restructured
      - no longer reads 'mib.txt'
      - no longer reads everything (MIBS/MIBDIRS)
      - reads import clauses to load other required modules
      - new man page: mib_api.3
    - The agent has been completely restructured (modularized) to
      allow for easier extension via C code and requires no
      modification of the ucd-snmp distributed source code to add in
      new C coded mib modules.  See the README file in the
      agent/mibgroup subdirectory for details.  Modules are added and/or
      removed via configure options.
    - agent can send traps to multiple trap destinations.
