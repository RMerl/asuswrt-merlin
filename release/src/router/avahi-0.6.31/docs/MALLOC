Avahi supports pluggable memory allocator implemenations. See
<avahi-common/malloc.h> for more information.

Currently, Avahi does not deal well with out-of-memory
situations. Therefore we recommend the usage of memory allocators that
abort() in case of OOM. The default allocator used by Avahi does this.

Eventually we will improve Avahi to deal with these things better.
