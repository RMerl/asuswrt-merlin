-->
<!-- 
================================== assignment ==================================
AssignedBy
==========
An identifier for the party assigning a piece of metadata. This can be a
string that designates the party informally (for example, a person's name),
or a pointer in the form a fragment identifier consisting of a # character
followed by the Duid of a Topic corresponding to the party.

Importance
==========
An indication of the importance the party assigning a piece of metadata
attaches to it. The value of the Importance attribute is a formal name for a
level of importance. Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a
controlled vocabulary.

Confidence
==========
An indication of the confidence with which a piece of metadata has been
assigned. The value of the Confidence attribute is a formal name for a
degree of confidence. Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a
controlled vocabulary.

HowPresent
==========
An indication of the way in which a piece of metadata applies. The value of
the HowPresent attribute is a formal name for the way the metadata applies.
Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a controlled vocabulary.

DateAndTime
===========
The date and (optionally) time at which a piece of metadata was assigned. 

Uses the format CCYYMMDDTHHMMSS{+or-}HHMM (century, year, month, day, time
separator, hours, minutes, seconds, timezone separator, hours, minutes). If
only the Date is needed, then the substring from T onwards may be omitted.

This is the Basic Format defined by ISO 8601. CCYY is a 4-digit year number.
MM is a 2-digit month number. DD is a 2-digit day number. T is the letter 'T'.
HH is a 2-digit hour number (using a 24-hour clock). MM is a 2 digit minute
number. (Note that midnight may be represented as 2400 or 240000 on the date
of the day that is ending, or as 0000 or 000000 on the date of the day that is
beginning.)

{+or-} is the '+' character or the '-' character, and the following HHMM are
hours and minutes of offset from Universal Co-ordinated Time (UTC) as defined
by ISO 8601. If the time is being expressed in UTC, then the timezone offset
may be '+0000' or '-0000'. If the time is behind UTC, the timezone separator
is '-'. If the time is ahead of UTC the timezone separator is '+'.

Example: 10:27 p.m. in New York on 31 December 2000 would be expressed as 
"20001231T222700-0500" as New York is five hours behind UTC in winter.
At the same moment in London, the date and time would be expressed as 
time would be expressed as "20010101T032700+0000" or as , "20010101T00+0000", as
in London, it is now 3:27 a.m.  on 1 January 2001. At the same moment in Paris,
the date and time would be expressed as "20010101T042700+0100", as Paris is one
hour ahead of UTC in winter, and it is now 4:27 a.m. on 1 January 2001.

<!-- 
================================= formalname ===================================

FormalName
==========
A string of characters whose meaning is determined by a controlled vocabulary.

Vocabulary
==========
The Vocabulary attribute, if present, provides a pointer to a TopicSet which is
the controlled vocabulary that can be used to resolve the meaning of the
FormalName. The value of the Vocabulary attribute is an http URL or a NewsML
URN, or the # character followed by the value of the Duid attribute of the a
TopicSet in the current document.

If there is no Vocabulary attribute, then the controlled vocabulary to be used
is located by the following algorithm:
- Proceed to the parent of the current element.
- If it has a Catalog element as its immediate child, see whether that Catalog
  contains a Resource element whose DefaultVocabularyFor child contains an XPath
  pattern that is matched by the current element. If so, then the controlled
  vocabulary is the resource identified by that Resource element.
- If the parent does not meet the above condition, proceed to its parent and
  check the same condition.
- Continue until a vocabulary is found, or no further parent elements are
  available because the root element has been reached and it too fails to meet
  the condition.

If there is no Vocabulary attribute and the above algorithm fails to identify
a resource that serves as the controlled vocabulary, there is an error, which
the NewsML system may signal to the user.

The NewsML system may also signal an error if a vocabulary is successfully
identified, but it contains no item that matches the value of the FormalName
whose meaning is sought.

Scheme
======
The Scheme attribute, if present, serves to distinguish which of possibly
multiple naming schemes in the controlled vocabulary is the one that governs
this FormalName. For a match to be obtained within the controlled vocabulary,
the rule is that the FormalName and the Scheme must both match. If there is
no Scheme attribute on the current element, the match will be to an item in
the vocabulary that has the current formal name and no scheme. If there is a
Scheme attribute on the current element, then both the formal name and the
scheme in the controlled vocabulary must match.

<!-- 
=================================== localid ====================================

Duid
====
Duid is a "Document-unique Identifier". It must satisfy the rules for XML ID
attributes: it must only contain name characters, and it must start with a 
name-start character (not a digit). Its value must be unique within any NewsML
document.

Every NewsML element type has Duid as an optional attribute. Combined with the
Identifier element, providing a value for the Duid of any element in a NewsML
document makes the element globally identifiable. The Identifier element gives
global identification to the document, and the Duid provides local
identification for the element within the document.

Euid
====
Euid is an "Element-unique Identifier". Its value must be unique among elements
of the same element-type and having the same parent element.

Use of Euid attribute makes it possible to identify any NewsML element within
the context of its local branch of the NewsML document tree. This makes it
possible to copy, or include by reference, subtrees into new combinations in
ways that would break the uniqueness of Duids (thereby forcing new Duids to be
allocated), but still being able to retain the identity of each element. If
Euids are maintained at every level, it is possible to identify, for example
"The ContentItem whose Euid is abc within the NewsComponent whose Euid is def".
Such identification patterns would be preserved even after "pruning and
grafting" of subtrees.

============================ DefaultVocabularyFor ==============================
An indication that the parent Resource provides the default vocabulary that
determines the meanings and permitted values of the data occurring in a
particular part of a NewsML document subtree. The Context attribute is an
XPath statement identifying the data to which the default vocabulary applies.
The optional Scheme attribute identifies the relevant naming scheme if the
Resource contains more than one naming scheme. If the Resource is a NewsML
TopicSet, then the meaning of the data identified by the Context is provided
by the Topic whose FormalName subelement matches that data. If the Resource is
not a NewsML TopicSet, then the way in which it is interpreted in order to
provide a meaning for the data is not defined by NewsML but by the authority
that governs whatever format the Resource uses.

<!-- 
================================== ProviderId ==================================
An identifier for the news provider that produced the NewsItem. The

domain name that is owned by the provider at the date identified by the DateId
subelement of the NewsIdentifier, or the name for the Provider drawn from a
controlled vocabulary identified by a URN specified in the Vocabulary attribute.
This will ensure that the identity of the provider can be inferred unambiguously
from the full NewsIdentifier.

 <DateId>20001001</DateId>
 <NewsItemId>NewsML version 1.0</NewsItemId>

If the ProviderId is name drawn from a controlled vocabulary

urn:newsml:|{ProviderId@Vocabulary}|{ProviderId}|:{DateId}:{NewsItemId}:{RevisionId}{RevisionId@Update}

where {x} means "the content of the x subelement of the NewsIdentifier" and
{x@y} means "the value of the y attribute of the x subelement of the
NewsIdentifier", with the exception that if the Update attribute of the
RevisionId element has its default value of N, it is omitted from the URN, and
that the Vocabulary attribute of the ProviderId element is stripped of the
substring "urn:" with which it begins. The Vocabulary attribute of ProviderId
necessarily begins with the characters "urn:" because, as stated in the
comment to the ProviderId element above, it must take the form of a URN
identifying a controlled vocabulary.

Note that the existence of this URN enables the NewsItem to be referenced
unambiguously by pointers from other XML elements or resources. Within such
pointers, if  the RevisionId, its preceding : character and its following Update

or a NewsML URN as described in the comment to PublicIdentifier, or a fragment
identifier consisting of a # character followed by the Duid of a TopicSet in the
current document. The presence of a TopicSetRef child in a TopicSet has the
effect that all the Topics in the referenced TopicSet are included by reference
within the current TopicSet. When this merging results in there exising two
FormalName grandchildren of the same TopicSet that have the same content and
the same Scheme attribute value, then the Topics whose children are in fact the
same topic, and are deemed to be merged. The merging of Topics need not be
performed physically by the system, but the meaning of the data is
exactly the same as if the merging were actually performed. Merging two
Topcis consists of creating a single Topic that contains all the children of
both, and eliminating duplicates.

value of the Duid of a Topic in the current document. The value of the Context
attribute is an XPath pattern indicating the context where the referenced topic
is used within the subtree to which the current Catalog applies. If the Context
attribute is not present, the TopicUse element simply states that this topic is
present somewhere in the subtree.

An identifier for the NewsML document transmission. This should be unique among
all distinct transmissions from the same publisher. If a transmission is
repeated (perhaps because the sender is not confident that it was successfully
received) then the same TransmissionId content may be used, but a Repeat
attribute should be provided to distinguish the second transmission from the
first. The form that the value of the Repeat attribute takes is determined by
the provider. Likewise, the format for the TransmissionId itself is for the
provider to decide. It could for example consist of a channel identifier
followed by a sequence number.
