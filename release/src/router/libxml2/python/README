		Module libxml2-python
		=====================

This is the libxml2 python module, providing access to the
libxml2 and libxslt (if available) libraries. For general
informationss on those XML and XSLT libraries check their 
web pages at :
    http://xmlsoft.org/
    and
    http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/

The latest version of the sources for this module and the
associated libraries can be found at:
    ftp://xmlsoft.org/

Binaries packages of the libxml2 and libxslt libraries can
be found either on the FTP site for Linux, from external
sources linked from the web pages, or as part of your set of
packages provided with your operating system.

NOTE:
this module distribution is not the primary distribution
of the libxml2 and libxslt Python binding code, but as 
the Python way of packaging those for non-Linux systems.
The main sources are the libxml2 and libxslt tar.gz found on
the site. One side effect is that the official RPM packages for
those modules are not generated from the libxml2-python
distributions but as part of the normal RPM packaging of
those two libraries.
The RPM packages can be found at:
    http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libxml2-python
    http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libxslt-python
