  another anti-hot-linking module

.. meta::
  :keywords: lighttpd, hot-linking, deep-linking

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Description
===========

Anti Hotlinking:

 * if user requests ''download-url'' directly, the request is denied and he is redirected to ''deny-url'
 * if user visits ''trigger-url'' before requesting ''download-url'', access is granted
 * if user visits ''download-url'' again after ''trigger-timeout'' has elapsed, the request is denied and he is redirected to ''deny-url''

The trigger information is either stored locally in a gdbm file or remotely in memcached.

Requirements
------------

 * libpcre
 * libgdbm or libmemcache

Options
=======

::

  trigger-before-download.gdbm-filename = "/home/weigon/testbase/trigger.db"
  trigger-before-download.memcache-hosts = ( "127.0.0.1:11211" )
  trigger-before-download.trigger-url = "^/trigger/"
  trigger-before-download.download-url = "^/download/"
  trigger-before-download.deny-url = "http://192.168.1.5:1025/index.html"
  trigger-before-download.trigger-timeout = 10

If both trigger-before-download.gdbm-filename and
trigger-before-download.memcache-hosts is set gdbm will take precedence.

Installation
============

memcached should be started with the option -M as we don't want to remove entry if the memory is full.
