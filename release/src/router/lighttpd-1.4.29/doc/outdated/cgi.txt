Description
===========

CGI programs allow you to enhance the functionality of the server in a very
straight and simple way..

Options
=======

cgi.assign

  file-extensions that are handled by a CGI program

  e.g.: ::

    cgi.assign = ( ".pl"  => "/usr/bin/perl",
                   ".cgi" => "/usr/bin/perl" )

Examples
========

To setup a executable which doesn't need the help of a external program you
just don't specify a handler for the extension. ::

  cgi.assign = ( ".sh" => "" )

If the file has no extension keep in mind that lighttpd matches not the
extension itself but the right part of the URL: ::

  cgi.assign = ( "/testfile" => "" )
