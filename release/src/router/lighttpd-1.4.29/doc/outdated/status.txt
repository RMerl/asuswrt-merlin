Description
===========

The server status module generates the status overview of the webserver. The
information covers:

- uptime
- average throughput
- current throughput
- active connections and their state


We need to load the module first. ::

  server.modules = ( ..., "mod_ssi", ... )

By default the status page is disabled to hide internal information from
unauthorized users. ::

  status.status-url = "/server-status"

If you want to open the status page just for users from the local network
cover it in a conditional. ::

  $HTTP["remoteip"] == "10.0.0.0/8" {
    status.status-url = "/server-status"
  }

Or require authorization: ::

  auth.require = ( "/server-status" =>
    ( "realm" ... ) )


Please note that when using the server.max-worker directive, the stati of the
childs are not combined yet, so you're going to see different stats with each
request.


Output Format
-------------

By default a nice looking HTML page is generated. If you append ?auto to the
status-url you can get a text version which is simpler to parse. ::

  Total Accesses: 1234
  Total kBytes: 1043
  Uptime: 1234
  BusyServers: 123

Total Accesses is the number of handled requests, kBytes the overall outgoing
traffic, Uptime the uptime in seconds and BusyServers the number of currently
active connections.

The naming is kept compatible to Apache even if we have another concept and
don't start new servers for each connection.
