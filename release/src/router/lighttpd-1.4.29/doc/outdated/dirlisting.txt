Description
===========

mod_dirlisting is one of the modules which is loaded by default and don't have to
be specified on server.modules to work.

A directory listing is generated if a directory is requested and no index-file
was found in that directory.

To enable directory listings globally: ::

  dir-listing.activate = "enable"

If you need it only for a directory, use conditionals: ::

  $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/download($|/)" {
    dir-listing.activate = "enable"
  }

You can also use a external generator for directory listings if you use
mod_indexfile. ::

  index-file.names = ( "/dir-generator.php" )

If a directory is requested the dir-generator.php is called instead which can
take the REQUEST_URI to see which directory was requested.

For large folders this is highly recommend.

Options
=======

dir-listing.activate
  enables virtual directory listings if a directory is requested no
  index-file was found

  Default: disabled

dir-listing.hide-dotfiles
  if enabled, does not list hidden files in directory listings generated
  by the dir-listing option.

dir-listing.exclude
  list of regular expressions.  Files that match any of the specified regular
  expressions will be excluded from directory listings.

dir-listing.encoding
  set a encoding for the generated directory listing

  If you file-system is not using ASCII you have to set the encoding of
  the filenames as they are put into the HTML listing AS IS (with XML
  encoding)

    dir-listing.encoding = "utf-8"
