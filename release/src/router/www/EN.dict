hwnat_desc=NAT (Network Address Translation) is a process used in routers to replace the address information of network packet with new address information. Typical applications for NAT is router which connect to LAN with the WAN. In LAN every network devices had a private IP(LAN IP) but there is only one public IP(WAN IP). To grant the network devices access to the Internet, the router replaces the private IP address of the sender with its own public IP address in all outgoing data packets. The router saves all necessary information in a table(NAT table) so that incoming data packets can then be assigned on the correct network device.

Port trigger only opens the incoming port when a LAN device requests access to the trigger port. Unlike port forwarding, port trigger does not require static IP addresses for LAN devices. Port forwarding allows multiple devices to share a single open port and port trigger only allows one client at a time to access the open port.

The higher priority upstream packet will cause the higher priority downstream packet.</li><li>If there are no packets being sent from high-priority applications, the full transmission rate of the Internet connection is available for low-priority packets.</li></ul>

The Transferred column refers to the upstream and downstream traffic (outgoing and incoming network traffic) for one session. If you do not want to set the traffic limit, you can leave it blank.
