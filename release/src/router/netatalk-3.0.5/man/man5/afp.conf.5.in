.SH "NAME"
afp.conf \- Netatalk configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
The
afp\&.conf
file is the configuration file for the
\fBNetatalk\fR
AFP file server\&.
.PP
All AFP specific configuration and AFP volume definitions are done via this file\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of sections and parameters\&. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\&. Sections contain parameters of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    \fIname\fR = \fIvalue \fR
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The file is line\-based \- that is, each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter\&.
.PP
Section and parameter names are case sensitive\&.
.PP
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant\&. Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded\&. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant\&. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded\&. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim\&.
.PP
Any line beginning with a semicolon (\(lq;\(rq) or a hash (\(lq#\(rq) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace\&.
.PP
Any line ending in a
\(lq \e \(rq
is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion\&.
.PP
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 1/0 or true/false\&. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values\&. Some items such as create masks are numeric\&.
.PP
The parameter
\fBinclude = \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
allows you to include one config file inside another\&. The file is included literally, as though typed in place\&. Nested includes are not supported\&.
.SH "SECTION DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP
Each section in the configuration file (except for the [Global] section) describes a shared resource (known as a
\(lqvolume\(rq)\&. The section name is the name of the volume and the parameters within the section define the volume attributes and options\&.
.PP
There are two special sections, [Global] and [Homes], which are described under
\fIspecial sections\fR\&. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions\&.
.PP
A volume consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of the service\&. For volumes the
\fBpath\fR
option must specify the directory to share\&.
.PP
Any volume section without
\fBpath\fR
option is considered a
\fIvol preset\fR
which can be selected in other volume sections via the
\fBvol preset\fR
option and constitutes defaults for the volume\&. For any option specified both in a preset
\fIand\fR
in a volume section the volume section setting completely substitutes the preset option\&.
.PP
The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host system\&. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants\&.
.PP
The following sample section defines an AFP volume\&. The user has full access to the path
/foo/bar\&. The share is accessed via the share name
baz:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
 [baz]
    path = /foo/bar 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "SPECIAL SECTIONS"
.SS "The [Global] section"
.PP
Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole\&. Parameters denoted by a (G) below are must be set in this section\&.
.SS "The [Homes] section"
.PP
This section enable sharing of the UNIX server user home directories\&. Specifying an optional
\fBpath\fR
parameter means that not the whole user home will be shared but the subdirectory
\fBpath\fR\&. It is necessary to define the
\fBbasedir regex\fR
option\&. It should be a regex which matches the parent directory of the user homes\&. Parameters denoted by a (H) belong to volume sections\&. The optional parameter
\fBhome name\fR
can be used to change the AFP volume name which
\fI$u\*(Aqs home\fR
by default\&. See below under VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS\&.
.PP
The following example illustrates this\&. Given all user home directories are stored under
/home:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
 [Homes]
      path = afp\-data
      basedir regex = /home
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
For a user
\fIjohn\fR
this results in an AFP home volume with a path of
/home/john/afp\-data\&.
.PP
If
\fBbasedir regex\fR
contains symlink, set the canonicalized absolute path\&. When
/home
links to
/usr/home:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
 [Homes]
      basedir regex = /usr/home
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
Parameters define the specific attributes of sections\&.
.PP
Some parameters are specific to the [Global] section (e\&.g\&.,
\fIlog type\fR)\&. All others are permissible only in volume sections\&. The letter
\fIG\fR
in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the [Global] section\&. The letter
\fIV\fR
indicates that a parameter can be specified in a volume specific section\&.
.SH "VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS"
.PP
You can use variables in volume names\&. The use of variables in paths is not supported for now\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
if you specify an unknown variable, it will not get converted\&.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\

.RE
.SS "Charset Options"
.PP
With OS X Apple introduced the AFP3 protocol\&. One of the big changes was, that AFP3 uses Unicode names encoded as Decomposed UTF\-8 (UTF8\-MAC)\&. Previous AFP/OS versions used charsets like MacRoman, MacCentralEurope, etc\&.
.PP
To be able to serve AFP3 and older clients at the same time,
\fBafpd\fR
needs to be able to convert between UTF\-8 and Mac charsets\&. Even OS X clients partly still rely on the mac charset\&. As there\*(Aqs no way,
\fBafpd\fR
can detect the codepage a pre AFP3 client uses, you have to specify it using the
\fBmac charset\fR
option\&. The default is MacRoman, which should be fine for most western users\&.
.PP
As
\fBafpd\fR
needs to interact with UNIX operating system as well, it need\*(Aqs to be able to convert from UTF8\-MAC / Mac charset to the UNIX charset\&. By default
\fBafpd\fR
uses
\fIUTF8\fR\&. You can set the UNIX charset using the
\fBunix charset\fR
option\&. If you\*(Aqre using extended characters in the configuration files for
\fBafpd\fR, make sure your terminal matches the
\fBunix charset\fR\&.
.PP
mac charset = \fICHARSET\fR \fB(G)/(V)\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the Mac clients charset, e\&.g\&.
\fIMAC_ROMAN\fR\&. This is used to convert strings and filenames to the clients codepage for OS9 and Classic, i\&.e\&. for authentication and AFP messages (SIGUSR2 messaging)\&. This will also be the default for the volumes
\fBmac charset\fR\&. Defaults to
\fIMAC_ROMAN\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
unix charset = \fICHARSET\fR \fB(G)\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the servers unix charset, e\&.g\&.
\fIISO\-8859\-15\fR
or
\fIEUC\-JP\fR\&. This is used to convert strings to/from the systems locale, e\&.g\&. for authentication, server messages and volume names\&. If
\fILOCALE\fR
is set, the systems locale is used\&. Defaults to
\fIUTF8\fR\&.
.RE

.RS 4
Allows old Mac OS X clients (10\&.3\&.3\-10\&.4) to automagically establish a tunneled AFP connection through SSH\&. If this option is set, the server\*(Aqs answers to client\*(Aqs FPGetSrvrInfo requests contain an additional entry\&. It depends on both client\*(Aqs settings and a correctly configured and running

Setting this option is not recommended since globally encrypting AFP connections via SSH will increase the server\*(Aqs load significantly\&. On the other hand, Apple\*(Aqs client side implementation of this feature in MacOS X versions prior to 10\&.3\&.4 contained a security flaw\&.

If you want to be able to display ACLs on the client, you must setup both client and server as part on a authentication domain (directory service, eg LDAP, Open Directory, Active Directory)\&. The reason is, in OS X ACLs are bound to UUIDs, not just uid\*(Aqs or gid\*(Aqs\&.
