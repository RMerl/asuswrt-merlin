.SH "NAME"
cnid_dbd \- implement access to CNID databases through a dedicated daemon process

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
provides an interface for storage and retrieval of catalog node IDs (CNIDs) and related information to the
\fBafpd\fR
daemon\&. CNIDs are a component of Macintosh based file systems with semantics that map not easily onto Unix file systems\&. This makes separate storage in a database necessary\&.
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
is part of the
\fBCNID backend\fR
framework of
\fBafpd\fR
and implements the
\fBdbd\fR
backend\&.
.PP
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
is never started via the command line or system startup scripts but only by the
\fBcnid_metad\fR
daemon\&. There is one instance of
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
per netatalk volume\&.
.PP
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
uses the
\fBBerkeley DB\fR
database library and uses transactionally protected updates\&. The
\fBdbd\fR
backend with transactions will avoid corruption of the CNID database even if the system crashes unexpectedly\&.
.PP
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
inherits the effective userid and groupid from
\fBcnid_metad\fR
on startup, which is normally caused by
\fBafpd\fR
serving a netatalk volume to a client\&. It changes to the
\fBBerkeley DB\fR
database home directory
\fIdbdir\fR
that is associated with the volume\&. If the userid inherited from
\fBcnid_metad\fR
is 0 (root),
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
will change userid and groupid to the owner and group of the database home directory\&. Otherwise, it will continue to use the inherited values\&.
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
will then attempt to open the database and start serving requests using filedescriptor
\fIclntfd\fR\&. Subsequent instances of
\fBafpd\fR
that want to access the same volume are redirected to the running
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
process by
\fBcnid_metad\fR
via the filedescriptor
\fIctrlfd\fR\&.
.PP
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
can be configured to run forever or to exit after a period of inactivity\&. If
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
receives a TERM or an INT signal it will exit cleanly after flushing dirty database buffers to disk and closing
\fBBerkeley DB\fR
database environments\&. It is safe to terminate
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
this way, it will be restarted when necessary\&. Other signals are not handled and will cause an immediate exit, possibly leaving the CNID database in an inconsistent state (no transactions) or losing recent updates during recovery (transactions)\&.
.PP
The
\fBBerkeley DB\fR
database subsystem will create files named log\&.xxxxxxxxxx in the database home directory
\fIdbdir\fR, where xxxxxxxxxx is a monotonically increasing integer\&. These files contain the transactional database changes\&. They will be removed regularly, unless the
\fBlogfile_autoremove\fR
option is specified in the
\fIdb_param\fR
configuration file (see below) with a value of 0 (default 1)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-v, \-V\fR
.RS 4
Show version and exit\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
reads configuration information from the file
\fIdb_param\fR
in the database directory
\fIdbdir\fR
on startup\&. If the file does not exist or a parameter is not listed, suitable default values are used\&. The format for a single parameter is the parameter name, followed by one or more spaces, followed by the parameter value, followed by a newline\&. The following parameters are currently recognized:
.PP
\fBlogfile_autoremove\fR
.RS 4
If set to 0, unused Berkeley DB transactional logfiles (log\&.xxxxxxxxxx in the database home directory) are not removed on startup of
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
and on a regular basis\&. Default: 1\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcachesize\fR
.RS 4
Determines the size of the Berkeley DB cache in kilobytes\&. Default: 8192\&. Each
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
process grabs that much memory on top of its normal memory footprint\&. It can be used to tune database performance\&. The
\fBdb_stat\fR
utility with the
\fB\-m\fR
option that comes with Berkley DB can help you determine ether you need to change this value\&. The default is pretty conservative so that a large percentage of requests should be satisfied from the cache directly\&. If memory is not a bottleneck on your system you might want to leave it at that value\&. The
\fBBerkeley DB Tutorial and Reference Guide\fR
has a section
\fBSelecting a cache size\fR
that gives more detailed information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBflush_frequency\fR, \fBflush_interval\fR
.RS 4
\fIflush_frequency\fR
(Default: 1000) and
\fIflush_interval\fR
(Default: 1800) control how often changes to the database are checkpointed\&. Both of these operations are performed if either i) more than
\fIflush_frequency\fR
requests have been received or ii) more than
\fIflush_interval\fR
seconds have elapsed since the last save/checkpoint\&. Be careful to check your harddisk configuration for on disk cache settings\&. Many IDE disks just cache writes as the default behaviour, so even flushing database files to disk will not have the desired effect\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfd_table_size\fR
.RS 4
is the maximum number of connections (filedescriptors) that can be open for
\fBafpd\fR
client processes in
\fBcnid_dbd\&.\fR
Default: 512\&. If this number is exceeded, one of the existing connections is closed and reused\&. The affected
\fBafpd\fR
process will transparently reconnect later, which causes slight overhead\&. On the other hand, setting this parameter too high could affect performance in
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
since all descriptors have to be checked in a
\fBselect()\fR
system call, or worse, you might exceed the per process limit of open file descriptors on your system\&. It is safe to set the value to 1 on volumes where only one
\fBafpd\fR
client process is expected to run, e\&.g\&. home directories\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBidle_timeout\fR
.RS 4
is the number of seconds of inactivity before an idle
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
exits\&. Default: 600\&. Set this to 0 to disable the timeout\&.
.RE
.SH "UPDATING"
.PP
Note that the first version to appear
\fIafter\fR
Netatalk 2\&.1 ie Netatalk 2\&.1\&.1, will support BerkeleyDB updates on the fly without manual intervention\&. In other words Netatalk 2\&.1 does contain code to prepare the BerkeleyDB database for upgrades and to upgrade it in case it has been prepared before\&. That means it can\*(Aqt upgrade a 2\&.0\&.x version because that one didn\*(Aqt prepare the database\&.
.PP
In order to update between older Netatalk releases using different BerkeleyDB library versions, follow this steps:
