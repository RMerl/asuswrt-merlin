   Ideas:

   Keep a things_to_do list of functions to call when we know we have
   something to print.  Cleaner than current series of checks.

   Improve the printing of control prefixes.

   Expand the file name in the centered header line to a full file name.


   Concept:

   If the input_tab_char differs from the default value TAB
   (`-e[CHAR[...]]' is used), any input text tab is expanded to the
   default width of 8 spaces (compare char_to_clump). - Same as SunOS
   does.

   The treatment of the number_separator (compare add_line_number):
   The default value TAB of the number_separator (`-n[SEP[...]]') doesn't
   be thought to be an input character. An optional `-e'-input has no
   effect.
   -  With single column output
      only one POSIX requirement has to be met:
   The default n-separator should be a TAB. The consequence is a
   different width between the number and the text if the output position
   of the separator changes, i.e. it depends upon the left margin used.
   That's not nice but easy-to-use together with the defaults of other
   utilities, e.g. sort or cut. - Same as SunOS does.
   -  With multicolumn output
      two conflicting POSIX requirements exist:
   First `default n-separator is TAB', second `output text columns shall
   be of equal width'. Moreover POSIX specifies the number+separator a
   part of the column, together with `-COLUMN' and `-a -COLUMN'.
   (With -m output the number shall occupy each line only once. Exactly
   the same situation as single column output exists.)
      GNU pr gives priority to the 2nd requirement and observes POSIX
   column definition. The n-separator TAB is expanded to the same number
   of spaces in each column using the default value 8. Tabification is
   only performed if it is compatible with the output position.
   Consequence: The output text columns are of equal width. The layout
   of a page does not change if the left margin varies. - Looks better
   than the SunOS approach.
      SunOS pr gives priority to the 1st requirement. n-separator TAB
   width varies with each column. Only the width of text part of the
   column is fixed.
   Consequence: The output text columns don't have equal width. The
   widths and the layout of the whole page varies with the left margin.
   An overflow of the line length (without margin) over the input value
   PAGE_WIDTH may occur.

   The interference of the POSIX-compliant small letter options -w and -s:
   (`interference' means `setting a _separator_ with -s switches off the
   column structure and the default - not generally - page_width,
   acts on -w option')
       options:       text form  / separator:     equivalent new options:
       -w l   -s[x]
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    1.  --     --     columns    / space          --
                      trunc. to page_width = 72
    2.  --    -s[:]   full lines / TAB[:]         -J  --sep-string[="<TAB>"|:]
                      no truncation
    3.  -w l   --     columns    / space          -W l
                      trunc. to page_width = l
    4.  -w l  -s[:]   columns    / no sep.[:]     -W l  --sep-string[=:]
                      trunc. to page_width = l
    --------------------------------------------------------------------


   Options:

   Including version 1.22i:
   Some SMALL LETTER options have been redefined with the object of a
   better POSIX compliance. The output of some further cases has been
   adapted to other UNIXes. A violation of downward compatibility has to
   be accepted.
   Some NEW CAPITAL LETTER options ( -J, -S, -W) has been introduced to
   turn off unexpected interferences of small letter options (-s and -w
   together with the three column options).
   -N option and the second argument LAST_PAGE of +FIRST_PAGE offer more
   flexibility; The detailed handling of form feeds set in the input
   files requires -T option.

   Capital letter options dominate small letter ones.

   Some of the option-arguments cannot be specified as separate arguments
   from the preceding option letter (already stated in POSIX specification).

   Form feeds in the input cause page breaks in the output. Multiple
   form feeds produce empty pages.

   +FIRST_PAGE[:LAST_PAGE], --pages=FIRST_PAGE[:LAST_PAGE]
                begin [stop] printing with page FIRST_[LAST_]PAGE

   -COLUMN, --columns=COLUMN
                Produce output that is COLUMN columns wide and
                print columns down, unless -a is used. Balance number of
                lines in the columns on each page.

   -a, --across		Print columns across rather than down, used
                together with -COLUMN. The input
                one
                two
                three
                four
                will be printed with `-a -3' as
                one	two	three
                four

   -b		Balance columns on the last page.
                -b is no longer an independent option. It's always used
                together with -COLUMN (unless -a is used) to get a
                consistent formulation with "FF set by hand" in input
                files. Each formfeed found terminates the number of lines
                to be read with the actual page. The situation for
                printing columns down is equivalent to that on the last
                page. So we need a balancing.

                Keeping -b as an underground option guarantees some
                downward compatibility. Utilities using pr with -b
                (a most frequently used form) still work as usual.

   -c, --show-control-chars
                Print unprintable characters as control prefixes.
                Control-g is printed as ^G (use hat notation) and
                octal backslash notation.

   -d, --double-space	Double space the output.

   -D FORMAT, --date-format=FORMAT  Use FORMAT for the header date.

   -e[CHAR[WIDTH]], --expand-tabs[=CHAR[WIDTH]]
                Expand tabs to spaces on input.  Optional argument CHAR
                is the input TAB character. (Default is TAB).  Optional
                argument WIDTH is the input TAB character's width.
                (Default is 8.)

   -F, -f, --form-feed	Use formfeeds instead of newlines to separate
                pages. A three line HEADER is used, no TRAILER with -F,
                without -F both HEADER and TRAILER are made of five lines.

   -h HEADER, --header=HEADER
                Replace the filename in the header with the string HEADER.
                A centered header is used.

   -i[CHAR[WIDTH]], --output-tabs[=CHAR[WIDTH]]
                Replace spaces with tabs on output.  Optional argument
                CHAR is the output TAB character. (Default is TAB).
                Optional argument WIDTH is the output TAB character's
                width. (Default is 8)

   -J, --join-lines	Merge lines of full length, turns off -W/-w
                line truncation, no column alignment, --sep-string[=STRING]
                sets separators, works with all column options
                (-COLUMN | -a -COLUMN | -m).
                -J has been introduced (together with -W and --sep-string) to
                disentangle the old (POSIX compliant) options -w, -s
                along with the 3 column options.

   -l PAGE_LENGTH, --length=PAGE_LENGTH
                Set the page length to PAGE_LENGTH lines. Default is 66,
                including 5 lines of HEADER and 5 lines of TRAILER
                without -F, but only 3 lines of HEADER and no TRAILER
                with -F (i.e the number of text lines defaults to 56 or
                63 respectively).

   -m, --merge		Print files in parallel; pad_across_to align
                columns; truncate lines and print separator strings;
                Do it also with empty columns to get a continuous line
                numbering and column marking by separators throughout
                the whole merged file.

                Empty pages in some input files produce empty columns
                [marked by separators] in the merged pages. Completely
                empty merged pages show no column separators at all.

                The layout of a merged page is ruled by the largest form
                feed distance of the single pages at that page. Shorter
                columns will be filled up with empty lines.

                Together with -J option join lines of full length and
                set separators when -S option is used.

   -n[SEP[DIGITS]], --number-lines[=SEP[DIGITS]]
                Provide DIGITS digit line numbering (default for DIGITS
                is 5). With multicolumn output the number occupies the
                first DIGITS column positions of each text column or only
                each line of -m output.
                With single column output the number precedes each line
                just as -m output.
                Optional argument SEP is the character appended to the
                line number to separate it from the text followed.
                The default separator is a TAB. In a strict sense a TAB
                is always printed with single column output only. The
                TAB-width varies with the TAB-position, e.g. with the
                left margin specified by -o option.
                With multicolumn output priority is given to `equal width
                of output columns' (a POSIX specification). The TAB-width
                is fixed to the value of the 1st column and does not
                change with different values of left margin. That means a
                fixed number of spaces is always printed in the place of
                a TAB. The tabification depends upon the output
                position.

                Default counting of the line numbers starts with 1st
                line of the input file (not the 1st line printed,
                compare the --page option and -N option).

   -N NUMBER, --first-line-number=NUMBER
                Start line counting with the number NUMBER at the 1st
                line of first page printed (mostly not the 1st line of
                the input file).

   -o MARGIN, --indent=MARGIN
                Offset each line with a margin MARGIN spaces wide.
                Total page width is the size of the margin plus the
                PAGE_WIDTH set with -W/-w option.

   -r, --no-file-warnings
                Omit warning when a file cannot be opened.

   -s[CHAR], --separator[=CHAR]
                Separate columns by a single character CHAR, default for
                CHAR is the TAB character without -w and 'no char' with -w.
                Without `-s' default separator `space' is set.
                -s[CHAR] turns off line truncation of all 3 column options
                (-COLUMN|-a -COLUMN|-m) except -w is set. That is a POSIX
                compliant formulation. The source code translates -s into
                the new options -S and -J, also -W if required.

   -S STRING, --sep-string[=STRING]
                Separate columns by any string STRING. The -S option
                doesn't react upon the -W/-w option (unlike -s option
                does). It defines a separator nothing else.
                Without -S: Default separator TAB is used with -J and
                `space' otherwise (same as -S" ").
                With -S "": No separator is used.
                Quotes should be used with blanks and some shell active
                characters.
                -S is problematic because in its obsolete form you
                cannot use -S "STRING", but in its standard form you
                must use -S "STRING" if STRING is empty.  Use
                --sep-string to avoid the ambiguity.

   -t, --omit-header	Do not print headers or footers but retain form
                feeds set in the input files.

   -T, --omit-pagination
                Do not print headers or footers, eliminate any pagination
                by form feeds set in the input files.

   -v, --show-nonprinting
                Print unprintable characters as escape sequences. Use
                octal backslash notation. Control-G becomes \007.

   -w PAGE_WIDTH, --width=PAGE_WIDTH
                Set page width to PAGE_WIDTH characters for multiple
                text-column output only (default for PAGE_WIDTH is 72).
                -s[CHAR] turns off the default page width and any line
                truncation. Lines of full length will be merged,
                regardless of the column options set. A POSIX compliant
                formulation.

   -W PAGE_WIDTH, --page-width=PAGE_WIDTH
                Set the page width to PAGE_WIDTH characters. That's valid
                with and without a column option. Text lines will be
                truncated, unless -J is used. Together with one of the
                column options (-COLUMN| -a -COLUMN| -m) column alignment
                is always used.
                Default is 72 characters.
                Without -W PAGE_WIDTH
                - but with one of the column options default truncation of
                  72 characters is used (to keep downward compatibility
                  and to simplify most frequently met column tasks).
                  Column alignment and column separators are used.
                - and without any of the column options NO line truncation
                  is used (to keep downward compatibility and to meet most
                  frequent tasks). That's equivalent to  -W 72 -J .

                With/without  -W PAGE_WIDTH  the header line is always
                truncated to avoid line overflow.

                (In pr versions newer than 1.14 -S option does no longer
                affect -W option.)

/* Each column has one of these structures allocated for it.
   If we're only dealing with one file, fp is the same for all
   columns.

   The general strategy is to spend time setting up these column
   structures (storing columns if necessary), after which printing
   is a matter of flitting from column to column and calling
   print_func.

   Parallel files, single files printing across in multiple
   columns, and single files printing down in multiple columns all
   fit the same printing loop.

   print_func		Function used to print lines in this column.
                        If we're storing this column it will be
                        print_stored(), Otherwise it will be read_line().

   char_func		Function used to process characters in this column.
                        If we're storing this column it will be store_char(),
                        otherwise it will be print_char().

   current_line		Index of the current entry in line_vector, which
                        contains the index of the first character of the
                        current line in buff[].

   lines_stored		Number of lines in this column which are stored in
                        buff.

   lines_to_print	If we're storing this column, lines_to_print is
                        the number of stored_lines which remain to be
                        printed.  Otherwise it is the number of lines
                        we can print without exceeding lines_per_body.

   start_position	The horizontal position we want to be in before we
                        print the first character in this column.

   numbered		True means precede this column with a line number. */
