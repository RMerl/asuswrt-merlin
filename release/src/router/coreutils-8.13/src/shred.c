/*
 * Do a more secure overwrite of given files or devices, to make it harder
 * for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data.
 *
 * Although this process is also known as "wiping", I prefer the longer
 * name both because I think it is more evocative of what is happening and
 * because a longer name conveys a more appropriate sense of deliberateness.
 *
 * For the theory behind this, see "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic
 * and Solid-State Memory", on line at
 * http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html
 *
 * Just for the record, reversing one or two passes of disk overwrite
 * is not terribly difficult with hardware help.  Hook up a good-quality
 * digitizing oscilloscope to the output of the head preamplifier and copy
 * the high-res digitized data to a computer for some off-line analysis.
 * Read the "current" data and average all the pulses together to get an
 * "average" pulse on the disk.  Subtract this average pulse from all of
 * the actual pulses and you can clearly see the "echo" of the previous
 * data on the disk.
 *
 * Real hard drives have to balance the cost of the media, the head,
 * and the read circuitry.  They use better-quality media than absolutely
 * necessary to limit the cost of the read circuitry.  By throwing that
 * assumption out, and the assumption that you want the data processed
 * as fast as the hard drive can spin, you can do better.
 *
 * If asked to wipe a file, this also unlinks it, renaming it to in a
 * clever way to try to leave no trace of the original filename.
 *
 * This was inspired by a desire to improve on some code titled:
 * Wipe V1.0-- Overwrite and delete files.  S. 2/3/96
 * but I've rewritten everything here so completely that no trace of
 * the original remains.
 *
 * Thanks to:
 * Bob Jenkins, for his good RNG work and patience with the FSF copyright
 * paperwork.
 * Jim Meyering, for his work merging this into the GNU fileutils while
 * still letting me feel a sense of ownership and pride.  Getting me to
 * tolerate the GNU brace style was quite a feat of diplomacy.
 * Paul Eggert, for lots of useful discussion and code.  I disagree with
 * an awful lot of his suggestions, but they're disagreements worth having.
 *
 * Things to think about:
 * - Security: Is there any risk to the race
 *   between overwriting and unlinking a file?  Will it do anything
 *   drastically bad if told to attack a named pipe or socket?

/*
 * The passes start and end with a random pass, and the passes in between
 * are done in random order.  The idea is to deprive someone trying to
 * reverse the process of knowledge of the overwrite patterns, so they
 * have the additional step of figuring out what was done to the disk
 * before they can try to reverse or cancel it.
 *
 * First, all possible 1-bit patterns.  There are two of them.
 * Then, all possible 2-bit patterns.  There are four, but the two
 * which are also 1-bit patterns can be omitted.
 * Then, all possible 3-bit patterns.  Likewise, 8-2 = 6.
 * Then, all possible 4-bit patterns.  16-4 = 12.
 *
 * The basic passes are:
 * 1-bit: 0x000, 0xFFF
 * 2-bit: 0x555, 0xAAA
 * 3-bit: 0x249, 0x492, 0x924, 0x6DB, 0xB6D, 0xDB6 (+ 1-bit)
 *        100100100100         110110110110
 *           9   2   4            D   B   6
 * 4-bit: 0x111, 0x222, 0x333, 0x444, 0x666, 0x777,
 *        0x888, 0x999, 0xBBB, 0xCCC, 0xDDD, 0xEEE (+ 1-bit, 2-bit)
 * Adding three random passes at the beginning, middle and end
 * produces the default 25-pass structure.
 *
 * The next extension would be to 5-bit and 6-bit patterns.
 * There are 30 uncovered 5-bit patterns and 64-8-2 = 46 uncovered
 * 6-bit patterns, so they would increase the time required
 * significantly.  4-bit patterns are enough for most purposes.
 *
 * The main gotcha is that this would require a trickier encoding,
 * since lcm(2,3,4) = 12 bits is easy to fit into an int, but
 * lcm(2,3,4,5) = 60 bits is not.
 *
 * One extension that is included is to complement the first bit in each
 * 512-byte block, to alter the phase of the encoded data in the more
 * complex encodings.  This doesn't apply to MFM, so the 1-bit patterns
 * are considered part of the 3-bit ones and the 2-bit patterns are
 * considered part of the 4-bit patterns.
 *
 *
 * How does the generalization to variable numbers of passes work?
 *
 * Here's how...
 * Have an ordered list of groups of passes.  Each group is a set.
 * Take as many groups as will fit, plus a random subset of the
 * last partial group, and place them into the passes list.
 * Then shuffle the passes list into random order and use that.
 *
 * One extra detail: if we can't include a large enough fraction of the
 * last group to be interesting, then just substitute random passes.
 *
 * If you want more passes than the entire list of groups can
 * provide, just start repeating from the beginning of the list.
