.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input,
writing to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-complement\fR
use the complement of SET1
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR
delete characters in SET1, do not translate
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-squeeze\-repeats\fR
replace each input sequence of a repeated character
that is listed in SET1 with a single occurrence
of that character
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-truncate\-set1\fR
first truncate SET1 to length of SET2
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
SETs are specified as strings of characters.  Most represent themselves.
Interpreted sequences are:
.TP
\eNNN
character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)
.TP
\e\e
backslash
.TP
\ea
audible BEL
.TP
\eb
backspace
.TP
\ef
form feed
.TP
\en
new line
.TP
\er
return
.TP
\et
horizontal tab
.TP
\ev
vertical tab
.TP
CHAR1\-CHAR2
all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order
.TP
[CHAR*]
in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1
.TP
[CHAR*REPEAT]
REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0
.TP
[:alnum:]
all letters and digits
.TP
[:alpha:]
all letters
.TP
[:blank:]
all horizontal whitespace
.TP
[:cntrl:]
all control characters
.TP
[:digit:]
all digits
.TP
[:graph:]
all printable characters, not including space
.TP
[:lower:]
all lower case letters
.TP
[:print:]
all printable characters, including space
.TP
[:punct:]
all punctuation characters
.TP
[:space:]
all horizontal or vertical whitespace
.TP
[:upper:]
all upper case letters
.TP
[:xdigit:]
all hexadecimal digits
.TP
[=CHAR=]
all characters which are equivalent to CHAR
.PP
Translation occurs if \fB\-d\fR is not given and both SET1 and SET2 appear.
\fB\-t\fR may be used only when translating.  SET2 is extended to length of
SET1 by repeating its last character as necessary.  Excess characters
of SET2 are ignored.  Only [:lower:] and [:upper:] are guaranteed to
expand in ascending order; used in SET2 while translating, they may
only be used in pairs to specify case conversion.  \fB\-s\fR uses SET1 if not
translating nor deleting; else squeezing uses SET2 and occurs after
translation or deletion.
