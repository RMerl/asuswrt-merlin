.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.
In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.
In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.
Create hard links by default, symbolic links with \fB\-\-symbolic\fR.
When creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links
can hold arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link is
interpreted in relation to its parent directory.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-\-backup\fR[=\fICONTROL\fR]
make a backup of each existing destination file
.TP
\fB\-b\fR
like \fB\-\-backup\fR but does not accept an argument
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-directory\fR
allow the superuser to attempt to hard link
directories (note: will probably fail due to
system restrictions, even for the superuser)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
remove existing destination files
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
prompt whether to remove destinations
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-logical\fR
make hard links to symbolic link references
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-dereference\fR
treat destination that is a symlink to a
directory as if it were a normal file
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-physical\fR
make hard links directly to symbolic links
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-symbolic\fR
make symbolic links instead of hard links
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-suffix\fR=\fISUFFIX\fR
override the usual backup suffix
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-target\-directory\fR=\fIDIRECTORY\fR
specify the DIRECTORY in which to create
the links
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-no\-target\-directory\fR
treat LINK_NAME as a normal file
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
print name of each linked file
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
The backup suffix is `~', unless set with \fB\-\-suffix\fR or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.
The version control method may be selected via the \fB\-\-backup\fR option or through
the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:
.PP
Using \fB\-s\fR ignores \fB\-L\fR and \fB\-P\fR.  Otherwise, the last option specified controls
behavior when the source is a symbolic link, defaulting to \fB\-P\fR.
.TP
none, off
never make backups (even if \fB\-\-backup\fR is given)
.TP
numbered, t
make numbered backups
.TP
existing, nil
numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
.TP
simple, never
always make simple backups
