	is a FIFO, too.

2006-09-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Treating / specially): --preserve-root is
	now the default for rm.
	(rm invocation): Likewise.  Also, document that you can't
	remove `.' or `..'.  Use the POSIX term "root directory"
	rather than the more-ambiguous "file system root".

2006-08-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* .cvsignore: Add Makefile.in, coreutils.html, coreutils.pdf,
	coreutils.ps, coreutils.tps.  Remove coreutils.cm (dunno what it

	as it is subsumed by coreutils.info*.

2006-08-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

2006-08-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* perm.texi (Changing Special Mode Bits): Clarify u+s versus
	a+s versus +s, and likewise for g+s.
	(Numeric Modes): Bring back example of 0055 == 55.  4755 no
	longer clears setgid bit on directories.
	(Directory Setuid and Setgid): Numeric modes now affect setuid
	and setgid on directories only if they set these bits.  This
	is so that leading 0 has no effect on numeric modes.

2006-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (What information is listed): Mention that missing
	pieces of information are marked with "?".  From Paul Eggert.

2006-07-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* perm.texi (Directory Setuid and Setgid): Explain that this is a
	GNU extension, and that other systems behave differently here.

2006-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (What information is listed): Clarify that the
	restricted deletion flag is another name for the sticky bit.
	* perm.texi (Mode Structure): The restricted deletion flag
	restricts only unprivileged users.
	(Mode Structure, Symbolic Modes, Numeric Modes): Be more careful
	about distinguishing file mode bits from permissions bits,
	and about execute versus search permission.  The FreeBSD command
	is chflags, not chrflags.

2006-07-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi: Change GNU to @acronym{GNU} in a few places.
	Use "set-user-ID" and "set-group-ID" a bit more consistently.
	Use "appropriate privileges" rather than "super-user" a bit
	more consistently.
	(install invocation): Parent directories are now 755 without uid
	or gid changing.  The default mode is now 0755, not 755.
	(mkdir invocation): Rewrite the top-level usage description, since
	I couldn't easily follow the old one.  It's now 3 lines not 8.
	For -m, describe file permission bits versus other bits, and note
	that mkdir is atomic if you don't mention special bits.
	(chmod invocation): Mention what chmod does to setgid and setuid bits.
	* perm.texi (Mode Structure): Modernize the explanation of the
	setuid and setgid bits on directories.
	(Changing Special Mode Bits): Mention that a implies both u and g
	for s.  Cross reference to new node.
	(Numeric Modes): Don't claim that 0055 is the same as 55; this isn't
	true any more.  Mention new node.
	4755 is now like u=rwxs,go=rx,g-s, not like u=rwxs,go=rx.
	(Directory Setuid and Setgid): New node.

2006-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (Squeezing): Separate doubled "the", so typo-checkers
	don't complain.

	* Makefile.am (check-texinfo): Enforce the zeros vs. zeroes consistency.

2006-07-08  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* coreutils.texi: Fix some typos.  Use `zeros' consistently (both
	`zeros' and `zeroes' are correct).

2006-07-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (tail invocation): With no operand, 'tail -f' now
	silently ignores the '-f' only if standard input is a FIFO or pipe
	and POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.

2006-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (seq invocation): seq now uses long double
	internally rather than double.  It now defaults to a minimal fixed
	point format if possible.  It lets you use %a, %A, %E, %F, %G.
	Don't assume printf doesn't work for numbers that fit in 64 but
	not 32 bits; typically they work these days.  Improve discussion
	of large integers and update the rounding-error numbers.

2006-06-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (sort invocation): 'sort +1 -2' is now supported
	even when conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001, since this is a pure
	extension to POSIX.

2006-06-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (wc invocation): Remove ./ prefix from example.
	From Padraig Brady.

2006-06-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

2006-06-20  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* coreutils.texi (sleep invocation): Document that accepting
	multiple arguments and suffixes are extensions.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.

2006-06-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* Makefile.am (check-texinfo): Use $(_W) and $(W_) instead of
	assuming grep -w (which is not portable).

2006-05-27  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* Makefile.am: Use `AM_MAKEINFOFLAGS' rather than
	overwriting `MAKEINFO', so that `missing' can do its job.

	* Makefile.am (check-texinfo): Use `$(EGREP)' instead of `grep -E'.
	(check-texinfo): Use literal `{' only in brackets, i.e., [{] or [}],
	to avoid triggering an error from Solaris 2.6's grep.

2006-05-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	--group-directories-first.

2006-04-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (What information is listed): Add P for Solaris
	10 ports.  Add commented-out entries for other types that POSIX
	says are possible, or that I observed in FreeBSD documentation.

2006-04-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (Input processing in ptx): Remove mention of the
	default --ignore file, /usr/local/lib/eign.  That file has never
	been used.  Reported by Eric Blake.

2006-04-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (expr invocation): expr exit status is 3 only for
	internal errors now; 2 is also for invalid values in expressions.

	* coreutils.texi (General options in ptx): Undocument --copyright.

2006-03-27  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* coreutils.texi (dirname invocation): Macro in previous patch
	was too broad.

	Improve documentation to match recent // patches.

2006-03-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	backslash-escape causes an error message -- it doesn't.
	Mention that `\' also removes any special significance, so
	is useful for [, ], *, -.  Prompted by Richard Neill in

	order bit.

	count is optional, so put square brackets around it.

2006-01-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* getdate.texi (General date syntax): Invalid dates are rejected.
	(Time of day items): Mention the possibility of leap seconds.
	Problem reported by Dr. David Alan Gilbert.

	* coreutils.texi: Use @acronym around "ISO" uniformly.
	(Date conversion specifiers): Explain %g, %G, and %V a bit better.

2006-01-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (tail invocation): Say that --retry
	is useful `mainly' (not `only') when following by name.

2006-01-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Time conversion specifiers, Options for date):
	Document date --rfc-3339 and new specifiers %:z, %::z, %:::z.  Use
	"date and time" consistently; the old version sometimes said "time

	Use a consistent format for terms like "RFC".

	(available on MS-DOS-like platforms only).  Explain when text and
	binary mode are used now.

	used now.

2005-07-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (ln invocation): Examples, from Bob Proulx.

2005-06-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use "file name" when talking about file names, instead of "filename"
	or "path", as per the GNU coding standards.
	* coreutils.texi (readlink invocation): "path component" ->
	"component", since we don't use the POSIX "path" nomenclature.

2005-05-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* getdate.texi (General date syntax): Don't say that date
	date --iso-8601=ns generates acceptable dates; it doesn't yet.
	Problem reported by Nic Ferrier.

2005-05-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (ls invocation): ls --indicator-style=directory
	renamed to ls --indicator-style=slash, to avoid confusion with ls
	--directory.

2005-04-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* perm.texi (Mode Structure, Changing Special Permissions):
	(Conditional Executability, Numeric Modes):
	These days the sticky bit is more often uses as the restricted
	deletion flag, so modernize the discussion about this.
	(Mode Structure): Linux/GNU -> GNU/Linux.
	(Symbolic Modes): Don't imply that "+ur" or "u" is valid.
	(Setting Permissions): Don't imply that "+t" is invalid.
	Use "rwx" rather than the less-common "rxw" in an example.
	(Copying Permissions): Say that ugo is a replacement for
	a string of the other letters.  Add spaces around examples.
	Use "set-user-ID" rather than "set user ID" to avoid ambiguity.
	Use "+t" rather than "o+t", since POSIX doesn't specify the latter.
	Mention which combinations are portable and which are GNU.
	(Numeric Modes): Don't imply they aren't portable; they are
	nowadays.

2005-04-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Standards conformance): Do not mention head -10,
	since it now works the same regardless of POSIX version.
	(od invocation): -w N -> -w[N].
	(pr invocation): -S STRING -> -SSTRING.
	(fold invocation): -WIDTH works even when conforming to POSIX
	1003.1-2001.

	(Options for date): -I timespec -> -I[timespec].

2005-04-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (install invocation): Use a= instead of 0 for
	the point of departure for -m, and explain what it meeams.
	(mkdir invocation, mkfifo invocation, mknod invocation):
	The umask does not affect the point of departure.
	Problem reported by Mike Stone.

2005-04-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi: For consistency, standardize on "user ID" rather
	than "uid" or "UID" or "user id".  Similarly for "group ID".

2005-04-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (rm invocation): Say that --recursive removes
	listed directories too, not just their contents.

2005-04-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (dd invocation): Document the distinction between

	* coreutils.texi (cat invocation, chown invocation)
	(chgrp invocation, basename invocation, dirname invocation):
	Add examples, which are copies of the examples newly added
	to the usage messages.
	(ln invocation): Use same format as other examples above,
	for consistency.

2005-03-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi: Clarify NUL vs null byte vs null character.

2005-03-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2005-03-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Formatting file timestamps): Very long timestamps
	may be treated as errors.

2005-03-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (date invocation): Use an example that makes it
	clear tha the default date use space-padded day of month.
	Replace "directive" with "conversion specifier" to be consistent
	with POSIX.  All uses changed.

	For %p and %P, mention handling of noon and midnight.
	For %s, use ISO 8601, and mention handling of leap seconds.
	For %S, clarify mention of leap seconds.
	For %T, say that it's the same as %H:%M:%S.
	For %X, don't say that it must be the same as %H:%M:%S.
	For %z and %Z, clarify which time zones are used.  These options
	are now affected by --date, so don't claim that they're not.
	(Date directives): %C is now all but the last two chars of %Y.
	For %D, say that it's equivalent to %m/%d/%y.
	For %e, use blank in example.
	For %h, use @code for %b.
	For %Y, mention what happens with outlandish years.
	(Padding and other flags): Renamed from Padding.
	Mention that the flags are GNU extensions.
	Mention the 0 and ^ flags.
	Mention field widths an modifiers.
	(Examples of date): - is a flag, not a modifier.

2005-01-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Specify that a string
	of zero digits is interpreted as 0.  Reported by Ulrich Hermisson.

2005-01-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (shred invocation): Clarify that shred works fine
	with journaled file systems that are configured not to journal
	file system data.  Also mention BFS and NTFS.

2004-12-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (ls invocation): Change minor problem to be
	"subdirectory not found", since top-level trouble is now serious.
	(dircolors invocation): Quote argument to eval.  Problem reported
	by Stephane Chazelas.

2004-12-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (join invocation): Mention that blank separators
	in the -o option need to be quoted.  Problem reported by Phil Clayton.

2004-12-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (id invocation): -G also prints main group.
	Problem reported by Tim Waugh.

2004-12-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (ls invocation): Document new "ls" exit status.

2004-12-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* getdate.texi (Time of day items, Time zone items):
	Describe new formats +00:00, UTC+00:00.

2004-12-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (cut invocation): Say when --complement is useful.

2004-10-01  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	* coreutils.texi (cut invocation): Document --complement and
	adjust the documentation of -b, -c, -f.

2004-11-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (du invocation): Use if=/dev/null rather
	than :|.  Problem reported by Dan Jacobson.
	Use "seek=2GiB" rather than the wordier "seek=`echo '2^31'|bc`".
	Say "KiB" not the (inaccurate) "kilobytes".
	Similarly for "GiB" and "gigabytes".

2004-11-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi: Changes inspired by Debian coreutils 5.2.1-2.
	(General output formatting): -x doesn't have an operand.
	(Formatting the file names): Warn that even with -N unprintable
	chars are still printed as '?' some times.
	(rm invocation): Reword rm -d to note that it's sometimes useful
	on non-directories.
	(logname invocation, users invocation, who invocation):
	The utmp and wtmp file names vary from system to system.

	* getdate.texi (General date syntax): "next" is 1, not 2.
	Document that "second" isn't allowed as an ordinal number.

2004-11-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (dd invocation): Reword the new dd message.

2004-11-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (dd invocation): dd now outputs total bytes,
	seconds, and bytes per second.

2004-11-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* Makefile.am (_W, W_): New macros.
	(check-texinfo): Use them instead of assuming grep -w (which is not
	portable).

2004-10-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi: Document TZ better, and adjust to new getdate.texi.
	(Top): Update menu.
	(pr invocation, Formatting file timestamps, touch invocation,
	stat invocation, who invocation, date invocation, Options for date):
	Mention TZ.
	* getdate.texi: Sync from gnulib.

2004-10-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Standards conformance): Use "head -10" rather
	than "head -1" as example of obsolete usage, since the POSIX
	consensus is that "head -1" could be supported even if we don't
	yet have clear consensus on "head -10".  See today's revision to
	the SUS FAQ
	<http://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/single_unix_faq.html>.

2004-10-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (pathchk invocation): Options must precede operands.

2004-10-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (pathchk invocation): Overall lengths are
	OS limits, not file system limits.  Component length checks
	apply to all components, not merely to existing ones.  Say
	that nonexistent names are not errors.  For -p, omit all
	checks based on the underlying file system, not merely length
	checks.  Explain what the portable file name character set is.

2004-10-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (printf invocation): Mention ISO/IEC 10646 as
	well as Unicode.  Various minor formatting cleanups.

2004-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Move LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE
	index entries to proper paragraph.

2004-10-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (check-texinfo): Add `builtin' and `builtins' to
	the list of words to avoid.

2004-10-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Special built-in utilities): New node.
	(printf invocation): builtin -> built-in, for consistency
	with POSIX terminology.
	(test invocation, pwd invocation):
	Use specific rather than generic language to warn about
	built-in commands.
	(chroot invocation, env invocation, nice invocation, nohup invocation):
	Warn that command must not be a special built-in.
	(env invocation): Warn about environment variables with unusual
	spellings, or duplicates.

2004-09-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (ls invocation): Document "ls --hide".

2004-09-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (chmod invocation): Warn about "chmod -w file".

2004-09-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (tail invocation): Fix bugs in the description of
	the obsolete syntax (e.g., it does not support -k or -m).  Warn
	about usages like "tail -" and "tail -c 4" that are ambigous on
	older systems.

2004-09-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (mv invocation, rm invocation): Say "the response
	is affirmative" rather than "the response begins with y or Y",
	so that the documentation is accurate in non-English locales.
	Problem reported by Munzir Taha.

2004-09-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (dd invocation): Distinguish between options
	(e.g., --help) and operands (e.g., if=file).  Move miscellaneous
	stuff after the operand descriptions, for clarity.

2004-09-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (sort invocation): -u disables the last-resort
	comparison, too.  Revamp its description.
	(test invocation): Document -r, -w, -x more carefully.

2004-09-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Common options): Some programs don't reorder
	options.
	(tr invocation, echo invocation, printf invocation, test invocation,
	expr invocation, basename invocation, chroot invocation,
	nice invocation, nohup invocation, seq invocation):
	This program doesn't reorder options.
	(tr invocation): Mention --help, --version, --.
	(echo invocation): Mention that -- isn't special.
	(test invocation): Mention that the expression is optional,
	and that test ! EXPR is like ! test EXPR.
	Mention that -h and -L don't dereference symlinks.
	(expr invocation): Mention --help, --version.

	* coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Add remarks about sort -u
	versus sort | uniq.  Prompted by a question from Andrew Noymer.

2004-09-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (od invocation): Several changes for POSIX
	and FreeBSD compatibility.  Add support for XSI syntax
	(POSIX 1003.1-2004).  Rename -s[N] to -S N.  Remove documentation
	for -h.  -i is now -t dI (not d2) and -l is now -t dL (not d4).

2004-09-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (String tests): Improve quality of warning about
	quoting strings for the shell.

2004-09-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (dd invocation): Specify which conversion options
	are mutually exclusive.  Give a bit more detail about ascii,
	ebcdic, and ibm conversions.

2004-08-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	POSIX-conformance fixes for "expand" and "unexpand".
	* coreutils.texi: Standardize on "tab stop" (the POSIX usage)
	rather than "tabstop".
	(unexpand invocation): Use "blank" rather than "space" when
	POSIX requires "blank".  Define "blank".  Initial blanks are
	converted even if there's just one.  For -a, convert two or
	more blanks only if they occur just before a tab stop.

2004-08-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (chown invocation): Fix synopsis:
	group must always be preceded by separator.
	"chown : file" and "chown '' file" don't change the owner or group.
	Update the explanation of what happens to the set-user-ID or
	set-group-ID bits, e.g., they sometimes are not cleared if they
	denote mandatory locking.  Change "find"-oriented examples to use
	chown -h.

2004-08-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (printf invocation): Clarify how "printf" is
	supposed to work with extra arguments, missing arguments, etc.

2004-08-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	POSIX-conformance fixes for "-" used as an operand.
	* coreutils.texi (Common options): Clarify that "-" means
	stdin/stdout only when it is an operand, not when it is an
	option-argument.
	(shred invocation): "shred -- -" is equivalent to "shred -",
	not to "shred ./-".
	(tee invocation): "tee -" means to copy (again) to stdout.

2004-07-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (nice invocation): Document the "nice value", and
	how it affects the scheduling priority.  (The old documentation
	implied that the nice value equaled the scheduling priority, which
	isn't accurate.)  Document that the range of nice values might
	exceed -20..19.  Specify what happens when you give a nice value
	that is out of range, or when you don't have permissions to lower
	the nice value.  Bash doesn't have a builtin 'nice', so don't say
	"most shells" have one.

2004-04-03  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* coreutils.texi (readlink invocation): Document new
	"readlink -f" behaviour and new canonicalize options, -e and -m.

2004-07-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (check-texinfo): Disallow `filename' in .texi files.
	Spell it like `file name' instead, to be consistent.
	Fail if a @footnote directive follows non-punctuation.
	Fail upon use of @url.  Use @uref instead.

2004-07-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Common options, Target directory, cp invocation,
	install invocation, mv invocation, ln invocation): Add -t as a
	short option for --target-directory, and -T as a short option for
	--no-target-directory.  Clean up relevant synopses a bit, so that
	the language is similar for all.

2004-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi: Put the right amount of space at sentence ends.
	Make sure "i.e." and "e.g." are followed by commas (the GNU style).
	Put blank lines before and after every @example, prefer the
	previous line to end in ":" (when not a sentence end, for consistency),
	and prepend @noindent to the following line when appropriate.
	In examples, use "--" arguments when needed to prevent undesired
	interpretation of operands as options.
	Use "file name" rather than "filename", as per the GNU coding standards.
	Remove unwanted spaces before @footnote.
	Use "---" when appropriate, instead of " -- ".
	Use "name" (or something like that) rather than "path" or "pathname",
	since the GNU coding standards don't allow "path".
	Use @acronym, @command, @minus{}, @samp in a few places,
	where appropriate.
	(Target directory): Clarify description of example.
	(fmt invocation): Give issue number for reference, and reword
	for clarity.
	(sort invocation): Note that xargs without -0 also mishandles
	file names containing some special characters other than newline.
	(Translating): Mention that \012 is not universally portable.
	Use '\0' rather than '\000'.
	(Squeezing): bourne -> Bourne.
	Fix unportable usage of '\n' by replacing it with '[\n*]'.
	(More details about version sort): Remove unnecessary indent
	in examples.
	(dd invocation): Use 'kill -s USR1', not 'kill -USR1', as POSIX
	indicates that the former is more portable (the latter is an XSI
	extension).
	(shred invocation): Use @uref rather than @url, and use a more-typical
	style for the date.
	(kill invocation): Clarify usage; for example, "kill -s TERM -1"
	isn't allowed.
	(seq invocation): Reword to avoid implying that printf necessarily
	fails for numbers outside the 32-bit range.  Prefer separating
	options from their operands.
	(Opening the software toolbox): Give an online reference to
	Robbins's article, and give a date.  Don't imply that the
	current documentation is unchanged from his article.
	(Putting the tools together): Rework examples so that they don't
	assume the C locale; nowadays many users now operate outside the C
	locale by default.  While we're at it, don't assume ASCII either.
	Indent example to match actual output from GNU uniq.  Remove some
	unnecessary and confusing brackets from 'tr' operands.  "Software
	Tools in Pascal" is back in print, according to Amazon anyway.
	Add references to Kernighan's online copies of examples.

2004-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi, perm.texi: Standardize on "file system" rather
	than "filesystem", as POSIX prefers it with a space.

2004-06-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (Common options, Target directory, cp
	invocation, install invocation, mv invocation, ln invocation):
	Likewise.
	(link invocation): Explain how to rewrite link using ln now
	that we have --no-target-directory.
	(ln invocation): Explain that --no-target-directory subsumes
	--no-dereference.
	(unlink invocation): Modify wording to match new wording in
	link invocation.

2004-06-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (install invocation): Document
	--target-directory in synopsis, too.

2004-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (yes invocation): "--" is now supported.
	(false invocation, true invocation): --help and --version now
	work unconditionally.

2004-06-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi: Remove menu references to just-removed subsection.

2004-06-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (tr invocation): Remove the section describing
	how POSIXLY_CORRECT changes tr's behavior.

2004-06-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (cut invocation): Clarify what --output-delimiter=STR
	does with byte/character ranges.

2004-06-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (tr invocation): Mention -C.

2004-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (echo invocation): Document today's changes.

2004-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Document that "sort -m -o F"
	might write F before reading all the input.

2004-05-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (stat invocation): Change IO to I/O.
	* Makefile.am (check-texinfo): Check for the above.

2004-04-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Mention -k earlier, so
	that the options are in alphabetical order.  Describe how -b works
	more-accurately; this involves fixing some examples, too.  Mention

2003-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	thus now requiring texinfo-4.2 to create the .info file.

2002-02-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi (File characteristic tests): Document the
	behavior of test -nt and -ot when one of the files does not exist,
	using the same behavior that is documented in ksh93.

2002-03-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi (cut invocation): Say that selected input is
	written in the same order that it is read, and is written
	exactly once.

2002-03-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Make cp -r equivalent to cp -R.  Add a new cp option --copy-contents
	for people who want to emulate the traditional (and rarely desirable)
	cp -r behavior.

	* coreutils.texi (cp invocation): Document this.
	Fix some related minor bugs: --no-dereference is no longer
	equivalent to -d, and --archive (-a) can override the other
	symlink options.  Warn that cp -R is not portable on symbolic
	links unless you also specify -P.

2002-03-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (cp invocation): Document that cp -r
	preserves symlinks.  Emphasize non-portability of cp -r.

2002-02-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi (Time directives): Add %N for nanoseconds.
	This documents the recent change to 'ls'.

2002-02-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (pr invocation): Reword to avoid using `:'
	in an @opindex entry -- info doesn't permit it.

	* coreutils.texi (Formatting file timestamps): Document new
	time-formatting method: --time-style=+FORMAT.

2002-02-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi (seq invocation): In the example, use "tail
	-n 3", not "tail -3", to conform to POSIX 1003.1-2001.

2002-02-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (tsort background): New section.
	From Ian Lance Taylor.

	* coreutils.texi (START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY): Remove a few entries
	and clean up a few others based on suggestions from Bob Proulx.

2002-02-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for POSIX 1003.1-2001, which requires removal for
	support of obsolete "+" option syntax in sort, tail, and uniq.
	* coreutils.texi: Document this.  (Also, document a similar
	change to "touch", for fileutils).

2002-01-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (shred invocation): List some journaled filesystems.

	Thanks to Dan Jacobson for suggesting the examples.

2001-11-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Recommend setting LC_ALL=C,
	not LC_COLLATE=C.  Explain how the latter can cause problems.
	Based on a message from Paul Eggert.
	(ls invocation): Recommend setting LC_ALL=C, not LC_COLLATE=C.

2001-10-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (cp invocation): Describe --reply=...

2001-10-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (cp invocation): `cp --no-dereference' is
	no longer equivalent to `cp -d'.
	`cp -d' is equivalent to `--no-dereference --preserve=links'.
	cp's -P option means --no-dereference, not --parents.
	Describe new optional argument to --preserve.
	Describe new option: --no-preserve=ATTRIBUTE_LIST.

2001-09-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (check-texinfo): Redirect stderr of `grep -w' to
	/dev/null, so people with old versions of grep don't see the failure.

2001-09-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (mv invocation): Describe new option:
	--reply={yes,no,query}.  Fix a few typos.

2001-09-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	be sorted.  Try to clarify -d versus -D versus -u.

2001-09-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	From Herbert Xu.

2001-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi (join invocation): Describe the GNU
	extension to join, which does not require sorted input when
	the input contains no unpairable lines.

2001-09-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi:
	New 'uname' options -i or --hardware-platform,
	and -o or --operating-system.
	'uname -a' now outputs -i and -o information at the end.
	New uname option --kernel-version is an alias for -v.
	Uname option --release has been renamed to --kernel-release,
	and --sysname has been renamed to --kernel-name;
	the old options will work for a while, but are no longer documented.

2001-08-24  Herbert Xu  <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>

	* coreutils.texi: Likewise.

	* coreutils.texi: New, renamed from omni-utils.texi.
	* omni-utils.texi: Removed, renamed to coreutils.texi.
