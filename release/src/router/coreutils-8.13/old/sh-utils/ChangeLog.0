Sat Nov 05 08:35:25 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.12.

Fri Nov 04 06:01:00 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.11.

Wed Nov 02 18:52:20 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* doc/Makefile.in (install): Remove test for existence of info
	file.  Simply change to $(srcdir) instead.

Wed Oct 26 23:40:07 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* safe-xstat.hin [EINTR]: Always define safe_l?stat.
	Define it __static -- which is `static' for most includers,
	but `/* empty */' for safe-xstat.cin.
	* safe-xstat.cin: Define __static to nothing so we get public
	safe_l?stat functions in the library.

	* Makefile.in (All actions invoking $(MAKE) from within compound
	(e.g. `for') sh statements): Exit non-zero if the sub-make fails.
	Otherwise, the top-level make may exit successfully when it should
	fail.  From Jim Kingdon (kingdon@cygnus.com).

Sun Oct 23 23:36:26 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* safe-xstat.hin: Don't use a statement expression here.
	Use an inline function instead.
	* safe-xstat.cin: Don't duplicate the definition of safe_l?stat here.
	Get the definition from safe-xstat.hin.

Fri Oct 21 00:57:23 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* man/Makefile.in: Fix typo that had su.1 being installed as
	`man/man1/.1'.  From Kjetil Torgrim Homme.

	* basename.c, dirname.c, expr.c, pathchk.c, sleep.c (main): Diagnose
	wrong number of argument -- usually too few -- instead of just
	referring the user to the --help option.  Reported by Karl Berry.

Mon Oct 17 23:55:41 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* doc/Makefile.in (install): Install the info files from either
	the source directory or the object directory.
	From Ian Lance Taylor (ian@cygnus.com).

Sun Oct 16 12:14:02 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* lib/Makefile.in (distclean): Don't delete getdate.c and posixtm.c
	here since they are not distributed.
	(realclean): Delete them here instead.
	From Francois Pinard.

Mon Oct 10 21:44:42 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* id.c (print_group_list, print_full_info): Use more precise
	feature tests.  Rather than assuming that a definition for
	NGROUPS_MAX implies the existence of the getgroups function,
	test for HAVE_GETGROUPS explicitly.
	* su.c (log_su): Likewise.  Similarly, check HAVE_INITGROUPS.
	Both from Kaveh Ghazi.  He reported that a Pyramid 9820 OSx 5.0d
	(Dual universe SVR3/BSD4.2) system had NGROUPS_MAX and syslog.h
	but not getgroups, initgroups or the syslog functions.

Fri Oct 07 19:42:35 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* doc/Makefile.in (sh-utils.dvi): Depend on version.texi.
	* version.texi: Use RELEASEDATE, not RELEASE_DATE.
	* sh-utils.texi: Likewise.

	* configure.in: Test for crypt in -lcrypt for NetBSD.
	Reported by Greg Hudson (ghudson@mit.edu).

	* system.h: Don't define lstat.  safe-l?stat.h does that now.

Thu Oct 06 21:14:07 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/Makefile.in (link_command): Remove $(CFLAGS).  Because
	the default value usually includes -g, Linux users were getting
	statically linked executables.  With this removal they'll get
	much smaller, dynamically linked ones by default.

	* lib/Makefile.in (safe-lstat.o): Depend on safe-stat.h, too.

Sun Oct 02 16:15:32 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/Makefile.in: Don't use binprefix.  Use autoconf-2's
	@program_transform_name@ instead.
	* man/Makefile.in: Likewise for manprefix.

	* safe-xstat.hin [!S_ISLNK]: Include safe-stat.h and define
	SAFE_LSTAT and safe_lstat to their symlink-ignorant counterparts.
	* lib/Makefile.in (extract_lstat, extract_stat): Add sed rules to
	extract the new cpp directives into safe-lstat.h, but not into
	safe-stat.h.

Sat Oct 01 00:14:10 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* system.h: Remove conditional definition of mode_t.
	configure takes care of this now.

	* configure.in: Add -l$lib (not $lib) to LIBS when checking
	for syslog.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* date.c (batch_convert): Use K&R style function definition.
	From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* date.c (main): When reading dates from a file with a +FORMAT-style
	user-specified format, don't print the leading `+'.  Franc,ois Pinard
	noticed this problem.
	Make an error message clearer.  From Franc,ois.

	* lib/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add getline.h.
	(SOURCES, OBJECTS): Add getline.c, getline.o.

	* safe-xstat.hin: Don't include <sys/types.h> or <sys/stat.h>.
	Otherwise, we'd lose when the includer has already included
	<sys/stat.h> on systems that aren't protected against multiple
	inclusion.  Add a note that those headers must be included before
	this one.  Don't include <config.h> either.
	* safe-xstat.cin: Include <sys/types.h> and <sys/stat.h> here instead.
	Include <config.h> here, too.
	Kaveh Ghazi reported this problem.

Fri Sep 30 22:40:21 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* date.c (main): Accept new option: (-f) --file=datefile.
	(batch_convert): New function.  Suggested by Karl Berry.

	* date.c (main): Diagnose use of conflicting options.
	Revamp non-option argument processing.
	Detect write errors.

	* lib/*.c, src/*.c: Remove CONFIG_BROKETS conditional.
	* lib/Makefile.in src/Makefile.in: Don't define it.

	configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add getcwd.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* safe-xstat.c.in, safe-xstat.h.in: Rename to safe-xstat.cin and
	safe-xstat.hin so the names don't exceed the 14-character limit.
	Reported by Kaveh Ghazi.

Mon Sep 26 19:49:40 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Don't use $su_cv_sys_tiocgwinsz_in_termios_h
	uninitialized.  From R. Bernstein <rocky@panix.com> and Kaveh Ghazi.
	(NICE_PRIORITY): Fix typo that caused omission from PROGS of nice
	and nohup on systems with nice but not setpriority.
	From Andreas Schwab.

Sat Sep 24 10:13:00 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (stamp-h.in): Create using echo, not date.
	Using the latter could easily lead to rcs/cvs merge conflicts.
	* configure.in (stamp-h): Ditto, though this is less important
	because stamp-h isn't distributed.

	* nice.c (main): Revamp option processing to detect options
	like `--7' manually and pass the rest off to getopt_long.
	(isinteger): Use ISDIGIT.
	Use parse_long_options.

	* system.h: Include <ctype.h> and add IS* macros.
	* expr.c: Don't include <ctype.h> or define IS* macros since
	system.h now does that.
	* printf.c: Ditto.

	* date.c (usage): Add description of numeric modifiers.

	* printf.c (print_formatted): Declare DIREC_LENGTH size_t, not int.
	(print_esc_string): Ditto for LENGTH.
	* dirname.c (main): Cast string literal to (char*).
	* stty.c (wrapf): Declare first argument const char *.
	* tee.c (main, tee): More const dcls and casting.
	* who.c (read_utmp): New variable: size to avoid type warnings.
	All of these eliminate compilation warnings reported by
	Franc,ois Pinard.

	* doc/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add version.texi because generating
	that file now depends on having a version of date that can handle
	formats like `+%Y %B'.
	(version.texi): Generate RELEASE_DATE, too.
	* sh-utils.texi: Use RELEASE_DATE instead of hard-coded date.

	* long-options.h: Prepend underscores to arg names in prototype
	to avoid warnings about shadowing.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add dependencies on long-options.h.

	* configure.in: Make having autoconf-1.120 a prerequisite.

	* sh-utils.texi [INFO-DIR-ENTRY]: Add an entry for each `invoking'
	node.  Regularize punctuation, indexing, and xrefs.
	From Franc,ois Pinard.

	* date.c (usage): Tweak the usage message a little.
	Add `const' to more dcls.

	* stty.c: Add `const' to more dcls.
	* su.c: Ditto.
	* who.c: Ditto.

	* tee.c (main): Use _POSIX_SOURCE, not _POSIX_VERSION.

Sat Sep 17 15:48:10 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* (doc): New subdirectory with texinfo documentation.
	Thanks to Franc,ois Pinard and Karl Berry!
	Note however that it contains mainly the information from the
	`man' pages, so it is not good documentation.  But this way,
	at least we don't have to maintain the troff man pages anymore.

	* su.c: Test !HAVE_ENDGRENT and !HAVE_ENDPWENT rather than
	_POSIX_SOURCE to determine whether endgrent and endpwent should
	be defined away.
	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add endgrent and endpwent.

	* who.c: Test HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H rather than _POSIX_SOURCE
	to determine whether <sys/param.h> should be included.

	* date.c (main): Rewrite command-line argument handling code
	to give diagnostics for inconsistent options.

	* Makefile.in: Restructure dependencies using local-*
	and recursive-* targets to avoid evil double-colon rules.
	Although the actions assiciated with double-colon rules are
	run sequentially using GNU make-3.71, POSIX doesn't guarantee
	that behavior.	The next release may run them in parallel.
	Running the old rules in parallel would sometimes delete
	config.status before it was used in a subdirectory make.
	With several suggestions from Franc,ois Pinard.

Thu Sep 15 19:10:51 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c [VWERSE && !VWERASE]: Define VWERASE for AIX-3.2.5.

Sat Sep 03 00:41:53 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* lib/Makefile.in (safe-lstat.c, safe-lstat.h, safe-stat.c,
	safe-stat.h): Use $(srcdir) to find source files.
	(.c.o): Use -I. to get safe-lstat.h and safe-stat.h from the
	build directory.
	* src/Makefile.in (incl): Add -I../lib to get lib/safe-lstat.h and
	lib/safe-stat.h from the build directory.  From Michael I Bushnell
	<mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>.

	* Makefile.in: Remove rules to create installation directories.
	* {src,man}/Makefile.in: Put them here instead.

	* configure.in: Update to take advantage of autoconf 2.0 features.

Sat Aug 27 16:57:20 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* system.h [BROKEN_STAT_MACROS]: Remove unnecessary #ifdef's.
	From Francois Pinard.

Thu Aug 18 11:44:48 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* su.1: Explain why GNU doesn't support the `wheel group'.

Mon Aug 01 21:58:14 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* date.c: Add --utc option.  It will supercede --uct.
	Change references to `universal coordinated time' to
	correct `coordinated universal time'.  From Harris Boldt Edelman
	<hbe@red-eft.la.ca.us>.
	* date.1: Correct the documentation, too.

	* date.c (main, show_date): For -u, use gmtime instead of relying on
	localtime's ability to interpret the TZ enviroment variable.
	`date -u' failed (by reporting local time) on romp-ibm-bsd and PCs
	(DOS and OS/2) running emx 0.8h.  From R. Bernstein
	<rocky@watson.ibm.com>.

Sat Jul 30 07:52:27 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* nohup.sh: Separate `nice -5' from COMMAND with `--' to ensure
	that COMMAND isn't interpreted as an option to nice.
	* groups.sh: Similarly, separate each name from `id -Gn' with `--'.
	Karl Berry pointed out that `groups --help user' gave confusing
	diagnostics.

Tue Jul 26 11:33:53 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* su.c (main): Make copies of the password information we'll use
	so that log_su (through getlogin) doesn't clobber the static data.
	With suggestions from Francois Pinard.

	* system.h: Remove `|| defined(_POSIX_VERSION)' from test that
	decides whether to include <fcntl.h>.  From Francois Pinard.

Mon Jul 25 23:54:36 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* pathchk.c (dir_ok): Use SAFE_STAT.
	* test.c (test_stat, binary_operator, unary_operator): Use SAFE_STAT
	and SAFE_LSTAT.
	* who.c (print_entry):  Use SAFE_STAT.

	* test.c (group_member): Remove function.  Use the one broken out
	into group-member.c instead.

Fri Jul 15 00:23:17 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	system.h: Remove unneeded decls of atof and atol.

Fri Jul 08 01:09:23 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	stty.c (main): Initialize max_col (used by wrapf) before calling
	display_speed.  Otherwise, `stty speed' output a spurious newline.
	From Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

Sun Jul 03 08:44:00 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in [AC_HAVE_HEADERS]: Add sys/param.h, for
	definition of HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H, now tested in pathmax.h.

	* configure.in [AC_WORDS_BIGENDIAN]: Add it.  This macro is
	required by memcmp.c on big-endian systems.  Its absence was
	diagnosed by Lars Duening (duening@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de).

Sun Jun 19 00:18:06 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* nice.c (main): Accept options like `--5' (equivalent to `-n -5')
	instead of letting getopt give an `unrecognized option' error.

	* long-options.c: Require another argument: version_string.
	Don't include "version.h" or "system.h".
	* basename.c, dirname.c, echo.c, expr.c, hostname.c, printf.c,
	pwd.c, stty.c, test.c, yes.c: Adjust callers of parse_long_options
	accordingly.

Thu Jun 02 14:11:31 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c (main): Set max_col and current_col before running
	display_window_size.  Otherwise, `stty size' output a spurious
	newline.  From Bauke Jan Douma (bjdouma@xs4all.hacktic.nl).

Mon May 30 09:33:53 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* test.c (test_syntax_error, beyond): Add __attribute__ ((noreturn))
	so gcc will know enough not to give warnings.

Sun May 29 17:40:21 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* long-options.c: Move from src/ to lib/.
	* long-options.h: Ditto.
	* src/Makefile.in: Remove references to long-options.[ch].
	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): Add long-options.[co].

Fri May 27 18:20:18 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c [VFLUSH && !VFLUSHO]: Define VFLUSH0.
	Ultrix's termios.h defines VFLUSH, but not VFLUSHO.
	From Kjetil Torgrim Homme <kjetilho@ifi.uio.no>.

Thu May 26 08:46:32 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in [INSTALL]: Revert change of March 8.  autoconf
	has fixed this.

Thu May 19 01:10:20 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.10.

	* lib/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add getdate.c and posixtm.c.

	* src/Makefile.in (users.c): Use cp if hard link fails.
	From Ian Lance Taylor.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Change package name from shellutils to sh-utils.
	That allows a hyphen and 5-character version number without exceeding
	the 14-character limit on file name length.  shellutils-1.10 would
	have been too long.
	* version.c: Update package name.

	* hostname.c: Include <sys/types.h> before "system.h".
	From Kaveh Ghazi and Karl Berry.

	* hostname.c (sethostname) [!HAVE_SETHOSTNAME && HAVE_SYSINFO &&
	HAVE_SYS_SYSTEMINFO_H && HAVE_LIMITS_H]: New function.  SVR4 systems
	prefer sysinfo over sethostname.
	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_FUNCS): Add sysinfo.
	(AC_HAVE_HEADERS): Add sys/systeminfo.h.
	From Kaveh Ghazi.

Fri May 13 09:45:23 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* lib/xgethostname.c (xgethostname): Call xmalloc outside the loop.
	Correct loop termination condition.

	* pwd.c: Include <sys/types.h> before "system.h".
	From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* {lib,man,src}/Makefile.in (Makefile): Use ../config.status
	instead of $(srcdir)/../config.status.  The latter didn't work
	for builddir != srcdir.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Remove dependencies on */Makefile.in.
	Change the rule so running config.status creates only Makefile.
	(stamp-config): Have config.status generate only config.h.

	* {lib,man,src}/Makefile.in (Makefile): Add single dependency on
	Makefile.in and rule to make config.status create only Makefile.

	* hostname.c: New program.
	* hostname.1: New file.
	* Makefile.in (PROGS): Add hostname.
	(SOURCES): Add hostname.c
	* src/Makefile.in: Add rules and dependencies for hostname.
	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_FUNCS): Add sethostname.

	* pathchk.c (validate_path) [lint]: Initialize a variable to
	suppress `used before initialized' warning.

	* who.c: Correct gethostname prototype to indicate the function
	returns int, not char.

Sun May 01 08:38:18 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* who.c: Add #ifdefs to build the `users' executable.
	* src/Makefile.in: Add corresponding rules.
	* Makefile.in (PROGS): Add users.
	From Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@noc.rutgers.edu>.
	* users.1: Document it.

Thu Apr 28 00:45:02 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* pwd.c: New program.
	* pwd.1: New file.
	* Makefile.in (PROGS): Add pwd.
	* lib/Makefile.in: (DISTFILES): Add pathmax.h.
	(SOURCES, OBJECTS): Add xgetcwd.c and xgetcwd.o respectively.
	* src/Makefile.in: Add rules and dependencies for pwd.

	* yes.c: Don't include version.h.

Mon Apr 18 19:54:24 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* documentation: Change uses of `pathname' and `path' as per
	GNU standards.

	* long-options.c (parse-long-options): Take a new argument,
	command_name, for use in --version output.
	* basename.c, dirname.c, echo.c, expr.c, printf.c, stty.c, test.c,
	yes.c (main): Update callers.

Wed Mar 30 08:53:21 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Use AC_SET_MAKE.
	* Makefile.in: Edit MAKE assignments into @SET_MAKE@.

Fri Mar 25 01:13:42 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Use AC_VERBOSE, AC_CHECKING, and AC_WARN instead
	of explicit echo commands.
	When checking for shadow password routines, make sure the function
	getspnam is available before defining HAVE_SHADOW_H.
	<dvldbg@cs.umu.se> reported that shadow.h exists on some
	linux system that did not have the function.

Tue Mar  8 10:29:13 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in [INSTALL]: When AC_PROG_INSTALL resorts to setting
	this to `./install.sh', make it `../install.sh' instead since that
	script will be invoked only from subdirectories.
	[WINSIZE_IN_PTEM]: Check for this unconditionally, rather than
	only when TIOCGWINSZ is not defined through termios.h.  The old
	method loses on SCO ODT 3.0 systems.

Sat Feb 19 14:23:14 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.9.4.

	* stty.c (main): Use getopt_long_only with "ag" instead of
	getopt_long with "".  The latter incremented optind so the
	-a and -g options weren't recognized.

	* Version 1.9.3.

Tue Feb 15 18:28:28 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c (main): Use getopt only to recognize long options.
	Hand code the loop to detect -a, -g, -ag and -ga.  Using getopt
	to detect the short options loses (because we have to ignore
	unrecognized options and we are allowing GNU getopt to permute)
	because e.g. `-tabs' is interpreted as a group of options, one of
	which is `-a'.  Before, running `stty -tabs echo' gave this error:
	  stty: when specifying an output style, modes may not be set
	Reported by Arne H. Juul.

Sun Feb 13 13:34:25 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* basename.1, dirname.1, stty.1: Reflect usage changes.
	* basename.c, dirname.c, stty.c (usage): Ditto.

	* long-options.h (parse_long_options): Invoke usage function
	argument with explicit dereference as per GNU coding standards.

	* basename.c dirname.c: Use parse_long_options instead of the
	conventional getopt_long paradigm.  Before, the commands
	`basename file-dist -dist' and `basename -- file.c .c' produced
	incorrect results.  Now, even `basename -file-dist -dist' works
	and the command `basename -- file.c .c' fails for the right
	reason: the `--' is not a special (to getopt) token for these
	commands.  It is interpreted as the filename, so there are too
	many arguments to basename.  Rick Sladkey <jrs@world.std.com>
	reported the problem with basename.

	* stty.c (set_window_size): When stty fails to get the window size
	(as happens on telnet sessions to Solaris systems), initialize all
	fields of the winsize struct.  Before, it was using the uninitialized
	pixel fields of the struct in the ioctl to set window size parameters.
	From Rick Sladkey.

	* stty.c (main): Use parse_long_options to handle --help and --version.
	(main): In the remaining getopt_long loop, don't jump out of the
	loop from the `default' branch of the switch statement.  Doing that
	left optind in an inconsistent when there were non-option arguments
	preceding `reversed' arguments (e.g. stty echo -echoe) and the
	preceding non-option arguments were ignored.  Rick Sladkey reported
	that stty was ignoring arguments.

	* stty.c (main): Fail with a diagnostic when both -g and -a are given.
	(main): Fail with a diagnostic when either -g or -a is used with
	arguments for setting modes.

Fri Feb 11 19:39:37 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c (get_win_size): Don't use an ANSI-style function
	definition.  From Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@noc.rutgers.edu>.

Thu Feb 10 01:22:37 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c [CSWTCH] (__sparc__ && __svr4__): Define `swtch' to
	_POSIX_VDISABLE by default.  Otherwise, the default settings on
	SunOS 5.3 (from /usr/include/sys/termios.h) have both `swtch'
	and `susp' set to ^Z.  Those default settings are not unusual.
	What is unusual is that with such settings on SunOS 5.3, the tty
	driver doesn't generate a signal for control-Z.  Reported by
	Brent Wiese <brent@dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu>.

	* stty.c (main) [CIBAUD]: Don't report an error on SunOS 4.1.x
	systems if the only difference is in this nybble of c_cflag.
	See the comments for the gory details.  Thanks to
	Erez "HWank1" Zadok <ezk@cs.columbia.edu> for reporting this
	and helping me reproduce it.

Tue Feb 01 00:59:56 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c (main): Call tcsetattr only if we've updated tty modes,
	not e.g. if we've changed the window size.

	* Update Copyright dates in src/*.

Fri Jan 28 11:02:21 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Don't set LDFLAGS since linking now uses both
	LDFLAGS and CFLAGS.

Wed Jan 26 10:54:02 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c (get_win_size): New function.  Try getting size first
	for the device on stdout.  Try stdin only if that fails.  Suggested
	by Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.
	(set_win_size): Call get_win_size instead of calling ioctl directly.
	(display_window_size): Ditto.
	(screen_columns): Ditto.

Mon Jan 24 22:57:18 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c (set_window_size): Work around SunOS 4.x kernel bug that
	makes `stty rows 34 cols 80;stty rows 0;stty cols 0' incorrectly
	set rows to 80 and columns to 0.  Sun's stty has this problem, too.
	The kernel bug is fixed in Solaris 2.  Mostly from Alexander Dupuy
	<dupuy@cs.columbia.edu>.

	* src/Makefile.in: Use both LDFLAGS and CFLAGS when linking.
	* man/Makefile.in: Use binprefix as the default manprefix.

	* nohup.sh: Redirect usage message to stderr.
	From Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

Thu Jan 13 17:27:38 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/Makefile.in: Change all link commands to use both $(CFLAGS)
	and $(LDFLAGS).

Mon Jan 10 01:20:38 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* man/Makefile.in (manprefix): Use binprefix as the default.

Thu Jan 06 18:19:06 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* who.c (print_entry): Prepend `/dev/' only if ut_line is not
	already an absolute filename.  Just to be safe.

Fri Dec 31 00:22:59 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* date.c (usage): Reorder listing of % formats in `sort -f' order.

Tue Dec 28 15:49:32 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* install.sh: New file.
	Makefile.in [DISTFILES]: Add it.

	* who.c (read_utmp): Use stdio functions instead of open/read/close
	to avoid having to handle POSIX read's -1/errno=EINTR failure case.

	* tee.c (tee): A POSIX implementation of the read system call
	may return -1 and set errno to EINTR when it is interrupted.
	Retry instead of failing with an error.
	(tee): Don't use xwrite.  Use full_write instead and include the
	losing file name in the message reporting a write failure.
	Don't treat standard output as a special case, so a failed write
	to stdout doesn't exit immediately.

	* date.c (usage): Note that for %w, 0 corresponds to Sunday.

Sat Dec 25 23:15:58 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* who.c (main): Don't chdir ("/dev") for the stat in print_entry.
	(print_entry): Instead of stat'ing the /dev-relative path, ut_line,
	stat the absolute path with "/dev/" prefix.  From David MacKenzie.

Wed Dec 22 00:53:51 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* expr.c (toarith): Interpret the empty string as just that
	rather than as the integer zero.
	Before, `expr "" == 0' output 1.  Now it prints 0.

	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_HEADERS): Check for float.h for strtod.c.

	* configure.in (check for TIOCGWINSZ): Don't look in sys/ioctl.h
	or sys/ptem.h if we've already found it in termios.h.  This
	eliminates redefinition warnings from including both termios.h
	and sys/ioctl.h on sytems running SunOS.  From Matthew Seaman
	(matthew@dyson.ox.ac.uk).

	* date.1: Document new %s format and old `-' and `_' numeric field
	modifiers.

	* memcmp.c: Use the latest version from GNU C library.

Mon Dec 20 23:29:30 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in [test for 8-bit clean memcmp]: Add a test to detect
	losing memcmp from SunOS4.1.x.  From Robert H. de Vries
	<robert@and.nl>.

Sat Dec 18 01:12:24 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Put `touch stamp-config' in second arg
	so it goes in config.status.  This eliminates unnecessary second run
	of configure.

Fri Dec 10 01:06:28 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c (screen_columns): Instead of dying just because Solaris'
	`ioctl (0, TIOCGWINSZ' fails (strangely only for telnet sessions,
	not rlogin sessions), ignore its errno == EINVAL and try to get
	the number of columns another way.

	* stty.c (set_window_size): If ioctl to get window size fails,
	(as on telnet sessions to Solaris 2.[12] systems) try to set the
	requested fields anyway, setting to zero any unspecified fields.
	This is what Sun's /bin/stty appears to do.
	* (display_window_size): Don't display anything for the number
	of rows and columns if the ioctl call intended to get them fails.

Tue Nov 30 23:58:54 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.9.2.

Mon Nov 29 00:28:35 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c, configure.in, acconfig.h: Revert change of Nov 26.
	I am no longer able to reproduce the behavior that prompted
	that patch -- but I had tested only using an old version of gcc.
	When building with a more recent version of gcc or with /bin/cc
	there is no problem.

Sat Nov 27 15:11:21 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* nice.c (main): If an adjustment is specified, but no command is
	given, give a diagnostic in addition to the usage message.
	(isinteger): Accept a leading `+'.

Fri Nov 26 18:49:42 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* stty.c [GWINSZ_BROKEN]: Define TIOCGWINSZ to TCGETS for Solaris-2.2.
	On that system, ioctl (0, TIOCGWINSZ, &win) always fails, but using
	TCGETS works.  Reported by Francois Pinard.

	* configure.in [GWINSZ_BROKEN]: New test to detect Solaris' inability
	to get window size from ioctl using TIOCGWINSZ.
	* acconfig.h [GWINSZ_BROKEN]: Add an #undef.

Mon Nov 22 23:40:21 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* who.c [defined (UTMPX_FILE)]: (undef and) define UTMP_FILE to
	this value even if UTMP_FILE is already defined.  Because some
	systems define both symbols.  From Arne H. Juul.
	* [MESG_BIT]: Rename to S_IWGRP (from sys/stat.h>) and define only
	if not already defined.

Fri Nov 19 23:08:03 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* who.c (print_entry): Produce reasonably formatted output even when
	sizeof (this->ut_name,ut_line) are much larger than 8.  For Solaris
	and other SysVr4.  With help from Arne H. Juul.
	* configure.in (HAVE_UTMPX_H): New test; combined with test for the
	ut_host field.  From Arne H. Juul.

	* memcmp.c: New file.
	* lib/Makefile.in [SOURCES]: Add memcmp.c.
	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add memcmp.
	Add test for 8-bit clean memcmp.

	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_FUNCS): Add isascii.
	* expr.c [!defined (isascii) || defined (STDC_HEADERS)]: This failed
	on AIX PS/2 1.3 systems because isascii is a function and it is used
	in definitions (with the necessary side effect of assigning to a
	global variable) of the is* macros.  Also test HAVE_ISASCII and
	redefine ISASCII(c) instead of isascii.
	Reported by Minh Tran-Le (tranle@intellicorp.com).
	* printf.c: Ditto.

	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_HEADERS): Add sys/timeb.h; getdate.y tests
	HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H.

	* stty.c (main): Detect the case in which POSIX-conformant tcsetattr
	fails and still returns zero.

Wed Nov 17 21:05:10 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* yes.c (main): Complete my half-finished Nov 2 change.
	yes with arguments did not print newlines.  From Andreas Schwab
	(ls5.informatik.uni-dortmund.de).

	* stty.c (wrapf): Fix off-by-one error that could make `stty -a'
	output lines one character too long.  From Andreas Schwab.

Sat Nov 13 00:11:19 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.9.1.

	* configure.in [LIBS]: Add -lbsd if that is necessary to get the
	syslog function.  With help from Kaveh Ghazi.

	* configure.in [LIBS]: Reorganize/unify the code that adds libraries
	solely to resolve syslog.  Add a library only if it is required to
	resolve the syslog reference.

	* configure.in [AC_HAVE_HEADERS]: Check for sys/timeb.h.
	getdate.y needs to know.
	[LIBS]: Check for initgroups in -los.  This is required by SCO-ODT-3.0
	when linking su.
	[LIBS]: Check -lufc for crypt.
	Reported by Steven W Orr (steveo@world.std.com).

Thu Nov 11 23:55:48 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* id.c [NGROUPS_MAX]: Undefine before redefining.
	From Kaveh R. Ghazi (ghazi@noc.rutgers.edu).

	* who.c (list_entries): Trim any trailing blanks from ut_name
	and make sure the string is NUL-terminated before printing it.
	Before, `who -q' displayed 8-character names with a tty
	(e.g. `q1') suffix.

	* stty.c [CFLUSHO]: Move this definition so it follows the
	one for VFLUSHO.

Mon Nov 08 23:16:36 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.9.

	* su.c (correct_password): Report an error and fail if getpass
	returns NULL.

Tue Nov 02 01:14:21 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* acconfig.h: Add comments.

	* printenv.c (main): Exit with status == 2 for file error.

	* yes.c (main): Restore argv/optind handling -- now that
	parse_long_options doesn't change optind.

Mon Oct 25 19:22:58 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* basename.c, date.c, dirname.c, echo.c, env.c, expr.c, id.c,
	logname.c, nice.c, pathchk.c, printenv.c, printf.c, sleep.c,
	stty.c, su.c, tee.c, test.c, tty.c, uname.c, who.c, whoami.c,
	yes.c: Use the preferred `--longopt=arg' syntax in --help message
	rather than `--longopt arg'.  From Francois Pinard.

	* stty.c (main, integer_arg): Don't just call error(1,... about
	improper usage.  Call `error (0,...' then usage (1).

Sun Oct 24 14:10:23 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* test.c [member]: Don't try to cast index return value to an int.
	That can lose on systems with 64-bit pointers.

	* long-options.c: Save and restore optind, too.
	* long-options.h: New file.
	* long-options.c, echo.c, expr.c, printf.c, test.c, yes.c:
	Include it instead of duplicating dcls.
	* src/Makefile.in: Add dependencies for it.

Tue Oct 19 00:26:27 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* expr.c [!__STDC__]: Don't define away `const'.  configure alone
	decides whether to do that.  From Francois Pinard.

Sat Oct 16 22:32:54 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* whoami.c (main): Cast printf arg UID so it matches the type
	expected by %u format no matter how uid_t is defined.

	* stty.c: Accept `status' option and VDISCARD as an alias for
	VFLUSHO.  From Arne H. Juul (arnej@imf.unit.no).

	* basename.c, date.c, dirname.c, echo.c, env.c, expr.c,
	false.sh, groups.sh, id.c, logname.c, long-options.c, nice.c,
	nohup.sh, pathchk.c, printenv.c, printf.c, sleep.c, stty.c,
	su.c, tee.c, test.c, true.sh, tty.c, uname.c, who.c, whoami.c,
	yes.c: Using --help gets long well- formatted help.  Now --help
	writes to stdout and exits successfully.  From Francois Pinard
	<pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

Wed Oct 13 13:10:27 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* long-options.c: Include sys/types before system.h.

	* src/Makefile.in (false, groups, nohup, true): Substitute the string
	from version.c for @VERSION@ in *.sh.

Sat Oct  9 23:12:53 1993  Jim Meyering  meyering@comco.com

	* configure.in: Remove AC_UNISTD_H; add unistd.h to AC_HAVE_HEADERS.

Tue Oct  5 22:18:05 1993  Jim Meyering  meyering@comco.com

	* tty.c (main): Detect write error.  Use isatty (rather than
	testing whether ttyname() is NULL) to determine exit status
	because ttyname may return NULL when stdin is a terminal device.

	* expr.c (eval7): Rewrite if-else-if-else... sequence to avoid a
	spurious `function returns without a value' warning.

	* printenv.c (main), tty.c (main): Detect and report write errors.

	* echo.c, patchchk.c, printenv.c, printf.c, sleep.c, stty.c, su.c,
	tee.c, test.c, tty.c, uname.c, yes.c: Accept --help and --version

	yes accept --help and --version as unobtrusively as possible.
	* src/Makefile.in [SORUCES]: Add it.

	* configure.in: Add AC_TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME and AC_STAT_MACROS_BROKEN.

	* nice.c (main) [NICE_PRIORITY]: When given an argument, don't
	try to get current priority.  nice() requires only the delta;
	we don't need to compute the absolute priority as for setpriority.

Mon Oct 04 22:15:07 1993  Jim Meyering (meyering@comco.com)

	* who.c (print_entry, print_heading, who_am_i):
	Cast printf field width arguments to int to avoid warnings.
	(idle_string): Cast idle seconds and minutes to int.

	Don't declare ttyname as static.

	* echo.c (just_echo): Use putchar instead of printf.

	* expr.c (parse_long_options): New function.
	(main): Use it to handle --version and --help properly.

	* tee.c (main): Put entire #ifdef inside if-braces to make structure
	clearer.
	(main, tee): Compare close() != 0 rather than close () == -1.

	* pathchk.c (portable_chars_only, dir_ok): Make a couple variables
	const.

Wed Sep 08 00:07:36 1993  Jim Meyering (meyering@comco.com)

	* test.c [advance, unary_advance]: Rewrite using do{...}while(0)
	paradigm instead of comma expressions that make Alpha OSFv1.3
	C compiler segfault.

	* basename.c, date.c, dirname.c, env.c, id.c, logname.c, nice.c:
	Add --help and --version options.

Sat Jul 24 08:52:18 1993  Jim Meyering (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Check for -lshadow.  Linux needs it when using shadow
	passwords.  Reported by Mattias Olofsson <mattias@lysator.liu.se>.

Thu May 27 20:05:50 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in (c_line test): Add missing `fi'.

Tue May 18 23:49:26 1993  Jim Meyering (meyering@comco.com)

	* mkinstalldirs: New file.
	* Makefile.in (installdirs): Use it.

Thu May 13 01:03:16 1993  Jim Meyering (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (installdirs): New rules for creating installation
	directories. (install): depend on it.

Mon May  3 22:09:24 1993  Jim Meyering (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Add AC_GETGROUPS_T.
	* id.c, test.c: Don't define GETGROUPS_T.  Now configure does it.

Sun May  2 00:21:05 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* expr.c (eval6): Terminate result with a zero byte.
	The command `expr substr xx 1 2' would fail on systems with
	tight malloc.  From Steve James <smj@cats.COM>.

	* expr.c (null): Recognize the string `0' as zero.
	(divide, mod): Upon request to divide by zero, give an error
	message instead of dumping core.
	From J.T. Conklin <jtc@wimsey.com>.

	* configure.in: Check for sys/time.h; getdate.y needs it for
	structs timeval and timezone on some systems.
	* Check for gettimeofday and for `struct tm'.
	* Add existence tests for memcpy and bcopy.

	* configure.in: Find a parser generator.

	* putenv.c: Include stdlib.h only if __GNU_LIBRARY__ is defined.
	Many vendor-supplied <stdlib.h> have a declaration of putenv that
	conflicts with ours.

Tue Apr 20 02:33:24 1993  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@kropotkin.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* stty.c: Use GWINSZ_IN_SYS_IOCTL, not _AIX, to determine

Tue Nov 24 09:46:02 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* echo.c: Use V9_DEFAULT instead of USG.  Define it always.

	they might make a path invalid.
	(portable_chars_only, dir_ok): New functions.
	(validate_path): Renamed from validate_new_path.
	Call them.  Don't complain if a leading
	dir doesn't exist.  Don't replace `parent' with a dir that

	from pathconf to constant values.

	* who.c [!UTMP_FILE]: If _PATH_UTMP is defined, use it instead
	of /etc/utmp.  From Marc Boucher <marc@cam.org>.
