 [2.0.15]
* date no longer accepts e.g., September 31 in the MMDDhhmm syntax
* fix a bug in this package's .m4 files and in configure.ac
 [2.0.14]
* nohup's behavior is changed as follows, to conform to POSIX 1003.1-2001:
  - nohup no longer adjusts scheduling priority; use "nice" for that.
  - nohup now redirects stderr to stdout, if stderr is not a terminal.
  - nohup exit status is now 126 if command was found but not invoked,
    127 if nohup failed or if command was not found.
 [2.0.13]
* uname and uptime work better on *BSD systems
* pathchk now exits nonzero for a path with a directory component
    that specifies a non-directory
 [2.0.12]
* kill: new program
* who accepts new options: --all (-a), --boot (-b), --dead (-d), --login,
   --process (-p), --runlevel (-r), --short (-s), --time (-t), --users (-u).
   The -u option now produces POSIX-specified results and is the same as
   the long option `--users'.  --idle is no longer the same as -u.
* The following changes apply on systems conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001,
  and are required by the new POSIX standard:
   - `date -I' is no longer supported.  Instead, use `date --iso-8601'.
   - `nice -NUM' is no longer supported.  Instead, use `nice -n NUM'.
* New 'uname' options -i or --hardware-platform, and -o or --operating-system.
   'uname -a' now outputs -i and -o information at the end.
   New uname option --kernel-version is an alias for -v.
   Uname option --release has been renamed to --kernel-release,
   and --sysname has been renamed to --kernel-name;
   the old options will work for a while, but are no longer documented.
* 'expr' now uses the LC_COLLATE locale for string comparison, as per POSIX.
* 'expr' now requires '+' rather than 'quote' to quote tokens;
    this removes an incompatibility with POSIX.
* date -d 'last friday' would print a date/time that was one hour off
    (e.g., 23:00 on *thursday* rather than 00:00 of the preceding friday)
    when run such that the current time and the target date/time fall on
    opposite sides of a daylight savings time transition.
    This problem arose only with relative date strings like `last monday'.
    It was not a problem with strings that include absolute dates.
* factor is twice as fast, for large numbers
 [2.0.11]
* setting the date now works properly, even when using -u
* `date -f - < /dev/null' no longer dumps core

 [2.0i]
* fixed a bug introduced in 2.0h that made many programs fail with a
 `write error' when invoked with the --version option
 [2.0h]
* all programs fail when printing --help or --version output to a full device
* printf exits nonzero upon write failure
* yes now detects and terminates upon write failure
* date --rfc-822 now always emits day and month names from the `C' locale
* portability tweaks for Solaris8, Ultrix, and DOS
 [2.0g]
* date now handles two-digit years with leading zeros correctly.
* printf interprets unicode, \uNNNN \UNNNNNNNN, on systems with the
  required support;  from Bruno Haible.

 [2.0f]
* fix build problems with ut_name vs. ut_user
 [2.0e]
* stty: fix long-standing bug that caused test failures on at least HPUX
  systems when COLUMNS was set to zero
* still more portability fixes
* unified lib/: now that directory and most of the configuration framework
  is common between fileutils, textutils, and sh-utils
 [2.0d]
* fix portability problem with sleep vs lib/strtod.c's requirement for -lm
 [2.0c]
* fix portability problems with nanosleep.c and with the new code in sleep.c
 [2.0b]
* Regenerate lib/Makefile.in so that nanosleep.c is distributed.
 [2.0a]
* sleep accepts floating point arguments on command line
* sleep's clock continues counting down when sleep is suspended
* when a suspended sleep process is resumed, it continues sleeping if
  there is any time remaining
* who once again prints whatever host information it has, even without --lookup
Changes in release 2.0
* disable stty tests (otherwise they fail) when `make check' is run via rsh
 [1.16m]
* false and true now ignore --help and --version when POSIXLY_CORRECT is set
 [1.16l]

* work around problems with my use of AC_SEARCH_LIBS
* fix a bug in id
 [1.16i]
* portability tweaks for lib/readutmp.[ch] and src/date.c
 [1.16h]
* seq with no arguments now elicits a useful diagnostic rather than a segfault
* portability tweaks to work around utmpname differences
* who works on Solaris
 [1.16g]
* factor now uses uintmax_t, so the largest number it can factor is now 2^64 - 1
  on systems with type `long long'.
* nohup no longer modifies the shell's search path
* `basename /' now prints `/', per the single unix spec
* `who --lookup' no longer erroneously reports `localhost' for IP addresses
  for which it could not do a reverse lookup.
* `id user' wouldn't report a group id in some situations.  Now it always does.
 [1.16f]
* chroot now calls chdir ("/") after chroot.
* `date -s' now exits with nonzero status upon failure
* new autoconf tests detect bugs in vendor mktime from Irix-6.4 and SunOS4.1.4
  Your executables will be a little larger on such systems because you'll use
  GNU's mktime function, but date will work more reliably.
* hostid: new program
* `yes --help' and `yes --version' print those strings when the POSIXLY_CORRECT
  environment variable is set
* who no longer does DNS lookups by default -- the new option, --lookup (-l),
  enables lookups
 [1.16e]
* pinky: new lightweight finger-style program
 [1.16d]
* the groups script now exits non-zero and doesn't print anything more
  when `id' fails
 [1.16c]

Changes in release 1.14
* fix bug in getdate.y that broke date's --date=DATE option on systems
  like SunOS4.
* expr treats unadorned ? and + as literals.  To make expr treat them as
  operators you have to use \? and \+.

Changes in release 1.13
* two patches for ISC
* Regenerate all Makefile.in using a patched version of automake-1.1l.
 [1.12s]
* lots of little bug fixes -- see ChangeLog
 [1.12r]

  SI_ARCHITECTURE.
* stty works better on systems like i386-pc-isc3.0
* date --date=DATE accepts dates like those in an RCS log listing, e.g.,

  of the basic regular expression is `^'
* `id user' no longer prints bogus group list
* uses automake-generated Makefile templates
* date accepts new %V format
* date's %U and %W formats work properly
* nice option handling works with 2-digit old-style-option adjustments.
  Now, `nice -18 -- nice' prints `18'.  Before it printed `8'.
* internationalized diagnostic messages

* New programs: chroot, factor, seq, uptime.
* date accepts new option: --rfc-822 (-R)
* date accepts new format, %z, for RFC-822 style numeric timezone (-0500)

  like-named touch option.
* date can now format dates up to and including ones in the year 2037
User visible changes in release 1.12
* None.
User visible changes in release 1.11
* date accepts new option: (-f) --file=DATEFILE
* skeletal texinfo documentation (mainly just the `invoking' nodes)
* `stty werase ^W' works.  Before, werase wasn't enabled for AIX-3.2.5.

  `Sun Apr  3 23:00:00 CDT 1994'.
User visible changes in release 1.9.4
* Repair stty option handling.
User visible changes in release 1.9.3
* `stty -a -g' gets a diagnostic
* `stty {-a|-g} any-other-argument' gets a diagnostic
* stty no longer ignores some of its arguments
* basename and dirname no longer treat `--' specially
* `basename -- file.c .c' generates a usage error.  Before, it output `file'.
* `basename file-dist -dist' outputs `file'.  Before it output `file-dist'.
* stty defaults `swtch' to undefined for Solaris so `susp' (^Z) will work.
  Before, with the default settings ^Z did nothing.
* stty no longer gives an error message when it finds a spurious difference
  (due to buggy tcgetattr/tcsetattr) between requested and current tty
  modes under SunOS 4.1.x.
* stty no longer fails if the ioctl to determine the display width fails
  when displaying settings.

* `expr 1 / 0' gives an error message rather than trying to divide by zero
* expr's `substr' doesn't overrun malloc'd buffer
* expr recognizes the string `0' as zero
* better support for Linux, Dec Alpha, and SGI Irix
* all programs (even true and false) accept --version and --help options
* uname's --version option is no longer equivalent to its -v option
* configure uses config.h, so DEFS won't exceed preprocessor limits of
  some compilers on the number of symbols defined via -D.

  ../config.h -- this happened only when building in a subdirectory
  and when config.h remained in $(srcdir) from a previous ./configure.
* make may be run from the subdirectories
