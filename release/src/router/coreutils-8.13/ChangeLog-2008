	On Mac OS 10.5.1 (Darwin 9.1), you'll need --disable-acl.
	(Running tests as root): Recommend using "check-root", not "check".

2008-01-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Do not define-away __attribute__ when __STRICT_ANSI__ is set.
	* src/system.h (__attribute__): Remove the __STRICT_ANSI__ disjunct.

	of no-longer-defined variable, $(LIB_ACL_TRIVIAL).

	cp (but not copy.c): plug a small leak.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy) [--parents]: Free the attribute list.

	Make a racy test failure less likely to happen.
	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Uncomment a debug "warn".
	This change happens to make this test far less likely to fail.
	With that statement commented out, this test would fail about
	20% of the time on my desktop.  Now, it's gone 100 iterations
	in a row with no failure.

	* NEWS: Mention the cp bug fix.

2008-01-07  Jan Blunck  <jblunck@suse.de>

2008-01-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	touch: ignore "-d now" option, when appropriate
	* src/touch.c (main): Treat "-d now" as if it were absent, if
