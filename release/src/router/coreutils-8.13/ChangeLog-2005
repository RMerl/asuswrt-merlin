2005-12-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_obsolete_symbols): Prohibit use of O_NDELAY.
	(sc_prohibit_assert_without_use): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it to the list.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_assert_without_use: New empty file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.

	* Makefile.maint (CVS_LIST): Define in terms of $(srcdir).

	* cp.c, df.c, link.c, mknod.c, nice.c, sleep.c, unlink.c:
	Don't include <assert.h>; it wasn't used.

2005-12-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/chown-core.c (restricted_chown):
	Don't try O_WRONLY unless O_RDONLY failed wth EACCES.
	* src/remove.c (fd_to_subdirp): Open with O_DIRECTORY | O_NOCTTY
	| O_NOFOLLOW too, for consistency with other dir-openers.
	Use POSIX-preferred O_NONBLOCK rather than O_NDELAY.
	(is_empty_dir): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (wipename): Likewise.  Don't bother trying to open
	dir for writing, since POSIX prohibits it.

2005-12-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/help-version: Redirect stderr to /dev/full, to suppress
	write error diagnostic.

2005-12-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/mkdir.c, src/mknod.c, src/mkfifo.c (main)
	Avoid a minor race condition when `-m MODE' is specified, by using
	open, fchown, and close rather than just chown.  To do that reliably --
	even with an overly restrictive umask -- ensure that each mkdir,
	mknod and mkfifo call uses a mode including at least owner-read access.
	* src/mknod.c (main): When `-m MODE' is specified, exit nonzero if
	the subsequent chown (or equivalent open,fchown,close) fails.
	* tests/misc/mknod: New tests.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add mknod.

2005-12-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Open with O_NDELAY, so we don't hang,
	e.g., on a named pipe.
	(OPEN_NO_FOLLOW_SYMLINK): Remove definition.  Use O_NOFOLLOW in
	place of all uses, since it is guaranteed (system.h) to be defined.

2005-12-05  Andreas Gruenbacher  <agruen@suse.de>

	Add POSIX ACL support
	* src/ls.c: Switch back from HAVE_ACL to USE_ACL: The acl() syscall
	is no requirement for ACL support; particularly, it does not exist
	on systems that have POSIX ACLs.
	* src/copy.h (cp_option_init) [umask_kill]: Remove member.
	* src/cp.c (umask_kill): With default acls, the umask is not to be
	applied.  Remove umask_kill, don't change the process umask, and let
	the kernel apply the umask where appropriate.
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): Fix logic for POSIX ACLs.
	* src/copy.c (get_dest_mode): Remove; it is obsolete after removing
	umask_kill.
	(copy_reg, copy_internal): Use copy_acl and set_acl
	instead of fchown/chown. Fix the logic for POSIX ACLs.
	(chown_succeded): Remove; we now always copy acls and
	preserve S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_ISVTX when needed, no matter if we
	did a chown before or not.
	* src/mv.c, src/install.c (cp_option_init): Don't set umask_kill member.
	* src/Makefile.am (dir_LDADD, ls_LDADD, vdir_LDADD, cp_LDADD,
	mv_LDADD, ginstall_LDADD): On systems with an ACL library, arrange
	to link with it via $(LIB_ACL), for the utilities that need it.

2005-12-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/remove.c (OPENAT_CWD_RESTORE__REQUIRE): Remove.
	(OPENAT_CWD_RESTORE__ALLOW_FAILURE): Likewise.
	(fd_to_subdirp): Remove openat_cwd_restore_allow_failure arg; its
	value is now signified by whether cwd_errno is null.
	(fd_to_subdirp, remove_dir, rm_1); Change cwd failure indicator from
	pointer-to-bool to pointer-to-errno-value.  All callers changed.
	(rm_1): Don't bother setting a local cwd failure flag and then
	ORing it into the caller's.  Just set the caller's.
	(rm): Use cwd failure errno value to print a slightly-better
	diagnostic.

2005-12-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (print_it): Properly handle a backslash at the
	end of a --printf format string.  Reported by Paul Eggert.
	* tests/misc/stat-printf (end-bs): Add a test for the above.

2005-12-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/acl: Port to pre-POSIX shells like Solaris 8 /bin/sh.
	Don't assume /etc/passwd contains user names; use 'id' instead.

2005-12-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	stat: revert behavior of --format=FMT (-c)
	stat: add new option: --printf=FMT
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* src/stat.c (isodigit, octtobin, hextobin): Define.
	(PRINTF_OPTION): Define.
	(interpret_backslash_escapes, trailing_delim): New globals.
	(usage): Document them.  Alphabetize on long option names.
	(print_esc_char): New function.
	(print_it): Rewrite, in order to handle backslash escapes.
	(main): Handle new option.  Set globals for --format, too.

	* tests/misc/stat-printf: Test --printf and --format.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add stat-printf.

2005-12-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: sort now reports incompatible options.
	* src/sort.c (incompatible_options, check_ordering_compatibility):
	New functions.
	(main): Use them.  Don't bother with a usage message for
	"sort -c a b", for consistency with other error diagnostics.
	* tests/sort/Test.pm (incompat1, incompat2, incompat3, incompat4):
	New tests.

	* src/cat.c (main): Undo previous change.  close_stdout already
	does the check, so the previous change wasn't necessary.

2005-12-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/cat.c (main): Check for close (STDOUT_FILENO) failure.

2005-12-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Install a more-conservative approach for sort -R.  It's the
	same basic idea as the existing code, except it uses the full ISAAC
	approach (called the "more kosher" approach in the existing comments).
	This makes "sort -R" quite a bit slower (about a factor of 2 on my
	little tests involving 10000 lines on a 2.4 GHz P4), but I think it's
	better to be conservative here at first, and review any performance
	improvements carefully.
	* .x-sc_require_config_h: Add src/rand-isaac.c.
	* src/rand-isaac.h: Remove.  All uses now simply include rand-isaac.c.
	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Remove rand-isaac.h.
	(shred_SOURCES, sort_SOURCES): Remove.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add rand-isaac.c.
	* src/rand-isaac.c: Revert to what used to be in shred.c, without
	changing it to allow for varying numbers of words in the state.
	Alter so that we include rand-isaac.c directly rather than
	compiling it and linking to it.  Don't include config.h or
	system.h; that's the includer's responsibility.
	Omit functions that are specific to shred.
	(ISAAC_LOG, ISAAC_WORDS, ISAAC_BYTES, struct isaac_state, ind):
	(isaac_step, struct irand_state):
	Resurrect these, with the same defns that used to be in shred.c.
	(ISAAC_SIZE, isaac_new, isaac_copy): Remove.
	(isaac_refill, isaac_seed_start, isaac_seed_data, irand_init, irand32):
	static again.
	(struct isaac_state, isaac_refill, isaac_mix, isaac_init):
	(isaac_seed_start, isaac_seed_data, isaac_seed_finish, isaac_seed):
	(irand_init, irand32, irand_mod):
	Number of words is constant again.
	(struct irand_state, irand_init, irand32, irand_mod): Move to shred.c.
	* src/shred.c: Include rand-isaac.c rather than rand-isaac.h.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (fillrand, dopass, main): Undo previous change.
	(struct irand_state, irand_init, irand32, irand_mod): Moved back here,
	from rand-isaac.c.
	* src/sort.c: Don't include md5.h; it wasn't needed.
	(struct keyfield): Rename random_hash to random, for consistency
	with the other member names.  All uses changed.
	(usage): Tweak wording to mention STRING for --seed option.
	(short_options): Rorder for consistency with other programs.
	(rand_state): Now a struct, not a pointer to one.  All uses changed.
	(HASH_WORDS, HASH_SIZE): Remove.
	(get_hash): Remove comments around resbuf size, since we can assume C89.
	Use a "more-kosher" (but slower) approach of invoking isaac_refill.
	(keycompare): Adjust to the new get_hash.
	Add a FIXME.
	(badfieldspec): Omit recently-introduced comment; it isn't needed.
	(main): Don't set need_random simply because gkey has it set; that
	doesn't necessarily mean we'll need random numbers.
	Redo seeding to match new get_hash approach.

2005-12-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Add rand-isaac.h.

	Avoid shred segfault on 64-bit systems.
	* src/rand-isaac.c (isaac_refill): Don't try to negate a
	local of type uint32_t.  Make the local an `int' instead.

	* NEWS: Mention sort's new options.

	* src/rand-isaac.c (isaac_mix): Declare to be static.
	Mark all other functions as `extern' so the tight-scope
	part of `make distcheck' passes once again.
	* src/rand-isaac.h (isaac_mix): Remove declaration.

	* src/sort.c (get_hash): Change position of `*' in parameter
	type to conform with convention.
	(main): Split a long line so it fits in 80 columns.
	(keycompare): Remove stray SPACE before TAB that was
	causing `make distcheck' to fail.

	* src/shred.c: Don't include gethrxtime.h.  No longer needed.

	* tests/misc/sort-rand: New file: basic tests for the new options.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add sort-rand.

2005-12-10  Frederik Eaton  <frederik@ofb.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (sort_LDADD): Add $(LIB_GETHRXTIME).
	(shred_SOURCES, sort_SOURCES): New macros, so we compile rand-isaac.c.
	* src/rand-isaac.c: New file, containing ISAAC code that was in shred.c.
	Make state size runtime-configurable.
	(isaac_new, isaac_copy): New functions.
	* src/rand-isaac.h: New file.
	* src/shred.c: Include rand-isaac.h.  Move ISAAC code to rand-isaac.c.
	(fillrand, main): Adjust to the fact that the state size is now
	runtime-configurable.
	* src/sort.c (short_options, long_options, WORDS, keycompare, main):
	(usage): Add options --random-sort and --seed to implement a random
	shuffle.
	Include md5.h and rand-isaac.h.
	(get_hash): New function.
	(rand_state): New var.
	(HASH_WORDS, HASH_SIZE): New macros.

2005-12-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/dd/misc: Add test for dd iflags=noatime.

2005-12-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (usage): Mention white space vs -b and -t options.
	From The Wanderer.

2005-12-09  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* src/test.c (main): Fix misleading comment.

2005-12-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention dd's new noatime flag.
	* src/system.h (O_NOATIME): Define to 0 if not already defined.
	* src/dd.c (flags, usage): Add support for noatime flag.

2005-12-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Distribute the cvsu script, used only by `make syntax-check'.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add build-aux/cvsu.
	* Makefile.maint (CVS_LIST): Use build-aux/cvsu, now that we
	distribute a copy of this script.
	* .x-sc_unmarked_diagnostics: Add build-aux/cvsu.

	* tests/mv/acl: exit-77 before the trap, not after, if we fail
	to create a temporary directory on another partition.
	From Andreas Gruenbacher.

2005-12-06  Tomas Pospisek  <tpo@sourcepole.ch>  (tiny change)

	* man/basename.x: Cross-reference to dirname and readlink.
	* man/dirname.x: Cross-reference to basename and readlink.

2005-12-05  Andreas Gruenbacher

	* src/copy.c [!HAVE_FCHOWN]: Define fchown(...) to -1.
	(set_owner, preserve_author): New functions, factored out of copy_reg.
	(copy_reg): Use them.
	(copy_internal): Use them here, too.

2005-12-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sleep.c (usage): Say what happens with two or more arguments.
	Suggested by Justin Pryzby.

	* src/uptime.c (print_uptime): Move decl of `upsecs' into scope
	where it's used.

2005-12-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/rm.c (long_opts): Change the name of each undocumented, for-
	testing-only option to start with `-', so that it cannot render
	ambiguous any prefix it happens to share with some other option name.
	Problem reported by Eric Blake.
	* src/head.c (long_options): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (long_options): Likewise.

	* tests/misc/head-elide-tail: Update uses of undocumented, for-
	testing-only --presume* options to start with `---'.
	* tests/rm/dangling-symlink: Likewise.
	* tests/rm/dir-no-w: Likewise.
	* tests/rm/isatty: Likewise.

2005-11-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint: Add a comment about cvsu.

2005-11-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: df updates for "none", "proc", inaccessible file systems.
	* src/df.c (show_point): Ignore inaccessible file systems.
	(usage): -a includes dummy file systems, not size-0 file systems.

	* src/od.c (unsigned_long_long_int): Renamed from ulonglong_t,
	to avoid collision with POSIX name space.  All uses changed.

2005-11-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add acl to the list.
	* tests/acl: Add `$0: ' prefix to diagnostics.

	* .x-sc_require_config_h: Add lib/buffer-lcm.c to the list.

2005-11-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c: Improve performance a bit by optimizing away
	unnecessary system calls and going to a block size of at least
	8192 (on normal hosts, anyway).  This improved performance 5% on my
	Debian stable host (2.4.27 kernel, x86, copying from root
	ext3 file system to itself).
	Include "buffer-lcm.h".
	(copy_reg): Omit last argument.  All callers changed.
	Use xmalloc to allocate rather than trusting alloca
	(which is unwise with large block sizes).
	Declare locals more locally, if possible.
	Use uintptr_t words instead of int words, for a bit more speed
	when looking for null blocks on 64-bit hosts.
	Optimize away reads of zero bytes on regular files.
	In the typical case, insist on 8 KiB buffers, at least.
	Avoid unnecessary extra call to fstat when checking for sparse files.
	Avoid now-unnecessary cast to off_t, and "0L".
	Avoid unnecessary test of *new_dst when checking for same owner
	and group.

2005-11-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/remove.c (rm): Don't assume C99 for-loop syntax.

2005-11-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_push): Remove debugging cruft.

	* tests/rm/unread2 (rm): Change expected diagnostic,
	`cannot open directory' to `cannot remove', to align with
	new version of rm.
	* tests/rm/rm2: Ensure that rm now continues removing entries
	even after certain types of failure.

	* src/remove.c: Rewrite.  Now, this module is reentrant on systems
	that provide openat (Solaris), and on systems like Linux+procfs
	where our openat emulation code is reentrant.  This also fixes a
	few low-probability leaks and eliminates some code that could,
	in very unusual circumstances, cause rm() (via a callee) to exit.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	* configure.ac: Put copyright dates all on one line so the
	emacs function that updates them works properly.

2005-11-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.ac (AM_PROG_CC_C_O): Add.  Needed for CVS Automake.
	Problem reported by Eric Blake.
	(AC_PROG_CC_STDC): Use this instead of AC_PROG_CC, so that
	we get a standard-conforming compiler.  This relies on the new
	m4/c.m4 file.  Note that it's a bit tricky, since c.m4 doesn't
	define AC_PROG_CC_STDC; we are relying on Autoconf 2.59 internals.
	m4/c.m4 can go away with Autoconf 2.60 comes out.

2005-11-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_mark_helper): Make a `char *' parameter `const'.
	(AD_mark_current_as_unremovable): Likewise, but for a local.
	(rm_1): Likewise.

	* tests/mv/acl: Let traps handle removing temporary directories.

	Expect acl-related tests to fail, until the corresponding
	patches are committed.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Add acl.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Likewise.

	ACL tests, from Andreas Gruenbacher.
	* tests/acl, tests/mv/acl, tests/cp/acl: New files.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add acl.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add acl.

	* src/ls.c (basename_is_dot_or_dotdot): Correct wording in comment.

2005-11-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Improve quality of ln's diagnostics.
	* src/ln.c (do_link, usage): Likewise.
	(do_link): Don't use alloca on a buffer of unbounded size.

2005-11-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Accommodate HPUX.  It appears to fail
	with EACCES rather than EPERM.  Reported by Peter O'Gorman here:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/5766
	This also affects AIX 4.3.3, according to Ralf Wildenhues, in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-05/msg00192.html

2005-11-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS (sort): Mention consequences of today's mkstemp-safer.c fix.

2005-11-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen: Accept new option, --gpg-key-id=ID and
	emit a blurb telling how to use the .sig files.
	* Makefile.cfg (gpg_key_ID): Define.
	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Use new option and key.

	Require that most .c files include <config.h>.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_require_config_h): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	* .x-sc_require_config_h: New file listing exceptions to the
	above rule.  Some are legit, others are simply grandfathered in.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_require_config_h here, too.

2005-11-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/checksum.h, src/md5.c, src/sha1sum.c: Remove now-unused files.

2005-11-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention `readlink -f' bug fix in 5.3.0 news.
	Mention new readlink options in 5.3.0's `New features' section.
	Spotted by Thomas Hood.

2005-11-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Merge in changes from b5_9x branch.

2005-11-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: ls now defaults to --time-style='locale', which in turn acts
	like --time-style='posix-long-iso' if the locale settings are messed up.
	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Implement this.

2005-11-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/2g: s/expensive/very expensive/ in a comment.
	From Paul Townsend.

2005-10-17  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Fix descriptions of --sort, --time.
	Reported by Vitaly A. Ostanin.

2005-11-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ln.c: Include filenamecat.c.
	(FILE_BASENAME_CONCAT): Remove.
	(do_link): Remove last arg DEST_IS_DIR.  All callers changed.
	(main): Use file_name_concat, base_name, and strip_trailing_slashes
	instead of FILE_BASENAME_CONCAT.  This simplifies the code, and avoids
	the use of alloca.

2005-11-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (process_file): Don't overflow for files of size >= 2^31
	on systems with stat.st_blocks of a signed 32-bit type.
	This bug causes trouble on some AIX 5.1 systems.
	Report and trivial patch from Paul Townsend:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2005-11/msg00033.html>
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	* tests/du/2g: New (very-expensive) test for the above-fixed bug.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it here.
	* tests/very-expensive: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it here.
	* tests/cp/perm: Mark this test as `very-expensive', too.

2005-11-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention that rm -d and maybe ln -d are scheduled for
	removal in 2006.
	* src/remove.h (struct rm_options): Remove unlink_dirs.  All uses
	removed.
	* src/rm.c (usage): Don't mention rm -d.

2005-11-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/dd/skip-seek: Fix typo in comment: s/fileutils/coreutils.
	From Andreas Schwab.

	* tests/dd/unblock-sync: Redirect stderr to /dev/null so the
	`M+N records in/out' lines don't pollute `make check' output.

	* tests/dd/skip-seek (sk-seek4): New test, to exercise the bug
	fixed on 2005-10-31.  This test uses the new, IN_PIPE specifier.
	* tests/Coreutils.pm: Accept a new type of input specifier: IN_PIPE,
	to indicate that the input file should be piped into the command
	under test (via `cat FILE | $prog ...').

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Emit a better diagnostic when rm
	(without -r) fails to remove a directory on a non-Linux system.
	This change affects only newer Solaris systems (with priv_*
	functions like priv_allocset).  Reported by Keith Thompson.

	* tests/rm/dir-nonrecur: New file/test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dir-nonrecur.

2005-11-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: "tail -c 2 FILE" and "touch 0101000000" now operate as
	POSIX 1002.1-2001 requires.
	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolete_option): Implement this.
	Problem reported by Vincent Lefevre.
	* src/touch.c (main): Pass PDS_PRE_2000 to posixtime.
	* tests/tail/Test.pm (c-2, c-2-minus, c2, c2-minus): New tests.
	(test_vector): Add special cases for _POSIX2_VERSION, and
	regularize the old ones a bit.
	* tests/touch/obsolescent: Add y2000 test.

2005-10-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/dd.c (skip): Fix off-by-one error reported by

	boundary between DEST and SOURCE in the result.

2005-10-26  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* src/md5sum.c (main) [!O_BINARY]: Changed default read mode
	back to text, to sync with documentation and for backwards
	compatibility.

2005-10-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/dircolors/simple (other-wr): Add an explicit test for
	the dircolors bug (NULL-dereference) fixed yesterday.

2005-10-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tac.c (tac_file): When determining whether a file is seekable,

	* src/dircolors.c: Add compile-time assertion that the slack_codes
	and ls_codes arrays have the same number of elements.  This would
	have prevented the above-fixed bug.

	* src/expand.c (parse_tab_stops): Add a comment to make this function
	identical to the one in unexpand.c.
	* src/unexpand.c (parse_tab_stops): Adjust syntax to make this function

2005-10-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/md5sum.c (digest_check, main): Use ptr_align rather than
	a dangerous pointer-value-to-`unsigned' cast.

	own directory.

2005-08-28  David Madore  <david.madore@ens.fr>

	* tests/sha1sum/basic-1 (million-a): Add the "million a's" test (one
	of the FIPS test vectors).

2005-10-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Problem reported by Eric Blake.

2005-10-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/dircolors/simple (quote): Add test for the above fix.

2005-10-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Add a comment explaining (probably) why this
	test fails on OpenBSD 3.2 when run in an NFS-mounted directory.

2005-10-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Use 5.92-cvs as the version string.
	* NEWS: Adjust accordingly.

	* Makefile.maint (my-distcheck): Depend on
	$(release_archive_dir)/$(prev-tgz) here, so that if it's missing
	we fail earlier.

2005-10-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.91.

	* Makefile.maint (VERSION_REGEXP): New variable.

	* src/tail.c (parse_options): Remove --allow-missing option.
	You can use --retry instead.
	* src/stat.c (main): Remove --link -l options.
	You can use --dereference (-L) instead.

2005-09-30  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>  (tiny change)

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Remove temp directory first.
	* NEWS: Document dircolors change of 2005-09-05.

2005-10-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Redo previous change, since I'm
	no longer confident that the m4/stdbool.m4 patch suffices.

2005-10-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Undo previous change, since
	today's change to m4/stdbool.m4 should catch it.

2005-10-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* TODO: rm: add support for a -I option, like that from FreeBSD's.

2005-10-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Declare temporary as `int' rather
	than `bool' to work around AIX 5.3 compiler bug in 64-bit mode.
	From James Lemley.

2005-10-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/factor.c (MAX_N_FACTORS): Define in terms of sizeof (uintmax_t)
	rather than hard-coding to 128.  From Thomas M.Ott.

2005-10-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_unmarked_diagnostics):
	Search only cvs-controlled files.

2005-09-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/install/trap: Work around a bug in FreeBSD 5.0.

2005-09-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Warn about a (now-)known problem on FreeBSD 5.0:

2005-09-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/touch.c (touch): Handle "touch -c - >&-" by checking for EBADF
	and ENOSYS.
	Do not pass "-" to futimens; pass NULL instead.
	If close (STDIN_FILENO) fails, report the error separately instead
	of letting the 'close' pollute errno.
	* tests/touch/empty-file: Test "touch -" too.
	* tests/touch/no-create-missing: Likewise.
	* tests/touch/read-only: Likewise.

2005-09-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/touch/read-only: New test, for root of chmod/usage failure.
	* tests/touch/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add read-only.

	Work around the root cause of alpha-linux-1.sf.net test failure.
	* tests/chmod/usage: Remove *all* files before each inner loop
	iteration.  Otherwise, with a touch program that fails on unwritable
	files, (this happens at least on linux-2.2.20) a -w file left behind
	from a previous iteration could cause a spurious test failure.

2005-09-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/chmod/usage: Undo the s/files/file/ change, but add
	comments about why the old version was desired.

2005-09-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls-2/tests (setuid-etc): Work around output mismatch when
	a just-created test file cannot be made set-group-ID.

	Avoid test failures on alpha-linux-1.sf.net.
	* tests/chmod/usage: Use newer trap and tmpdir-creation framework.
	Fix apparent typos (s/files/file/) in inner loop.

2005-09-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: "touch -" now touches standard output.
	* src/touch.c (touch): Implement this.
	(usage): Document this.

	* src/copy.c (HAVE_FCHMOD, HAVE_FCHOWN): Define to 0 if not defined.
	(copy_reg): New args CHOWN_SUCCEDED and DST_SB.  All callers changed.
	Add a "goto close_src_and_dst_desc;" that was missing in the
	previous patch.
	(copy_reg) [HAVE_FCHOWN]: Prefer fchown to chown.
	(copy_reg) [HAVE_FCHMOD]: Prefer fchmod to chmod.
	(copy_internal): Don't invoke chown if fchown worked,
	and likewise for chmod and fchmod.

2005-09-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c: Use `#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H', not `#if HAVE_CONFIG_H',
	for consistency with gnulib.
	* src/dircolors.c: Likewise.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_no_if_have_config_h): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	.x-sc_no_if_have_config_h: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.

	* tests/seq/basic (eq-wid-1, eq-wid-2): Disable these tests for now.
	They fail with non-gcc compilers and some combinations
	of options and libraries on Solaris systems.

	* tests/misc/date (uninit-64): Restore this test.
	Add start-up code to detect, and work around, the cases in
	which the test might fail.

2005-09-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/misc/date (uninit-64): Remove this test.  It wasn't
	portable in theory (it doesn't work on hosts where 'int' is 64
	bits, example) or in practice (Solaris 8 localtime returns garbage
	in tm_year for the specified date, but that's not coreutils's
	fault).

2005-09-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Preserve time stamps if
	x->preserve_timestamps is set, using futimens so that
	we needn't resolve the path again.
	(copy_internal): Don't preserve time stamps if copy_reg did it
	already.
	* src/install.c (change_timestamps): First arg is source
	struct stat, not file name.  All uses changed.
	(install_file_in_file): Stat the source file.
	Don't try to change time stamps if copy_file did it.
	* src/system.h: Don't include utime.h; not needed.
	(struct utimbuf) [!defined HAVE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF]: Remove; not needed.

2005-09-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/od.c: Use `verify' to ensure that our hard-coded
	bytes_to_*_digits arrays are long enough.  Of course, 17+-byte
	integral types aren't on the near horizon, but just in case...
	(MAX_INTEGRAL_TYPE_SIZE): Move definition to precede new first use.
	(bytes_to_oct_digits, bytes_to_signed_dec_digits):
	(bytes_to_unsigned_dec_digits, bytes_to_hex_digits): Change base
	type from `char' to the clearer `unsigned int'.

2005-09-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/rmdir.c (EEXIST, ENOTEMPTY): Remove unused macros.

	Sync from gnulib.

	* src/dircolors.c: Include strcase.h.
	* src/pinky.c: Include canon-host.h rather than declaring
	canon_host ourselves.
	* src/who.c: Likewise.

	* src/system.h (X2NREALLOC, X2REALLOC): Moved here from
	../lib/xalloc.h, with args properly parenthesized, and using
	verify_expr rather than the old VERIFY_EXPR.

2005-09-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/install/basic-1: Require that this test be run as non-root.
	Otherwise, it fails due to the fact that the chmod 0 . doesn't
	affect root.

2005-09-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (write_protected_non_symlink): Change comment to
	agree with the code.

2005-09-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Return RM_ERROR, not `1',
	when attempting to remove `/' with --preserve-root.

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Syntactic tweak: move an
	assignment out of an if-expression.

2005-09-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/extract-magic (usage): Request that additions be sent to
	bug-coreutils@gnu.org, too.

2005-09-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/date (rfc822-1): Compensate for Solaris 5.9's /bin/sh,
	which emits a diagnostic to stderr when this test's LC_ALL=de_DE
	setting cannot be honored.

	* tests/misc/date (subfmt-up1): Put quotes around format string
	to protect `^' from interpretation by some shells.
	Add a use of OUT_SUBST to compensate for Solaris strftime's slightly
	different formatting of %c.

	* src/dd.c (main): When failing to truncate, mention both the seek
	block count and the block size, in case the block size is very large.
	Now `make distcheck' should pass, once again.

2005-09-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c: Include stat-time.h.
	(copy_internal): Use its functions instead of the obsolete
	TIMESPEC_NS macro.
	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise.
	* src/date.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/du.c (struct duinfo, duinfo_init, duinfo_set, duinfo_add):
	(show_date, print_size, process_file): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (change_timestamps): Likewise.
	* src/ls.c (cmp_ctime, cmp_mtime, cmp_atime, print_long_format):
	Likewise.
	* src/pr.c (init_header): Likewise.
	* src/stat.c (human_time, print_stat): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (record_open_fd, tail_forever): Likewise.
	* src/test.c (get_mtime, binary_operator): Likewise.
	* src/touch.c (touch, main): Likewise.
	* src/test.c (get_mtime): Renamed from age_of.  All uses changed.

2005-09-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Date no longer needs to allocate virtual memory to do its job,
	so it can no longer fail due to an out-of-memory condition.

	* src/date.c: Include fprintftime.h.
	Don't include strftime.h or xanstrftime.h -- no longer needed.
	(show_date): Use new fprintftime function rather than xanstrftime.
	Correct comment: this function no longer handles a NULL format string.
	* src/du.c: Likewise.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

	* tests/misc/date (subfmt-up1): Test the combination of the
	to-upper-case modifier (^) and a conversion specifier that
	expands to a string containing lower case characters.

2005-09-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: uname -a no longer generates the -p and -i outputs if they
	are unknown.
	* src/uname.c (usage): Document this.
	(main): Implement this.

2005-09-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/date (tz-5w, tz-5wf): Test new %:z format with
	a field width.

2005-09-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/dd.c: Detect some very unlikely buffer overflows.
	(INPUT_BLOCK_SLOP, OUTPUT_BLOCK_SLOP): New macros.
	(MAX_BLOCKSIZE): Now accepts an arg.  All uses changed.
	(page_size): New var.
	(scanargs, skip, main): Use more-straightforward way to detect overflow.
	(dd_copy): Use page_size rather than invoking getpagesize.
	Use INPUT_BLOCK_SLOP, OUTPUT_BLOCK_SLOP.
	(main): Set page_size.
	Avoid a call to stat in the usual case where ftruncate succeeds.

	* src/expr.c (docolon): Add IF_LINT check to avoid GCC warning.

	* configure.ac: Don't invoke AC_CONFIGURE_HOST directly; AB_INIT
	does it for us, and our invocation evokes a diagnostic from
	Autoconf 2.59.

	* NEWS: date has a new --rfc-3339 option, and the old --iso-8601
	option is deprecated.  date, du, ls, and pr also have new time format
	specifiers %:z, %::z, %:::z.
	* src/date.c (TIME_SPEC_DATE): No longer needs to be nonzero, so
	remove the "=1".
	(TIME_SPEC_HOURS, TIME_SPEC_MINUTES): Must be at end now, so put
	them there.
	(time_spec_string, time_spec): Hours and minutes must be at
	start now, so put them there.
	(rfc_2822_format): Now a string constant, not a boolean.  All uses
	changed.
	(iso_8601_format, rfc_format): Remove.
	(RFC_3339_OPTION): New constant.
	(long_options): Add --rfc-3339.
	(usage): Add --rfc-3339.  Don't mention --iso-8601.
	Mention %:z, %::z, %:::z.
	(main): Simplify calculation of 'format'; it was getting too hairy
	to follow.  Add --rfc-3339.
	(show_date): Assume format arg is not NULL, which is the case
	now.  The default code is moved to 'main'.  This simplifies things
	and allows the default to be calculated just once.
	* tests/misc/date: Add tests for --rfc-3339, %:z, %::z, %:::z.

2005-09-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP_ENV): Add --rsyncable option.
	(makefile-check): Escape a `$' in a diagnostic.

	* configure.ac: Use AB_INIT (from autobuild).

	* src/factor.c (usage): Remove leading spaces in 2-line
	description, so that help2man doesn't mangle it.
	Reported by Justin Pryzby.

2005-09-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	csplit could produce corrupt output, given input lines longer than 8KB

	* src/csplit.c (load_buffer): Don't read from free'd memory
	when handling lines longer than the initial buffer length.
	(save_to_hold_area): Don't leak the previous hold_area buffer.
	Reported by Tristan Miller and Luke Kendall.
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* tests/misc/csplit: New test for this.

	* src/csplit.c (load_buffer): Avoid integer overflow in buffer
	size calculations for very long lines.

2005-09-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Support regular expressions in 64-bit code correctly, by
	importing the latest gnulib regexp code, and not assuming
	that sizes fit in 32 bits.
	* src/csplit.c (process_regexp): Store match length in regoff_t,
	not int.  Assume that negative return values less than -2
	represent regoff_t overflow.
	* src/expr.c (docolon): Likewise.
	* src/nl.c (proc_text): Likewise.
	* src/ptx.c (SKIP_SOMETHING, find_occurs_in_text): Likewise.
	* src/tac.c (tac_seekable): Likewise.

	int versus size_t mismatch.

	* NEWS: Document "niceness" vs "nice value".
	* configure.ac (utils_cv_func_setpriority): Simplify the tests.

2005-09-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/date (neg-secs2, fill-1, fill-2): Add new tests.

2005-09-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use the phrase "niceness" instead of "nice value" to describe
	the biased nice value that can go negative.  This corrects
	a discrepancy with POSIX, which states that nice values are
	nonnegative.
	* src/nice.c (GET_NICENESS): Renamed from GET_NICE_VALUE.
	All uses changed.
	(usage): Say "niceness" rather than "nice value".
	(main): Say "niceness" rather than "priority" (which is something else
	entirely nowadays).

2005-09-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (time_args): Use NULL in place of 0.

2005-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Document the default colors for the new strings.
	From Mike Frysinger, based on a patch from Fedora.
	* tests/ls-2/tests (setuid-etc): New test, for the above.

2005-08-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: "rm -FOO" now suggests "rm ./-FOO" if the file "-FOO"
	exists and "-FOO" is not a valid option.
	* src/rm.c: Include lstat.h, quotearg.h.
	(diagnose_leading_hyphen): New function.
	(main): Use it.

2005-08-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c: Go ahead and leave the patch in (i.e., revert
	today's change).  It doesn't cause a problem after all, since
	--exclude-from=- is always handled before --files0-from=F.

	* src/du.c: Revert the du.c part of the change from 2005-07-02:
	That change (to reopen stdin on F for --files0-from=F) made it so
	--exclude-from=- and --files0-from=F would not work together.

2005-08-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Use `5.3.1-cvs' as the version string.
	* NEWS: Adjust accordingly.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_useless_cpp_parens): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	* .x-sc_useless_cpp_parens: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.

	* src/od.c: Include <float.h> unconditionally.
	* src/uptime.c (print_uptime): Remove unnecessary parens in
	`#if defined (SYMBOL)' expressions.
	* src/system.h: Likewise.
	* src/hostname.c: Likewise.
	* src/su.c: Likewise.
	* src/test.c: Likewise.

2005-08-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (xwrite_stdout): Rename from xwrite.  Remove always-
	equal-to-STDOUT_FILENO parameter and associated assertion.
	Adjust all callers.

2005-08-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ln.c (do_link): If ln is invoked with --interactive (-i),
	encounters an existing destination file, and gets an affirmative
	response, then first try to unlink the destination file rather
	than simply failing.  Suggestion from Karl Berry.
	FIXME: add test for this

	* src/ln.c (main): Declare `target_directory' with const attribute.
	* src/du.c (time_style): Add `const' attribute.
	(tot_dui): Remove unnecessary (and too-short) initializer list.

2005-08-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (usage) [-b,-t]: Ensure that there are at least two
	spaces between each option and the corresponding description -- this
	lets help2man format entries properly.  Reported by Edward Welbourne.

2005-08-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (usage): Fix typo s/POS 2/POS2/.
	Reported by Edward Welbourne.

	* tests/misc/date [neg-secs]: New test for today's strftime.c bug fix.
	* tests/misc/date: Remove terminating "\n"s once again.
	Automatically add them whenever EXIT != 0.

2005-08-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/df.c (show_dev): New arg STAT_FILE.  All uses changed.
	This sometimes gives better results on networked file systems
	that do not respect POSIX semantics.  Problem reported by
	Bruno Haible.

2005-08-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't print uninitialized data (or anything else) to stdout
	upon localtime failure.
	* src/date.c (show_date): Remove stray `puts (buf);' (debugging?)
	from the 2004-02-02 change.
	* tests/misc/date (uninit-64): New test for the above.
	Rewrite all other OUT strings to include the terminating "\n".

2005-08-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/md5sum.c (usage): Fix typo s/formated/formatted/ reported
	by Norbert Kiesel.

	Use one fewer file descriptor in a common case.
	* src/touch.c: Include "fd-reopen.h", rather than "fcntl--.h".
	Use fd_reopen rather than open.

2005-08-14  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	* src/test.c (age_of): Return the nanoseconds part of the timestamp,
	if available.
	(binary_operator) [-nt, -ot]: Use nanosecond values to break ties.

2005-08-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (long_time_expected_width): Revert last change, just to
	be paranoid, and add a comment explaining why.  Paul Eggert mentioned
	the possibility.

	* src/wc.c: Don't define mbrtowc at all.
	If mbstate_t is not defined, then AC_TYPE_MBSTATE_T will define
	it to `int' for us.  Now wc.c really does compile on HP-UX 11.23.

2005-08-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/date: Remove directory
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove date.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove tests/date/Makefile.

	* tests/Coreutils.pm: New keywords, ENV and ENV_DEL, to support
	tests/misc/date.

	With todays additions, the generated shell script,
	tests/date/date-tests had becoming far too large (over 350KB),
	so use the superior-but-perl-requiring framework instead.
	* tests/date/Test.pm: Move all tests from here...
	* tests/misc/date: ...to this new file.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add date.

	* tests/date/Test.pm (test_vector) [cross-dst]: New test for
	just-fixed getdate.y bug.
	* tests/date/Test.pm (test_vector): Add 364 more tests like the above.
	Remove unused $sunos4 variable.

2005-08-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nohup.c (main): Explain why we reopen stdin for write-only access.

	* src/ls.c (long_time_expected_width): Don't test for failed localtime.
	That cannot happen when the result date's year is in range.
	Add an assertion instead.

	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Use cleaner `sizeof *VAR_NAME'
	rather than `sizeof (TYPE_NAME)'.
	* src/ptx.c (sort_found_occurs, digest_word_file): Likewise.
	(alloc_and_compile_regex): Likewise.

	* src/wc.c: Test `!defined HAVE_MBSTATE_T' rather than
	`defined mbstate_t' to detect missing support for mbstate_t.
	The latter didn't work for HP-UX 11.23.

	Add bulletproofing in case stdin is closed.
	* src/dircolors.c (have_read_stdin): Remove global variable.
	(dc_parse_stream): Always use stdin (freopen, if needed) rather
	than sometimes using fopen to get a new file descriptor.
	Call fclose unconditionally.
	(main): Don't close stdin here.  If needed, now it's already done
	by dc_parse_stream.

	* src/dircolors.c (dc_parse_file): Remove comment about
	now-removed OPENOPTS.

	* src/fold.c (fold_file): Cosmetic: use X2REALLOC rather than x2realloc.
	* src/pr.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/csplit.c (new_control_record): Cosmetic: use X2NREALLOC (only
	two arguments) rather than x2nrealloc (with three).
	* src/cut.c (ADD_RANGE_PAIR): Likewise.
	* src/expand.c (add_tab_stop): Likewise.
	* src/join.c (extract_field, getseq): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (decode_format_string): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (add_temp_dir): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (add_tab_stop): Likewise.

	* src/pr.c (main): Cosmetic: use '\0' in place of 0.

2005-08-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/date.c: Include "xanstrftime.h".
	(show_date): Use xanstrftime instead of open-coding it.
	* src/du.c: Likewise.

2005-07-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/date.c (show_date): Remove now-unnecessary code that
	treated an empty format string as a special case.
	* tests/date/Test.pm (empty-format): New test, for this case.

2005-07-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/md5sum.c (usage): Adjust printf argument list to match
	new format string.

2005-07-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: md5sum --check now accepts multiple input files, and
	similarly for sha1sum.  Extension suggested by Chris Girling.
	* src/md5sum.c (usage, main): Support this new usage.

2005-07-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix a problem noted by James Youngman: VPATH-style builds don't
	work because of po file problems.
	* src/Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Remove false.c.
	(false.c): Remove; it's now a source file.
	* src/false.c: New file.
	* src/true.c (EXIT_STATUS): New macro.
	(PROGRAM_NAME, usage): Behave like "false" if EXIT_STATUS indicates.
	(usage): Remove "These option names may not be abbreviated."

2005-07-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/nohup.c (main): Don't worry about POSIXLY_CORRECT.  Today's
	Austin Group Minutes says that the GNU behavior will be put
	forward as proposed text for a future revision.

2005-07-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am (nanosec_libs): Remove $(FESETROUND_LIBM); no longer
	needed.  Problem reported by Jeff Bailey.

2005-07-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (copyright-check): Reflect rearrangement in
	version-etc files.

2005-07-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Binary input and output are now implemented more consistently.
	These changes affect only platforms like MS-DOS that distinguish
	between binary and text files.
	* src/cat.c (usage, main, long_options) [O_BINARY]:
	Remove support for -B.  Use same rules as other programs to decide
	whether to use binary I/O, except that the -bensAE options always
	select text mode.
	* src/cat.c (main): Avoid setmode; use POSIX-specified routines instead.
	* src/cksum.c (cksum): Likewise.
	* src/head.c (head_lines, head_file): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (open_next_file): Likewise.

	* src/tail.c (tail_bytes, tail_lines, tail_file, main): Likewise.
	* src/tee.c (tee): Likewise.
	* src/tr.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/wc.c (wc): Likewise.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Always copy in binary mode.
	* src/expand.c (expand): Always copy in text mode.  POSIX says
	the input and output must be text.
	* src/unexpand.c (unexpand): Likewise.
	* src/head.c (elide_tail_bytes_file, elide_tail_lines_file, head_bytes):
	(head_lines, head_file): Always use binary mode except for std tty.
	* src/md5sum.c (usage): Clarify whether text or binary is the default.
	(split_3, main): BINARY is now a 3-way value.  All uses changed.
	(digest_file): Likewise.  Clear *BINARY if we determine the file
	to be text.  All uses changed.
	(main): Don't report a file to be binary if we actually read it
	as text in MS-DOS, because it was a terminal.
	* src/shred.c (wipefile): Always use binary mode.  Clearly this
	never worked right on DOS!
	* src/system.h (setmode, fileno): Remove; no longer needed, we think.
	(SET_MODE, SET_BINARY, SET_BINARY2): Remove.
	[defined __DJGPP__]: Don't include <io.h> or <sys/exceptn.h>.
	* src/wc.c (wc_file): FILE might be null now.
	(main): Simplify code a bit, so that fewer places need the
	setmode fixes.

2005-07-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/comm.c, src/csplit.c, src/dd.c, src/join.c, src/md5sum.c:
	* src/pr.c, src/sort.c, src/tee.c:
	Don't include stdio.h; no longer needed.

2005-07-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix porting problems reported by Eric Blake.

	* configure.ac: Remove check for AC_HEADER_TIOCGWINSZ.
	* src/cat.c, src/ls.c, src/stty.c: Include stropts.h if available,
	because POSIX says that's where ioctl is declared.
	* src/cat.c: Use HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H instead of _POSIX_SOURCE
	to decide whether to include <sys/ioctl.h>.
	* src/stty.c: Use only HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H to decide whether
	to include <sys/ioctl.h>.

	* src/id.c (print_user): Don't assume uid fits in unsigned int.
	(print_group): Likewise, for gid.

2005-07-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h (DECIMAL_DIGIT_ACCUMULATE): Generate a hard error
	(not just a warning) if GCC is used and the types don't match.

2005-07-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h (VERIFY_W_TYPEOF): Remove; no longer needed.
	(DECIMAL_DIGIT_ACCUMULATE): Change last arg from T's maximum value
	to T itself.  All callers changed.  Check that T is unsigned, and
	that Accum is of type T.  This fixes a bug in the unlikely case
	where SIZE_MAX <= INT_MAX, and it no longer requires typeof to do
	the proper validity checks.

	* src/od.c: Adjust to verify.h change.
	* src/system.h (VERIFY_W_TYPEOF): Likewise.

2005-07-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Include "verify.h".

	* src/system.h (verify): Rename from VERIFY_EXPR, to be lower case,
	like assert.  Use sizeof, rather than equivalent ((...)0), for
	it's slightly simpler syntax.  Suggestions from Paul Eggert.
	(verify_decl): Rename from VERIFY.
	* src/od.c: Reflect name change.

2005-07-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: cp and mv: the --reply=X option is deprecated
	Suggested by Bob Proulx, after numerous user complaints
	about how --reply=no appeared not to work.
	* src/mv.c (main): Using --reply now evokes a warning.
	(usage): Remove description of --reply.
	* src/cp.c (main): Using --reply now evokes a warning.
	(usage): Remove description of --reply.
	* tests/mv/i-link-no: Adjust for new diagnostic.
	* tests/mv/reply-no: Likewise.

	* src/printf.c (verify_numeric): Rename from verify.
	Update caller.

2005-07-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.h: Include "lstat.h" rather than rolling our own.
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.
	* src/remove.c: Likewise.

2005-07-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	(create_output_file): Use fopen, not fopen_safer.
	* src/dd.c: Include fd-reopen.h.
	(open_fd): Remove.  All callers changed to use fd_reopen instead.
	* src/join.c: Include stdio--.h, not stdio-safer.h.
	(main): Use fopen, not fopen_safer.
	* src/md5sum.c: Include stdio--.h.
	(digest_check): Don't try to read both checksums and data from stdin.
	* src/nohup.c: Include fd-reopen.h.
	Include unistd--.h, not unistd-safer.h.
	(main): Use fd_reopen to simplify code.  When replacing stdin,
	use "/dev/null" not "/", as that's less likely to go wrong these days.
	(main): Use dup, not dup_safer.
	* src/pr.c: Include stdio--.h, not stdio-safer.h.
	(open_file): Invoke fopen, not fopen_safer.
	* src/shred.c: Include fcntl--.h, not unistd-safer.h.
	(wipename, wipe_file): Don't use fd_safer; no longer needed
	now that we include fcntl--.h.

	(cwrite): Don't call fd_safer; no longer needed now that
	we include fcntl--.h.
	(main): Reuse stdin rather than opening a new one.  This
	saves a file descriptor.
	* src/stty.c: Include fd-reopen.h.
	(display_all, display_settings, display_window_size, set_window_size):
	Remove fd arg, since we now assume stdin.  All callers changed.
	(main): Reuse stdin rather than opening a new one.  This
	saves a file descriptor.
	* src/tac.c: Include stdlib--.h rather than unistd-safer.h.
	(copy_to_temp): Don't call fd_safer; no longer needed now
	that we include stdlib--.h.
	* src/tail.c: Include fcntl--.h, not unistd-safer.h.

	(touch): Don't call fd_safer; no longer needed now that
	we include fcntl--.h.

	(writeline): Remove stream arg; we now always output to stdout.
	All callers changed.
	(check_file): Reuse stdout rather than opening a new stream.
	This saves a file descriptor.

2005-07-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_obsolete_symbols): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it to the list.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_obsolete_symbols.
	* .x-sc_obsolete_symbols: New file.

2005-07-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Assume HAVE_FCNTL_H (i.e., include <fcntl.h>
	unconditionally, and don't include <sys/file.h>).
	* src/system.h: Likewise for HAVE_UNISTD_H.

2005-06-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c: Add uses of ARGMATCH_VERIFY to ensure that
	corresponding option string and value arrays are consistent.
	* src/date.c: Likewise.
	* src/du.c: Likewise.
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.
	cp.c and date.c each had a harmless trailing `, 0' (now-removed)
	in a value list.

	* src/system.h (VERIFY): Guard definition with #ifndef.
	(VERIFY_EXPR): Undef before defining.

2005-06-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pr.c (main, store_char): Use X2REALLOC rather than x2realloc.
	* src/du.c (show_date): Likewise.
	* src/date.c (show_date): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (dump_strings): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (fillbuf): Likewise.
	* src/chmod.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/system.h (VERIFY): Rewrite to use string-concatenation
	and __LINE__ so as not to require a struct name parameter.
	(GL_CONCAT, GL_CONCAT2): Define helper macros.
	* src/od.c: Update sole use.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Use stat.st_author, not stat.st_uid
	when computing the --author column width.  This bug might have
	resulted in misaligned columns when using the --author option
	on the Hurd.  Spotted by Arnold Robbins.

2005-06-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pr.c (main, store_char): Use x2realloc on 1-byte base types,
	not x2nrealloc.  The former is a little more concise and readable.
	N.B. this sort of transformation is ok only when the base type is
	unlikely ever to change to a multibyte type.
	* src/du.c (show_date): Likewise.
	* src/date.c (show_date): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (dump_strings): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (fillbuf): Likewise.

2005-06-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/mv.c (usage): Clarify how --reply=no works.

2005-06-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Address the following "du" issues:

	- The option name "--last-time=TYPE" is different from the ls's option
	  "--time=TYPE" with a similar meaning.  I assume this wasn't intended.

	- --time-style implies --time, but this is not true for "ls".  It's
	  better to be consistent.

	- Since we don't have POSIX compatibility concerns, there's no need
	  for the "posix-" styles, or for support of styles with newlines, or
	  for the "locale" style, except for parsing the TIME_STYLE
	  environment variable.

	- It's cleaner (and these days, no less efficient) to use functions
	  rather than macros when possible.

	- struct duinfo doesn't need a 'valid' flag; you can simply use a time
	  stamp that is less than all valid time stamps.

	- The code needs a bit of reformatting to fit the usual GNU style.

	* NEWS: du's --last-time option is now --time.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (ls invocation): Fix typo: --time=use is
	equivalent to --time=atime, not --time=ctime.
	(ls invocation, du invocation): Fix typo: --time-style=long-iso
	is equivalent to a time style with a leading "+".
	(du invocation): --last-time is now --time.
	--time-style no longer implies --time.
	The locale and posix- stuff now works only for TIME_STYLE, not
	for --time-style.  Give equivalent format for --time-style=iso.
	* src/du.c: Do not include hard-locale.h.
	(struct duinfo): Remove 'valid' member.  All uses changed to use
	negative nsec instead.
	(DUIINFO_INI, DUINFO_SET, DUINFO_ADD): Remove.
	(duinfo_init, duinfo_set, duinfo_add): New functions, taking the
	role of the removed macros.
	(opt_time): Renamed from opt_last_time.  All uses changed.
	(TIME_OPTION): Renamed from LAST_TIME_OPTION.  All uses changed.
	(long_options, usage): Rename --last-time to --time.
	(locale_time_style): Remove.
	(time_style_args, time_style_types, usage): Remove support for
	--time-style=locale.
	(show_date): Now returns void, since nobody looked at the result.
	Assume FORMAT is not null.  An empty FORMAT now outputs an empty time.
	Simplify nstrftime invocation.
	(main): Put in ls compatibility workarounds only for TIME_STYLE,
	not for --time-style.  Omit unnecessary space in iso time style.

2005-06-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (time_format): Add `const' attribute.

	* src/date.c (show_date): Use puts rather than printf ("%s\n",.

	* src/du.c (show_date): Rename local `time_format' so as not to
	shadow the file-scoped global by that name.
	(show_date): Add a FIXME comment.

	* src/du.c: Include hard-locale.h and strftime.h.
	(DUINFO_INI, DUINFO_SET, DUINFO_ADD):
	Enclose body in `do {...} while (0)', not just `{...}'.
	Adjust uses (add semicolons).

2005-05-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: `rm -r' now removes all of the files it should, even on
	systems with a buggy readdir affecting file systems inaccessible
	at configure time.

	In some unusual circumstances `rm -r' would fail to remove --
	or even consider -- all entries in a directory with more than 254
	(SunOS) or 338 (Darwin) entries.  This could cause trouble even on
	other types of systems when using an affected file system via e.g.,
	NFS.  The underlying cause was a bug in readdir on those systems.
	Coreutils-5.2.1 and earlier used a configure-time test designed
	to detect precisely those problem systems, but it would detect
	the problem and enable remove.c's work-around code only when its
	configure-time test was run on a losing file system.  Obviously,
	it couldn't detect a problem if the offending file system wasn't
	tested or even mounted at coreutils configure time.  Now, rm itself
	performs a minimal-cost run-time test to detect the problem.

	* src/remove.c (CONSECUTIVE_READDIR_UNLINK_THRESHOLD): Define.
	(remove_cwd_entries):  When readdir returns NULL for a directory from
	which we've removed more than CONSECUTIVE_READDIR_UNLINK_THRESHOLD
	entries, call rewinddir and then resume the readdir/unlink loop.
	(UNLINK_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS): Rename from ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS.

2005-04-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/nohup.c (main): If getopt fails, exit with status 127,
	not status 1.  POSIX requires this.
	* NEWS: Document this.

	* src/nice.c (main): Report proper program name when getopt finds
	trouble.  Problem reported by Behdad Esfahbod.

	* NEWS: Fix bug with "mkdir -m =+x dir"; the umask was being ignored

	* mkfifo.c (main): Likewise.
	* mknod.c (main): Likewise.
	* tests/mkdir/perm: Test for the above bug.

2005-04-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	directory is actually a symbolic link.  Problem reported by
	Eric Blake.

	* tests/mv/mv-special-1: Use test -p to test for fifos, rather
	than the (incorrect) test -f and the (inadequate) ls.  ls is
	inadequate because on some hosts a buggy mv will create a file of
	the wrong type (problem reported by Eric Blake).  Skip this test
	if test -p doesn't work.

	* tests/chmod/setgid: Use numeric group ids, not symbolic group names,
	since the latter can have shell metacharacters in them (e.g., spaces).
	This follows up to the 2005-01-17 patch, which missed this occurrence.

	* tests/install/basic-1: Use "cat", not "test", to test for
	../../src/dd.  Problem reported by Eric Blake.

2005-04-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c: Don't include stat-macros.h directly.  system.h does that.

2005-04-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Work around a couple of "make check" failures reported for Cygwin
	and ash by Eric Blake.
	* tests/install/basic-1: Skip this test if ../../src/dd isn't readable.

	since POSIX doesn't require rename to fail across file systems.
	* tests/mv/setup (dot_mount_point): Use stat rather than df, as
	it's more reliable.
	(other_partition_tmpdir): Remove df from name as that would be
	misleading now.

	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Use DECIMAL_DIGIT_ACCUMULATE macro,
	in place of functionally-equivalent code.
	* src/expand.c (parse_tab_stops, main): Likewise.
	* src/split.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (parse_tab_stops, main): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/od.c: Use VERIFY macro in place of an equivalent open-coded
	declaration.
	* src/system.h (VERIFY, VERIFY_EXPR, DECIMAL_DIGIT_ACCUMULATE):
	New macros.

	Before, this command would make uniq skip 11 fields and print
	only the first line:
	$ _POSIX2_VERSION=1 ./uniq -f1 -1 <(seq --format='1 %g' 2)
	1 1
	1 2
	* src/uniq.c (main): Interpret `uniq -f1 -1' like `uniq -f1',
	not like `uniq -f11'.

2005-03-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Both `pr -0' and e.g., `pr -03' would evoke `column count too large'.
	`pr -0' should give a better diagnostic and `pr -03' should be
	equivalent to `pr -3'.
	* src/pr.c (parse_column_count): Change return type to void.
	Call error (EXIT_FAILURE, ... for an invalid string.
	(main): Allocate space for column_count_string using malloc.
	Accumulate all old-style column-count digits before converting.
	When the number of columns is specified via both old-style,
	(e.g., -3), and a long option (--columns=5), ensure that only
	the last one specified takes effect.
	* tests/pr/Test.pm: Add tests for the above.

2005-03-15  Corinna Vinschen  <corinna@vinschen.de>  (tiny change)

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Copy regular files in binary mode.

2005-03-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Restate why ls limits time stamp lengths.

2005-03-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Add a little infrastructure to help prevent future bugs like the
	one fixed below.
	* src/stat.c (xstrcat): New function.
	(print_statfs, print_stat): Add buf_len parameter and convert all
	uses of strcat to xstrcat.  Update callers.
	(print_it): Call print_func with buf_len parameter.

	Invoking stat -c FMT with a lone format directive of %s, %f, %h, %s,
	could cause a buffer overrun error.
	* src/stat.c (print_it): Allocate 2 more bytes, to accommodate our
	conversion of the stat %s format string to the longer printf %llu one.
	Patch from Guochun Shi.

2005-03-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (TIME_STAMP_LEN_MAXIMUM): New constant.
	(long_time_expected_width, print_long_format): Use it, to avoid
	some possible denial-of-service attacks.
	* NEWS: Document this.

2005-03-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Prompt once again for `mv -i A B' when A and B are hard links
	to the same file.  This fixes a bug introduced by my 2003-04-04
	(coreutils-5.0.1) change.  Reported by Thomas Wolff via Eric Blake.
	* src/copy.c (abandon_move): New function, factored out of
	copy_internal, now that this code is being used from two places.
	(copy_internal): Perform the same interactive-related test for
	whether it's alright to proceed and (usually) overwrite the
	destination file.
	* tests/mv/i-4: Add tests for the above.

	Don't segfault for a very long date format string, e.g.,
	ls -ld --time-style=+%99999999H .
	* src/ls.c (long_time_expected_width): Use x2nrealloc, not alloca,
	so format string abuse cannot provoke stack overflow.
	(print_long_format): Likewise.

	Don't segfault for a long header date string, e.g.,
	echo a|pr -D +%9999999A
	* src/pr.c (init_header): Use x2nrealloc, rather than alloca.
	Don't bother with fixed-sized initial buffer;  always use x*alloc.

	* src/pr.c (init_header): Use slightly clearer INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND
	in place of equivalent INT_STRLEN_BOUND + 1.
	* src/expr.c (tostring, printv): Likewise.

2005-03-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h: Include intprops.h.
	(TYPE_SIGNED, TYPE_MINIMUM, TYPE_MAXIMUM, INT_STRLEN_BOUND): Remove;
	they are now defined in intprops.h.

2005-03-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* TODO: Remove entry about named pipes.  It was fixed in 5.3.0.

2005-03-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/date.c (usage): Redo to match recent documentation changes.
	Don't bother documenting which usages are GNU extensions; the list
	wasn't correct, and is better left to the printed manual anyway.

2005-03-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Factor out column-count processing.
	* src/pr.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(parse_column_count): New function.
	(main): Use the new function for both old-style, -9, and long,
	--columns=-9, options.

	* src/cksum.c: Remove `register' keyword.
	* src/cut.c: Likewise.
	* src/dd.c: Likewise.

2005-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am (nanosec_libs): Remove $(LIB_XANOSLEEP); no
	longer needed.

2005-03-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Change test of source type from
	!S_ISREG to S_ISLNK.  Reported by Paul Eggert in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-10/msg00050.html.

2005-02-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention that xnanosleep fixes sleep failure on linux-2.6.8.1.

2005-02-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am (dd_LDADD, shred_LDADD): Add $(LIB_GETHRXTIME).
	(nanosec_libs): Add $(LIB_XNANOSLEEP).  Needed for newer GNU/Linux
	hosts with clock_gettime.

2005-02-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Describe user-visible change to dd.
	* src/Makefile.am (dd_LDADD, shred_LDADD, nanosec_libs):
	Remove $(LIB_CLOCK_GETTIME).  These functions now use
	gethrxtime instead.
	* src/dd.c: Include gethrxtime.h, xtime.h.
	(start_time): Now of type xtime_t, not struct timespec.
	(print_stats, main): Use gethrxtime rather than gettime.
	* src/ls.c (time): Remove obsolete decl.
	(get_current_time): gettimeofday always returns 0, so don't
	check its result.
	* src/shred.c: Include gethrxtime.h.
	(isaac_seed): Use gethrxtime rather than a mishmash.
	* src/touch.c (time): Remove obsolete decl.

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Don't assume that the current host
	supports integers wider than 32 bits.  Fix comment typo.
	* tests/od/x8: Likewise.

	* src/chown-core.c (enum RCH_status): Remove trailing comma,
	as it's not valid in standard C89.

2005-02-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Add case/definition for S_MAGIC_XFS
	so that file systems of type `xfs' are recognized as such.
	* src/fs.h: Regenerate.
	Reported by Bernd Eckenfels.
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Likewise for S_MAGIC_JFS/jfs.
	* src/fs.h: Regenerate.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* src/nice.c (NZERO) [NZERO == 0]: Undefine and define to 20,
	to work around the invalid definition from Darwin 7.7.0.
	Test failure reported by Sébastien Maret.

2005-02-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (mergefps): Use binary search rather than linear one
	when comparing new line to lines already in main memory.
	Idea suggested by James Lemley.

2005-02-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (valid_options): Add an assertion that
	not both hard_link and symbolic_link are set.

2005-02-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document stat -f -c %S, plus changes to default formats.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (stat invocation): Normalize terminology,
	capitalization, and sort order to match --help output.  Mention %c
	for file systems.  Add new -f -c format %S, and document %s versus %S;
	problem reported by Jeroen van Wolffelaar.
	* src/stat.c (usage): Likewise.
	(STATFS_FRSIZE): New macro.
	(print_statfs): Use it, for stat -f -c %S.
	(do_statfs): Change default formats to output %S.

2005-02-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h: Include "memrchr.h".
	(memrchr) [!HAVE_DECL_MEMRCHR]: Remove decl.

2005-02-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/8gb: Also adjust the test (s/64/128/) to detect
	systems that don't support sparse files.
	Check for $2 -ge 128, rather than $2 = 128, in case
	there is a file system type that doesn't support sparse files,
	yet for which metadata takes up additional space.
	Both reported by Andreas Schwab.

2005-02-01  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>  (tiny change)

	* tests/du/8gb: Create a larger test file, so we properly
	detect that sparse files can be created on NTFS under cygwin.

2005-01-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_bytes_pipe): Correct wording in diagnostic.

	* src/stty.c: Remove unnecessary parentheses in all #if directives.

2005-01-29  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>  (tiny change)

	* .cvsignore: Ignore config.cache and config.status.lineno.
	* src/stty.c [VSWTCH]: Some systems, like Cygwin, use VSWTC
	instead of VSWTCH, for use with CSWTCH.

2005-01-29  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>  (tiny change)

	* tests/Makefile.am (.PHONY): Add check-root and root-hint.
	* tests/rwx-to-mode: Ignore ACL designation.
	* tests/setgid-check: Likewise.
	* tests/chown/separator: Quote user and group names.

2005-01-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (usage): Merge the descriptions of --no-dereference and -P.
	Suggestion from Johan Boule.

2005-01-17  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>  (tiny change)

	* src/Makefile.am (all_programs.list): Strip $(EXEEXT) and remove
	duplicates.
	* man/Makefile.am (all_programs): Revert previous patch; updated
	all_programs.list fixes this.
	(.x.1): No need to add $(EXEEXT).

2005-01-03  Corinna Vinschen  <corinna@vinschen.de>  (tiny change)

	* src/system.h: Use S_BLKSIZE value for ST_NBLOCKSIZE where
	available.

2005-01-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (v_etc_file): The version string has moved to
	version-etc-fsf.c, search that new file, not version-etc.c.

2005-01-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/group-names: Use numeric group ids, not symbolic group names,
	since the latter can have shell metacharacters in them (e.g., spaces).
	Problem reported by Eric Blake.
	* tests/chgrp/basic: Assume groups are numeric, not symbolic.
	* tests/chgrp/deref: Likewise.
	* tests/chgrp/posix-H: Likewise.
	* tests/chgrp/recurse: Likewise.

2005-01-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c (isaac_seed) [HAVE_GETHRTIME]: #if-0 this block,
	because just calling gethrtime evokes an `illegal instruction'
	failure when compiled with Sun's c89 on Solaris 8 and 9.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

	* src/shred.c (isaac_seed) [HAVE_GETHRTIME]: Don't call ISAAC_SEED
	twice with the same value of `t'.
	Replace nested #if-#else blocks with #if-#elif-#elif chain.

2005-01-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	The test, tests/tail/f-1, failed on powerpc-apple-darwin7.7.0.
	* src/tail.c (IS_TAILABLE_FILE_TYPE): Adjust definition also to include
	sockets, since that's what you get when reading from a command-line-
	supplied pipe on Darwin 7.7.
	(IS_PIPE_LIKE_FILE_TYPE): Define.
	(main): Use new IS_PIPE_LIKE_FILE_TYPE rather than simply S_ISFIFO.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.
	This same change is also required on NetBSD/sparc-1.5.
	Reported by Adrian Bunk.

	* src/expr.c (toarith): Rewrite to detect/diagnose integer overflow,
	rather than suffering silently.
	Before, expr would silently overflow and wrap around:
	  $ expr 9223372036854775808 = 0   # $(echo 2^63|bc)
	  1
	Now it detects the problem and exits nonzero:
	  $ ./expr $(echo 2^63|bc) = 0
	  ./expr: 9223372036854775808: integer is too large

	* tests/chown/separator (id_gn): Exit 77, not 1, for a test-framework
	failure, so that doesn't cause `make check' to stop.  Nelson Beebe
	reported that this test would fail with the diagnostic,
	`cannot find name for group ID 10', on one of his systems.

2005-01-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c (is_int): Don't overflow when evaluating integer
	constants.  Before, ./test $(echo 2^64|bc) -eq 0 && echo FAIL
	would print `FAIL'.

	* tests/Fetish.pm (run_tests): Add code (if-0'd out) to detect
	names of temporary files that would clash on 8.3 file systems.
	* tests/mk-script (validate): Likewise.

2005-01-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/dd/skip-seek: Shorten test names to accommodate 8.3 systems.

	* tests/tr/Test.pm (repeat-xC): Change test name from
	`repeat-Compl', to avoid 8.3 conflict with `repeat-compl'.
	Reported by Eric Blake.
	(repeat-000): Rename to `repeat-zeros' for the same reason.

2005-01-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Update version to 5.3.1.

2005-01-11  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (check-README, check-AUTHORS): Account for $(EXEEXT).
	* man/Makefile.am (all_programs): Account for $(EXEEXT).

2005-01-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/unexpand.c (add_tab_stop): Properly diagnose a tabstop list
	with decreasing values.

	* src/expand.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (main): Check for overflow in tabstop values
	specified via the obsolete form.  E.g., now this command fails:
	_POSIX2_VERSION=1 ./unexpand -$(echo '2^64+1'|bc)
	Before it would act like `_POSIX2_VERSION=1 ./unexpand -1'.
	* tests/unexpand/basic-1 (obs-ovflo): New test for this.

2005-01-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Respond to POSIX interpretations about pathchk -p dated 2005-01-06.
	* NEWS: Document the changes.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (pathchk invocation): Likewise.
	* src/pathchk.c (PORTABILITY_OPTION): New constant.
	(longopts, usage, main, validate_file_name):
	Add support for new -P option.
	Reject empty file names (unless -p is not specified and the
	current system allows empty file names).
	Change --portability so that is now equivalent to -p -P.
	Don't test whether file name is too long, if it is known to exist.
	(no_leading_hyphen): New function.
	* tests/misc/pathchk1: Add tests for empty file names and
	pathchk -P.

2005-01-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.3.0.

	`pr --columns=N' was not equivalent to `pr -N' when also using
	either -s or -w.

	* src/pr.c (main): Set `explicit_columns' for --columns=N,
	not just for -N.  This bug has existed since the introduction
	of the --columns=N option on 1998-08-15.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* tests/pr/Test.pm (test_vector): For each -N test, automatically
	create a new test vector using --columns=N.

2005-01-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/pr.c (main): Check for column count overflow with
	usages like "pr -2147483648".

2005-01-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pr.c (init_fps): Use xnmalloc, rather than xmalloc.

2005-01-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: List the precise HP-UX version numbers that are affected.
	Suggestion from Bob Proulx.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_changelog): Specify find's `-maxdepth 2'
	predicate before `-name ChangeLog' to avoid a harmless warning
	from find-4.2.10.

2005-01-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/help-version: Punt on the uptime test, since it fails when
	it can't get boot time, and I don't want that to stop `make check'.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Evaluate exclusion rules against
	the entire file name, not just the last component.
	Reported by Robert Lindgren.
	* tests/du/exclude: Test for this.
	* NEWS: Document this.

	Ensure that tests/Makefile.am's check-root actions stay up to date.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_root_tests): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it to the list.

2005-01-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/shred.x: Change one-line summary to reflect that shred does
	not remove files by default.  Suggestion from Helen Faulkner in
	http://bugs.debian.org/288552

	* README: Request VERBOSE=yes output when reporting test failures.
	Other minor changes.

	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Update.

2005-01-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/system.h: Undo previous change; we now use Autoconf.

2005-01-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/stty/row-col-1: Don't set rows or columns to zero, to avoid
	a bug in the TIOCGWINSZ ioctl on at least Solaris5.9 systems.  Setting
	either (or both) to zero would succeed, but subsequent `stty size'
	would say `no size information for this device' due to the ioctl
	failing with EINVAL.

	* src/system.h: If PRIdMAX, PRIoMAX, PRIuMAX, and PRIxMAX are
	not all defined and either ULONG_MAX or ULLONG_MAX is not defined,
	then fail at compile-time rather than let tools like od produce
	invalid results at run time.

2004-12-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/csplit.c (usage): Say the default names are `xx00, xx01, ...',
	not `xx01, xx02, ...'.
	Reported by Matt Kraai in http://bugs.debian.org/286605

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Avoid spurious failure on x86 Solaris5.9
	when using c89.

2004-12-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/split.c (usage): Mention default size.  Suggested by Dan Jacobson.

2004-12-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention that one should eval "`dircolors`" rather than
	`dircolors`.

2004-12-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/hard-link-1: Rearrange to use newer trap-handling code,
	so temporary directories aren't left behind upon e.g., interrupt.

2004-12-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (print_dir): Use "%s: not listing already-listed
	directory", not "not listing already-listed directory: %s", to
	format already-listed directories, to be consistent with other
	diagnostics involving file names and colons.

2004-12-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (__LDADD): Define, so that building `[' on
	Solaris still uses the -lgen library that it requires in order
	to get a definition of eaccess.

2004-12-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	tac would exit immediately upon I/O or temp-file creation failure.
	Now it continues on, processing any remaining command line arguments.

	* src/tac.c: Include quotearg.h.
	Use quotearg_colon in most diagnostics.
	(copy_to_temp): Rewrite not to exit upon I/O or temp-file-creation
	failure.  Before, this command (with /full/tmp being a full partition)
	  TMPDIR=/full/tmp ./tac /proc/modules tac.c
	would exit immediately upon the write error while trying to copy
	non-seekable /proc/modules to the full partition.  Now it still
	reports the failure but continues on with the remaining file.
	(tac_nonseekable): Return false also if copy_to_temp fails.
	[DONT_UNLINK_WHILE_OPEN]: Add a FIXME comment explaining that
	using atexit like this is wrong.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* tests/misc/tac-continue: New test for this.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add tac-continue.

	* tests/chown/basic: Add a few more tests.

2004-12-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Change arg name to be command_line_arg
	rather than explicit_arg, for consistency with copy.c.
	(extract_dirs_from_files): Remove ignore_dot_and_dot_dot arg, since
	it is deducible from dirname arg.  All callers changed.
	(extract_dirs_from_files, print_dir, queue_directory):
	Add command_line_arg arg.  All callers changed.
	(struct pending): Add command_line_arg member.
	(main): Use NULL rather than 0 when appropriate.
	(set_exit_status, file_failure): New functions.
	(queue_directory): Store command_line_arg into new structure.
	(print_dir, gobble_file, get_link_name):
	Use file_failure to report problems in accessing files,
	so that the exit status is set consistently.
	(print_dir): Simplify readdir failure code yet again.
	If closedir fails, report "closing directory" rather than "reading
	directory" failure.
	(xstrcoll): Use set_exit_status to set status on failure.
	* tests/ls-2/tests (no-a-isdir-b): This now exits with status 2,
	not status 1.

2004-12-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid a race condition vulnerability in chown, when used with
	--from=O:G and without the (-h) --no-dereference option.
	* src/chown-core.c (restricted_chown): New function.
	(change_file_owner): Call it.
	Reported by Ulrich Drepper.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

2004-12-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* ls now exits with status 1 on minor problems, 2 if serious trouble.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/ls.c (LS_MINOR_PROBLEM, LS_FAILURE): New constants.
	All uses of EXIT_FAILURE replaced with LS_FAILURE, unless
	specified below.
	(main): Initialize exit failure to LS_FAILURE.
	(print_dir, gobble_file, get_link_name, xstrcoll):
	Set exit status to LS_MINOR_PROBLEM if the failure is minor.
	(print_dir): Do not give up on entire directory merely because readdir
	returns EOVERFLOW.
	(usage): Explain exit status.
	* tests/help-version: ls and variants now exit with status 2
	on serious trouble.

2004-12-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document new UTC+HH:MM date syntax, and put date changes
	together.

2004-12-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/factor.c (factor): Don't list 1 as a factor of 1.
	Problem reported by Thomas Folz-Donahue.

2004-12-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/files0-from: Sanitize environment.
	Otherwise, e.g., BLOCKSIZE=k would cause a failure, and that
	setting is the default (exported from /etc/profile) on at least one
	NetBSD 1.6 system.
	* tests/du/no-deref: Likewise.
	* tests/cp/symlink-slash: Likewise.
	* tests/ls/symlink-slash: Likewise

2004-12-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/tail/Test.pm (err-6) ["tail -c"]: Avoid test failure when
	_POSIX2_VERSION=199209 is in the environment, or when building on
	e.g., OpenBSD 3.2.

2004-12-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention cut's new --complement option.

2004-10-01  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	* cut.c (complement, COMPLEMENT_OPTION): New.
	(longopts): Add --complement.
	(usage): Say not that -b, -c, and -f `print' fields,
	but rather that they `select' fields for printing.
	Describe the new --complement option.
	(mark_range_start): Extracted from set_fields.
	(print_kth): Support --complement.
	(compare_ranges): New function.
	(set_fields): Rewrite the part that populates range_start_ht,
	merging it with the part that populates printable_field.
	(main): Handle --complement.

2004-12-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/tail.c (tail_file): Set errnum to -1 if the initial "tail"
	failed.  This works around an assertion failure reported by
	Roberto Nibali in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-12/msg00012.html

2004-12-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	With using --color and with LS_COLORS saying not to color
	executables, don't stat every file.
	* src/ls.c (is_colored): New function.
	(gobble_file): Use it.
	(main): Use it here, in place of too-strict tests against NULL:
	if either ORPHAN or MISSING was set to 0 from LS_COLORS, the
	old test would fail.

2004-12-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/comm.c (compare_files): Assume setlocale exists.
	* src/join.c (keycmp): Likewise.
	* src/seq.c (decimal_point): Treat like sort.  Now char.
	All uses changed.
	(main): Assume localeconv exists.  Use same code as sort.
	* src/sort.c (C_DECIMAL_POINT): Remove.  Use changed to '.'.
	Assume setlocale exists.
	(thousands_sep): Renamed from th_sep.
	(IS_THOUSANDS_SEP): Remove.  All uses replaced by comparisons.
	(NONZERO): Parenthesize use of arg.
	(numcompare): Avoid duplicate loads.  Use ISDIGIT as boolean, for
	consistency.  Avoid unnecessary negation by reversing
	fraccompare args.
	(main): Rewrite localeconv call to match seq.c.
	* src/system.h: Assume locale.h exists.
	(HAVE_SETLOCALE): Remove.
	* src/uniq.c (different): Assume setlocale exists.

	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Minor cleanup.  Remove an unnecessary
	'volatile' on a local variable.  Rewrite to avoid unnecessary
	double-assignment to 'func' in the usual case where strcoll does
	not fail.

2004-11-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/pinky.c (gethostname): Remove decl.
	(scan_entries): Use IS_USER_PROCESS instead of by-hand code.
	* src/uptime.c (print_uptime): Use IS_USER_PROCESS and
	UT_TYPE_BOOT_TIME instead of by-hand code.
	* src/users.c (list_entries_users): Use IS_USER_PROCESS
	instead of by-hand code.
	* src/who.c (USER_PROCESS, RUN_LVL, INIT_PROCESS, LOGIN_PROCESS,
	DEAD_PROCESS, BOOT_TIME, NEW_TIME, UT_TYPE_UNDEF, UT_TYPE): Remove.
	(IS_USER_PROCESS): Move to ../lib/readutmp.h.
	(UT_TYPE_RUN_LVL, UT_TYPE_INIT_PROCESS, UT_TYPE_LOGIN_PROCESS,

	(gethostname): Remove decl.
	(list_entries_who, scan_entries): Use the new macros defined above,
	for consistency with pinky, uptime, and users.

2004-11-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix problem reported by Scott S. Tinsley for HP-UX 11.11 using
	HP's ANSI C compiler.  Declaring int functions causes warnings on
	some modern systems and shouldn't be needed to compile on ancient
	ones.
	* src/copy.h (stat, lstat, rename): Remove decls.
	* src/install.c (stat): Remove decl.
	* src/ln.c (link, symlink): Remove decls.

2004-11-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/help2man: Import help2man-1.35.1.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Remove now-unnecessary use of
	locally-added --program-name=NAME option.  Now, help2man gets
	the name from the [NAME] section (i.e. from our .x file).
	* man/install.x: Use `install', not `ginstall' in the one-line
	description.  Reported by Brendan O'Dea.
	* man/sha1sum.x: Use `sha1sum', not `shasum'.

2004-11-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Since the changes of 2004-05-22, the u.saved_cwd member at
	the bottom of the active-directory stack was no longer
	strictly necessary.  This change removes that member and uses
	the newer cwd_state parameter for the final restore_cwd.

	* src/remove.c (struct AD_ent) [u]: Remove now-unnecessary union.
	[dev_ino]: Rename from `a'.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): Add a parameter to play the role of just-removed
	bottom-of-stack cwd-state member.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): No longer return boolean.  Adjust caller.
	(AD_push_initial): Remove CWD parameter.  Adjust caller.

2004-11-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Minor performance improvements and cleanups for "touch".
	* src/touch.c (posix_date): Remove; not needed as a static var.
	All uses rewritten.
	(touch): Use new futimens function to operate more efficiently
	in some cases.  Don't stat/fstat existing file when
	(!amtime_now && change_times == (CH_ATIME | CH_MTIME)); the
	old time stamps aren't needed in that case.
	(main): change_times is int, not bool.  Simplify test for
	change_times.

2004-11-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/install.c (usage): Avoid usage that runs afoul of Docbook
	translation.  Problem reported by Eric S. Raymond.

	Restore dd's noctty flag, reverting the change of 2004-04-08.
	POSIX does not allow "dd" to use O_NOCTTY by default.
	* NEWS: Add noctty flag to dd.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (dd invocation): Likewise.
	* src/dd.c (flags, usage, main): Likewise.

2004-11-19  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@gnu.org>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Clarified description of --no-group (-G),
	--human-readable (-h), --inode (-i), --size (-s), --time,
	and --time-style.

2004-11-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Clarify description of --author.
	Tweak indentation so that help2man creates better nroff.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.

	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Don't check stdout for errors here.

	* src/pwd.c (find_dir_entry): Update comment to match reality.

2004-11-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pwd.c (robust_getcwd): Correct the comment: this function
	constructs the directory name.  The caller prints it.

2004-11-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/stat.c (STATFS): New macro, for portability to Solaris 9.
	(do_statfs): Use it.

	* src/basename.c, src/chroot.c, src/cksum.c, src/dd.c, src/dirname.c,
	src/factor.c, src/hostid.c, src/hostname.c, src/link.c, src/logname.c,

	src/sync.c, src/tsort.c, src/unlink.c, src/uptime.c, src/users.c,
	src/whoami.c, src/yes.c (main): Use getopt_long rather than getopt.
	* src/readlink.c (main): argv is not const.

	* src/cut.c (usage): Improve documentation along the lines suggested
	by Debian 5.2.1-2.
	* src/echo.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/expr.c (usage): Likewise.

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add putty, screen-bce.

	* src/pinky.c (print_entry): Fix memory leak.
	* src/who.c (print_user): Likewise.

2004-11-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: New dd operand "status=noxfer".
	* src/dd.c (C_ASCII, C_EBCDIC, C_IBM, C_BLOCK, C_UNBLOCK,
	C_LCASE, C_UCASE, C_SWAB, C_NOERROR, C_NOTRUNC, C_SYNC, C_TWOBUFS,
	C_NOCREAT, C_EXCL, C_FDATASYNC, C_FSYNC): Now constants, not
	macros.
	(STATUS_NOXFER, statuses): New constants.
	(usage, print_stats, scanargs): Add support for status=noxfer.
	(usage): Update status output to match new behavior.
	(print_stats): Always output complete byte count.
	Put space between numbers and units, as SI requires.
	Use ngettext so that i18n can use plurals for "byte" and "second".
	Don't multiply by 1e-9 (inexact); divide by 1e9 (which is exact).
	(iflag_error_msgid, oflag_error_msgid): Remove; replace uses by
	the string.
	* tests/dd/skip-seek (@Tests): Use status=noxfer to avoid
	problems with regression testing.

2004-11-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: dd now outputs total bytes, seconds, and bytes per second.
	* src/Makefile.am (dd_LDADD): Add $(LIB_CLOCK_GETTIME).
	* src/dd.c: Include "human.h".
	(w_bytes, start_time): New vars.
	(usage): Document new I/O statistics output
	(print_stats): Output new I/O statistics.
	(cleanup): Do statistics after closing stdin and stdout, so that
	the times are more accurate.
	(write_output, dd_copy): Count output bytes.
	(main): Get initial value of clock.

2004-11-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Backslash-escape `-'s in email addresses, so that they are
	rendered properly in UTF-locales.
	* man/help2man (escape_hyphens): New function.
	(main): Call it on email addresses.

	* src/sort.c (zaptemp): Mark new diagnostic for translation.

	* tests/misc/close-stdout: New file.  Test today's closeout.c change.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add close-stdout.

2004-11-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c (usage): Put the description of `[-n] STRING'
	on two lines, one for `-n STRING' and one for `STRING' so that
	help2man properly escapes the `-'.  Otherwise, the hyphen is
	rendered inappropriately in UTF-8 locales.
	Reported by Uwe Zeisberger in http://bugs.debian.org/281069.

2004-11-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document the following changes.

	* src/sort.c: Avoid O(N**2) behavior when there are many temporary
	files.
	(temptail): New variable, so that we can easily append to list.
	(create_temp_file): Create new files at end of list, so that
	searching the list has O(N*NMERGE) behavior instead of O(N**2).
	(zaptemp): Update temptail if needed.
	(mergefps, merge): Accept new arg that counts temp files, and keep it
	up to date as we create and remove temporaries.  This is for
	efficiency, so that we don't call zaptemp so often.
	All callers changed.
	(sort): Don't create array in reverse order, since the list of
	temporaries is now in the correct order.

	(zaptemp): Protect against race condition: if 'sort' is
	interrupted in the middle of zaptemp, it might unlink the
	temporary file twice, and the second time this happens the file
	might already have been created by some other process.

	(zaptemp): Warn if a temporary file is not removed.

	(create_temp_file): Use offsetof for clarity.
	(die): Move it up earlier, to clean up the code a bit.

	* src/pr.c (strtoumax): Declare if not declared.
	(skip_to_page, first_page_number, last_page_number, page_number,
	first_last_page, print_header):
	Use uintmax_t for page numbers.
	(first_last_page): Remove unnecessary forward declaration.
	Do not modify arg (it is now a const pointer).
	Return a true if successful, false (without print a diagnostic)
	otherwise.
	(main): If +XXX does not specify a valid page range, treat it
	as a file name.  This follows the response to Open Group XCU ERN 41
	<http://www.opengroup.org/sophocles/show_mail.tpl?source=L&listname=austin-group-l&id=7717>,
	which says the behavior is allowed.
	(skip_to_page): When starting page number exceeds page count,
	print both numbers in the diagnostic.
	(print_header): Detect page number overflow.

2004-11-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/uname.c [__APPLE__]: Include <mach/machine.h> and <mach-o/arch.h>.
	(main) [__APPLE__]: Get the processor type via syscall rather than
	hard-coding "powerpc".  From Toby Peterson.

	* src/sort.c (merge): Remove declarations of now-unused variables.

2004-11-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (first_same_file): Remove.  Move most of the code to....
	(avoid_trashing_input): New function.
	(merge): Avoid some silly merges, e.g., copying a single file to
	a temporary file when there are exactly 17 input files to merge.
	Take a count of temporary files rather than a max_merge arg.
	All uses changed.

2004-11-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (xfclose): Don't close stdout here (just flush it),
	since close_stdout now closes stdout unconditionally.

2004-11-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (inittables, sort_buffer_size, getmonth, mergefps,
	first_same_file, merge, sort, main): Use size_t for indexes to arrays.
	This fixes some unlikely havoc-wreaking bugs (e.g., more than INT_MAX
	temporary files).
	(getmonth, keycompare, compare): Rewrite to avoid need for alloca,
	thus avoiding unchecked stack overflow in some cases.  As a side
	effect this improve the performance of "sort -M" by a factor of 4
	on my benchmarks.

2004-11-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/stty.c: Include "vasprintf.h" since we use vasprintf now.

	* src/Makefile.am (check-AUTHORS): Don't assume \? works in a sed
	expression; it's not portable.  Problem reported by Albert Chin.
	Don't invoke a program more than once.
	* src/groups.sh (version): New variable, containing author info,
	for benefit of AUTHORS check.  Use it when acting on --version option.
	* AUTHORS: Remove duplicate lines.  Remove bogus "chroot:"
	in groups line.

	* src/system.h: Don't #define and #undef getopt around <stdlib.h>,
	as this breaks the new regime that does "#define getopt rpl_getopt".
	Problem reported by Albert Chin for Solaris 9 with Sun cc in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2004-11/msg00019.html
	I suppose this may cause problems on ancient hosts with
	incompatible getopt declarations, but we'll cross that bridge if
	the problem gets reported to us by someone who can test the fix.

2004-11-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tac.c: quote(...) file names in diagnostics.

2004-10-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Document getdate changes.

2004-10-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tac.c (tac_file): Remove temporary prototype and move this
	function `down' so that it precedes definition of tac_nonseekable.

	`tac /proc/modules' would print nothing
	Reported by Harald Dunkel in http://bugs.debian.org/278604.

	* src/tac.c (copy_to_temp): Renamed from save_stdin, since
	now it copies a general file descriptor, not just stdin.
	(tac_nonseekable): Renamed/adapted from tac_stdin.
	(tac_file): Get fd via `open' directly rather than via fopen/fileno,
	since we never used the stream.  Perform "-" to stdin mapping here
	rather than in main.  Determine whether a file is seekable,
	by trying to `lseek' to its end, and dispatch to tac_seekable or
	tac_nonseekable accordingly.
	(main): Rewrite argument handling now that it uses only tac_file.
	* NEWS: Mention it here.

2004-10-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/leak-fd: New file.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	* tests/rm/dot-rel: New file.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	Correct my patch of 2004-10-18.
	* src/remove.c (rm): Destroy the saved_cwd here (via cwd_state),
	if necessary, not in remove_dir.  Otherwise, removing multiple
	`.'-relative nonempty directories no longer worked.

2004-10-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/fmt.c (usage): Improve description of --prefix.
	Problem reported by Edward Welbourne.

	* man/uniq.x: Change summary so that it doesn't imply that
	uniq writes to its input file.  Problem reported by
	Dan Jacobson.

2004-10-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Plug a leak that would cause a cross-device mv to fail when
	operating on too many command-line-specified nonempty directories.
	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Destroy the `struct saved_cwd' on the
	top of the stack before returning.  This usually closes the file
	descriptor that was used to return to the original working directory.
	Reported by Cyril Bouthors in
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/3048
	* NEWS: Mention it here.

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_file_name): Give a more descriptive
	diagnostic when pathconf fails.  This also avoids an unwarranted
	warning from gcc-3.3.5 about a format not being a string literal.

	* src/sleep.c (main): Remove declaration of unused local, c.
	* src/printenv.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/logname.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/uptime.c (main): Likewise, for optc.
	* src/tsort.c (main): Likewise, for opt.

2004-10-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* AUTHORS: Add self to pathchk.
	* src/pathchk.c (AUTHORS): Add self.
	Change "path" to "file name" whenever possible.
	Remove usage comment, as it was a duplication of the code or doc.
	Include <wchar.h> if available.
	(mbrlen, mbstate_t) [! (HAVE_MBRLEN && HAVE_MBSTATE_T)]: Define.
	(NEED_PATHCONF_WRAPPER, PATH_MAX, PATH_MAX_FOR, NAME_MAX,
	pathconf_wrapper, portable_chars, dir_ok): Remove.
	(NAME_MAX_MINIMUM, PATH_MAX_MINIMUM): New macros.
	(pathconf, _PC_NAME_MAX, _PC_PATH_MAX): Define if nonexistent.
	(portable_chars_only): New arg FILELEN.
	Don't assume ASCII; we might be on an EBCDIC host.
	Don't assume unibyte locale in diagnostic.
	(component_start, component_len): New functions.
	(validate_file_name): Renamed from validate_path.  All uses changed.
	Pretty much a complete rewrite.
	Don't make copy of file arg.  Always append trailing slash to
	pathconf arg, just in case it's a symlink (this is pure paranoia;
	we don't know of any hosts where the trailing slash is required).
	Use size_t instead of long int when possible.
	Avoid need to call pathconf in most practical cases.
	Don't use euidaccess several times to test searchability;
	just use lstat once.  Reword diagnostic to put the (often very long)
	file names last.

2004-10-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/printf.c (usage): Mention Unicode, and use H for hex digits.

2004-10-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Mention today's fts.c fix.

2004-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2004-10-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add .flac and .mpc as audio suffixes.
	From Jesus Climent in http://bugs.debian.org/276149.

2004-10-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (ignore_mode): Renamed from ignore, to avoid shadowing
	problems.  All uses changed.

2004-10-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* .x-sc_trailing_blank: Add an exclusion for config/texinfo.tex,
	since Karl says its trailing blanks are there to stay :-)

2004-10-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/expr.c (NEW, OLD): Remove, partly to avoid
	reference to obsolescent macro XMALLOC.
	All uses replaced by xmalloc and free.

2004-09-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (usage): Clarify: --retry works only with --follow=name.
	Reported by Nik A. Melchior in http://bugs.debian.org/273781.

2004-09-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/od.c (format_address_paren): c is optional, so don't output
	it if it's '\0'.

2004-09-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Add support for ls --hide.  Idea suggested by Bardur Arantsson.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/ls.c (file_ignored): Renamed from file_interesting, with
	inverted return value.  Accept the file name, not a struct dirent *.
	All uses changed.  Avoid the expense of calling fnmatch if the
	file is ignorable due to leading '.'.
	(all_files, really_all_files): Removed; replaced by:
	(ignore): New variable.  All uses changed.
	(IGNORE_DEFAULT, IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT, IGNORE_MINIMAL, HIDE_OPTION):
	New constants.
	(hide_patterns): New variable.
	(long_options, decode_switches, file_ignored, usage):
	Add support for --hide.
	(patterns_match): New function.
	(usage): Replace "hide" with "ignore" in explanation, to avoid
	confusion.

2004-09-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file, print_long_format): Don't assume that
	human-readable output has a byte count equal to its column width;
	this isn't always true in locales where the radix character is not
	'.' or ','.
	(format_user_or_group): Revamp code to match the above fix;
	this avoids the (very faint) possibility of integer overflow.

2004-09-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Mention that "chmod -r -w x" now works as expected.
	* src/chmod.c (main): Revamp option processing to support this.
	* tests/chmod/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add 'usage'.
	* tests/chmod/usage: New set of tests for usage like that.

2004-09-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (CVS_LIST): Use --types=AFGM option so that

	sc_prohibit_jm_in_m4, sc_system_h_headers, sc_sun_os_names,

	nonstandard "cvsu --list".

	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolete_option): Bring back support
	for obsolete option followed by non-obsolete, or by more
	than one file.  When obsolete, conform to SUSv2 rather than

	"tail -c".  Add support for the SUSv2 "b" modifier.
	* NEWS: Mention the above.
	* tests/tail/Test.pm: New test case obs-b to check the above.
	err-[134] no longer need _POSIX2_VERSION=199209.

2004-09-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/echo.c (main): Don't pass NULL to strcmp when
	POSIXLY_CORRECT and given no arguments.

	* src/md5sum.c (STRING_OPTION): Remove.
	(long_options, main): Remove support for undocumented and
	obsolete --string option, as suggested in the 1996-09-26 patch.
	* NEWS: Document this.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Don't try to remove writeable files in a
	sticky /tmp directory, as SVR4-like systems (e.g., Solaris 9) let

2004-09-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/md5sum.c (STATUS_OPTION, STRING_OPTION): New enums.
	(long_options, main): Use them instead of magic numbers 2 and 1.
	For --string, optarg can't possibly be NULL.

	(scanargs): Don't mess with argc, argv; getopt_long handles this now.
	Say "operands" for operands, not "options".
	(main): Use getopt_long, so that "dd --" works as POSIX requires.
	* tests/dd/misc: Check for "dd --".

	* src/chroot.c (main): Reject unknown options instead of
	interpreting them as a directory to chroot to.

	* src/cksum.c: Remove obsolete comment about POSIX 1003.2/D11.2.
	The current standard (POSIX 1003.1-2004) is correct.
	(crc_remainder) [defined CRCTAB]: Renamed from "remainder" to avoid
	collision with builtin function.
	(main) [defined CRCTAB]: Output in lowercase hexadecimal, and
	output the first 0 as 8 digits, to make it easier to compare to
	the text of the standard.  Output crctab to be a const array.

2004-09-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: "tail" now handles obscure POSIX 1003.2-1992 cases better.
	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolete_option): Renamed from
	parse_obsolescent_option, since the options are obsolete now.
	Remove bool *arg; just exit if there's an error.  Revamp to follow
	POSIX 1003.2-1992 more precisely, to handle cases like "tail -
	file" and "tail -10 -- file" correctly when we are conforming to
	the older standard.
	(main): Adjust to this change.
	* tests/tail/Test.pm (test_vector): minus-* requires
	_POSIX2_VERSION=199209 now, to work correctly if there is
	an input file.  err-1 and err-3 no longer errors if there
	is another file.

2004-09-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/tr/Test.pm (fowler-1): New test case.

2004-09-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/touch.c (main): Fix POSIX-conformance bug: "touch --
	MMDDhhmm file" must be treated like "touch MMDDhhmm file" when
	conforming to pre-2001 POSIX.
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* tests/touch/obsolescent: Test for this bug.  Also, set
	_POSIX2_VERSION=199209 and POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 so that it's
	a better test for obsolescent features.

	* src/sort.c (main): Emulate Solaris 8 and 9 "sort -y", so that
	"sort -y abc" is like "sort abc" whereas "sort -y 100" is like
	plain "sort".

	* src/od.c: Several changes for POSIX and FreeBSD compatibility.
	(COMMON_SHORT_OPTIONS): Add -B, -D, -e, -F, -H, -I, -L, -O, -s, -X.
	(long_options, main): --strings is now -S, not -s.
	(usage): Reflect the usage changes.
	(parse_old_offset): Do not issue a diagnostic on failure;
	callers now do this as necessary.
	(main): Support POSIX syntax.  Remove unused case 0 from getopt_long.
	Add support for new short options (many undocumented) for
	compatibility with FreeBSD.  Remove FIXME for -s; it's now
	POSIX-compatible.  Default format is now oS, not o2.
	* NEWS: Describe the above.

2004-09-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/stty.c (valid_options): Remove.

	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-08/msg00189.html
	(human_fstype): Add ramfs, squashfs, sysfs.
	Reported by Pozsar Balazs in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-08/msg00188.html
	(human_fstype): Return char const *, not char *.

	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-08/msg00171.html
	* src/paste.c (dummy_closed, CLOSED, dummy_endlist, ENDLIST): Remove;
	it's not portable C to assume FILE is a complete type.
	(paste_parallel): Use index test instead of ENDLIST, and NULL
	instead of CLOSED.

2004-08-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	(parse_tab_stop): Renamed from parse_tabstop.  All uses changed.
	(validate_tab_stop): Renamed from validate_tabstop.  All uses changed.

	(expand): Remove unnecessary casts.
	Add another loop nesting level, for lines, so that per-line variables

	Revamp tab checking.  Check for write error immediately, rather
	than just once at the end of the program.
	* src/unexpand.c: Lkewise (for the expand.c changes).
	(TAB_STOP_SENTINEL): Remove.
	(tab_size): Now size_t, not uintmax_t, since we need to store
	the sequences of blanks.
	(max_column_width): New var.
	(usage): Say "blank" where POSIX requires this.
	(add_tab_stop): Calculate maximum column width.
	(unexpand): Store the pending blanks, instead of merely counting them.

	Add blanks-1 through blanks-13.

2004-08-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: "chown : file", "chown '' file", and "chgrp '' file" now
	succeed without changing the uid and gid, like FreeBSD.
	* src/chgrp.c (parse_group): Return gid_t rather than storing it
	through a pointer.  Treat "chgrp '' file" as a no-op change,
	as FreeBSD does.
	(main): Set chopt.group_name to NULL if the group is the empty
	string.
	* src/chown-core.c (describe_change): Describe changes to -1:-1
	without using "to OWNERSHIP" phrase.

2004-08-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): When preserving links, unlink
	a destination with link count greater than one.  This is so
	that commands like "cp -a" don't get confused when copying into
	a destination that already contains many hard links.  Problem
	reported by Tim Waugh in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-08/msg00053.html

	A null file arg means standard output.
	(main): "-o -" means to write to a file named "-",
	not to standard output.
	* src/tee.c (usage, tee): "tee -" writes to standard output, not
	to a file named "-".

2004-08-10  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* src/install.c (change_timestamps): Fix int->bool conversion
	bugs introduced on 2004-07-29.

2004-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/shred.c (wipename): Work even if the directory is writeable

	(main): Remove now-obsolete initialization of xalloc_fail_func.

	* src/md5sum.c: Adjust to sha->sha1 renaming.

	Define to a concatenation of string literals, not to an expression;
	needed for concatenation contexts.
	(INTMAX_MAX, INTMAX_MIN): New macros.

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Don't assume st_ino / st_dev fits in
	unsigned long; this isn't true for st_ino on Solaris 9.

2004-08-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/uname.c: Do not depend on HAVE_SYSCTL when deciding
	whether to include files.  Include <sys/param.h> if
	HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H (not HAVE_SYSCTL).
	(main) [defined __POWERPC__]: Add a kludge to work around a
	Mac OS X bug, so that uname -p defaults to "powerpc" if
	sysctl ((int[]) {CTL_HW, HW_MACHINE_ARCH}, 2, buffer, &bufsize, 0, 0)
	fails.  Problem reported by Petter Reinholdtsen in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2003-02/msg00201.html

	* src/whoami.c (main): Print uids using unsigned long int, not
	unsigned int.

	* src/unexpand.c: Int cleanup and minor reorganization to be more
	like src/expand.c.
	Include quote.h, xstrndup.h.

	(add_tabstop, parse_tabstops, main): Don't reserve UINTMAX_MAX
	as a tab stop.

	(main): 0 -> STDIN_FILENO.
	* src/uname.c (print_element): Use bool for booleans.

	* src/test.c (TRUE, FALSE, SHELL_BOOLEAN, TRUTH_OR, TRUTH_AND):
	Remove.  All uses replaced by C99 boolean primitives.
	(TEST_TRUE, TEST_FALSE): New constants, for readability.
	(test_unop, binop, unary_operator, binary_operator, two_arguments,
	three_arguments, posixtest, expr, term, and, or, is_int, age_of,
	one_argument, main): Use bool for booleans.

2004-07-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/cat.c (exit_status): Remove.  Now done by passing a boolean
	'ok' flag around.
	(simple_cat, cat): Return true if successful.  All callers changed.
	(simple_cat, cat, main): Use bool for booleans.
	(simple_cat): Use size_t for sizes.
	(cat, main): Use the same names for parameters that we use for
	long options, to avoid confusion.  This inverts the sense of the
	show_tabs (formerly output_tabs) and number_nonblank
	(formerly numbers_at_empty_lines) variables.
	(main): Don't mess up (due to integer overflow) if we are given
	INT_MAX - INT_MIN + 1 options.
	[O_BINARY]: Don't invoke isatty unless the other options require it.
	(main): When deciding whether to use simple_cat, don't worry
	about binary option; it's irrelevant.

	* src/dcgen: Remove comments, trailing white space, and empty
	lines from the output strings, to save space.
	Use a narrower type like 'unsigned char' for line lengths, if
	that will do.
	Make the output variables static, not extern.

	* src/chgrp.c (parse_group): Require base 10 when parsing
	groups as integers.
	(main): int -> bool when appropriate.
	* src/chown.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/chown-core.c: Include inttostr.h.
	(UINT_MAX_DECIMAL_DIGITS, uint_to_string): Remove.
	(gid_to_name, uid_to_name): Use imaxtostr/umaxtostr
	instead of uint_to_string).
	(describe_change): Instead of an int flag, use a char *
	auxiliary; this avoids the need for casts.
	Assume free (NULL) works.
	(change_file_owner): Return true/false, not 0/-1, since
	we don't set errno.  All callers changed.
	Use bool when appropriate.
	(chown_files): Likewise.
	* src/chown-core.h (chown_files): Likewise.

	* tests/chown/basic: Test for proper handling of uids like
	"010", which must be parsed as decimal.

	* tests/misc/pwd: Don't assume that Perl's getpwd agrees with our
	pwd when there are multiple names for the working directory
	(which can happen with an automounter, sigh).

	* src/Makefile.am ($(SCRIPTS)): Don't depend on Makefile;
	this causes Solaris 8 'make' to refuse to build "groups".
	(localedir.h): Don't depend on Makefile: this causes Solaris
	8 'make' to build localedir.h unnecessarily.  The dependence
	on Makefile is ineffective anyway, since $(localedir) might
	change even if Makefile hasn't.

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): If we can't save the state of the
	working directory, pretend we started from "/", not ".".
	This avoids a bug on hosts like Solaris that don't let you
	remove the working directory.

2004-07-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/printf.c (strtiomax, strtoumax): Declare if not already
	declared: this fixes a portability bug with Solaris 8 + GCC.
	(STRTOX): Parenthesize use of macro arg as expression.
	(vstrtoimax, vstrtoumax, vstrtold): Remove now-unnecessary
	parentheses.
	* configure.ac: Check for declaration of strtoumax, for
	src/printf.c.

	* src/Makefile.am (cp_LDADD, ginstall_LDADD, mv_LDADD,
	pathchk_LDADD, rm_LDADD, test_LDADD): New vars, for eaccess.

	* tests/readlink/can-e: Don't assume that we can remove the
	working directory: this isn't possible under Solaris 8, say.
	* tests/readlink/can-f: Likewise.
	* tests/readlink/can-m: Likewise.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): find_backup_file_name no longer
	returns NULL, so don't bother to check for this.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c (do_link): Likewise.

2004-07-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/nice.c (GET_NICE_VALUE): Renamed from GET_PRIORITY.
	All uses changed.
	(NZERO): New macro, if system doesn't define it already.
	(usage): Distinguish priorities from nice values.
	Don't assume NZERO is 20.
	(main): Use bool instead of int where appropriate.
	If user specifies an adjustment out of range, always truncate it
	to an inrange value instead of sometimes giving an error message
	and sometimes not.
	Do not assume that -1 is an error return from "nice" or
	"getpriority", as it might be the current nice value minus NZERO.
	If nice/setpriority fails with errno == EPERM, go ahead and run
	the command anyway; POSIX requires this.

	* src/pathchk.c: Include euidaccess.h.
	(dir_ok): Use euidaccess, not access.
	* src/test.c (R_OK, W_OK, X_OK, FOK): Remove; system.h defines them.
	(eaccess): Remove.  All users changed to use euidaccess instead.

2004-07-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/uptime.c (print_uptime) [defined BOOT_MSG]:
	Don't assume ut_line is null-terminated.
	* src/who.c (print_line): New arguments USERLEN and LINELEN,
	since USER and LINE might not be null terminated.  All callers
	changed.

2004-07-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug with "tail -f" reported by Rob Holland in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-07/msg00054.html>.
	Also, remove the undocumented and unsupported-since-2000
	--max-consecutive-size-changes options.  Fix another related bug:
	"tail" got confused if stdin, stdout, or stderr were closed.
	Also, use output buffering even with "tail -f".

	* NEWS: Document this, plus yesterday's patch.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tail invocation): "size has remained the same"
	-> "file has not changed", which is more accurate for fifos.
	* src/tail.c: Include fcntl-safer.h.
	(COPY_TO_EOF): Set to UINTMAX_MAX, not OFF_T_MAX (which was wrong).
	(COPY_A_BUFFER): New macro.
	(struct File_spec): New members mtime, mode, blocking.
	Remove member n_consecutive_size_changes.
	(DEFAULT_MAX_N_CONSECUTIVE_SIZE_CHANGES,
	max_n_consecutive_size_changes_between_opens,
	MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SIZE_CHANGES_OPTION): Remove.
	(long_options, tail_forever, parse_options):
	Remove (non-)support for --max-consecutive-size-changes.
	(record_open_fd): New function.
	(recheck, tail_file): Use it.  Don't assume that stdin is open.
	(dump_remainder): Add support for new COPY_A_BUFFER special value.
	Treat errno==EAGAIN like EOF, since it might be a nonblocking read.
	(recheck): New arg BLOCKING, specifying whether to use blocking reads.
	All uses changed.
	(n_live_files): Remove, replacing with...
	(any_live_files): New function.  All uses changed.
	(tail_forever): Use nonblocking I/O unless we know that blocking I/O
	is safe; this avoids some hangs when reading from a fifo.
	Avoid invoking fstat or sleep when using blocking I/O.
	Do not check for changes to size if the file is not a regular file,
	as the size is undefined in that case.
	Check for changes to mtime or mode, too; this works for non-regular
	files.
	(tail_forever, main): Redo fflush strategy to work even when input
	is nonblocking.  Don't use unbuffered output; just flush when needed.

2004-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/tail.c (main): Ignore -f if no file operand is specified
	and standard input is a pipe.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tail invocation): Do not ignore -f for
	all pipes, just for when standard input is a pipe and no
	file operand is specified.
	* tests/tail/Test.pm: Reinstate f-1 test, since we now pass.
	Add a new commented-out f-2 test, which we still fail.
	(test_vector): All f-* tests are special cases, not just f-1.

2004-07-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/uptime.c: Include c-strtod.h.
	(print_uptime): Use c_strtod instead of setlocale and sscanf.
	Use long int rather than int to count days (for 64-bit hosts),
	and check for arithmetic overflow when converting double to time_t.

2004-07-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/printf.c (vstrtold): Renamed from vstrtod.
	Now returns long double.  All uses changed.
	(print_direc): Use "L" length modifier when printing floating point
	numbers, since we're now printing long double.

2004-07-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	printf cleanup, to avoid undefined behavior, to add support for
	formats that Bash supports, and to support wide integers like
	Bash does.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/printf.c (UNSPECIFIED): Remove.  All uses now replaced by
	booleans, so that we don't reserve any values for precision or
	width (like Bash).
	(STRTOX): Use prototype, not K&R-style definition.
	(vstrtoimax): Renamed from xstrtol (to avoid confusion with xstrtol
	in ../lib), with type change to intmax_t.
	All uses changed.
	(vstrtoumax): Renamed from xstrtoul, with type change to uintmax_t.
	All uses changed.
	(vstrtod): Renamed from xstrtod.  All uses changed.
	(print_direc): Use boolean arg instead of special value to indicate
	a missing precision or width.  LENGTH no longer includes
	length modifiers or conversion character.  New arg CONVERSION
	now specifies conversion character.
	Use intmax_t-width formatting for integers (like Bash).
	Add support for C99 %a, %A, %F (like Bash).
	Add support for field width with %c (POSIX requires this).
	Add a FIXME for lack of support for field width and precision
	for %b.
	Add support for '\'', '0' flags.
	Check for invalid combinations of flags, field width, precision,
	and conversion, to prevent use of undefined behavior.
	Allow multiple length modifiers, for formats like "%lld" (like Bash).
	Add support for C99 'j', 't', 'z' length modifiers (like Bash).
	In error message, output entire invalid conversion specification,
	instead of merely outputting % followed by the conversion char.
	* tests/misc/printf: Add tests for the above.

2004-04-03  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	Change "readlink -f" to be more compatible with prior implementations.
	Add more canonicalize options, -e and -m.
	Add comprehensive tests for all readlink modes.

	* m4/canonicalize.m4 (AC_FUNC_CANONICALIZE_FILE_NAME):
	Do not add canonicalize.c here.

	* src/readlink.c (longopts): Add new options.
	(usage): Document them.
	(canonicalize_fname): New proxy function.
	(main): Handle new options.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (readlink invocation): Document new
	"readlink -f" behaviour and new canonicalize options, -e and -m.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add tests/readlink/Makefile.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add readlink.
	* tests/readlink/Makefile.am: New file.
	* tests/readlink/{rl-1,can-e,can-f,can-m}: New readlink tests.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Remove basic readlink test.
	* tests/misc/readlink: Remove file.

2004-07-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Add a FIXME comment.

2004-07-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/copy.c (copy_dir): Assume path_concat returns non-NULL.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (movefile): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (make_path_private): 2nd arg is now size_t, not int,
	to avoid problem when path_concat dir name is longer than 2 GiB (!).

	* src/nohup.c (main): Don't pass NULL first argument to path_concat.
	This cleans up the semantics a bit, as we no longer try to open the
	same file twice.

2004-07-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Add short names -t and -T for --target-directory
	and --no-target-directory options, respectively.

	* src/cp.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION, TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION):
	Remove.  All uses changed to 'T' and 't', respectively.
	* src/install.c, src/ln.c, src/mv.c: Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (long_opts, usage, do_copy, main): Add -t and -T as
	aliases for --target-directory and --no-target-directory,
	respectively.
	* src/install.c (long_options, main, usage): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c, src/mv.c: Likewise.

2004-07-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_file_system): New target.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	.x-sc_file_system: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add it.

	* man/sync.x: Use "file system" rather than "filesystem".
	* man/stat.x, man/df.x: Likewise.

2004-06-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/df.c (usage, main): Output "file system" rather than
	"filesystem".
	* src/du.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/stat.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/stat.c (long_options, usage): Rename "--filesystem" to
	"--file-system".  But keep the old name around, for compatibility
	reasons.

2004-06-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Add support for --no-target-directory option.

	* NEWS: Document it.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Common options, Target directory, cp
	invocation, install invocation, mv invocation, ln invocation):
	Likewise.
	(link invocation): Explain how to rewrite link using ln now
	that we have --no-target-directory.
	(ln invocation): Explain that --no-target-directory subsumes
	--no-dereference.
	(unlink invocation): Modify wording to match new wording in
	link invocation.

	* src/cp.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION): New constant.
	(long_opts, usage, do_copy, main): Add support for
	--no-target-directory,
	* src/install.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION, long_options, main,
	usage): Likewise.
	* src/ln.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION, long_options, usage,
	main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (NO_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION, long_options, usage,
	main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (enum): Sort values.

2004-06-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't let verbose-mode output from a subshell obscure actual differences.
	* tests/rm/inaccessible: Turn off command-echoing just before
	invoking subshell, then turn it back on if VERBOSE=yes afterward.

2004-06-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Add support for 'install --target-directory', an option
	that has been documented for years but not implemented (!).
	* doc/coreutils.texi (install invocation): Document
	--target-directory in synopsis, too.
	* src/install.c (TARGET_DIRECTORY_OPTION): New var.
	(long_options, main, usage): Add --target-directory.
	(target_directory_operand): New function, stolen from mv.c.
	(main): Use it.  Check for -d and --target-directory.
	Alter wording of diagnostics to match other programs.

2004-06-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (usage): Fix copy+paste error in description of
	--target-directory: s/move/copy/.  From Paul Jarc.

2004-06-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Use more-consistent rules among cp, ln, and mv when dealing with
	last operands that are (or look like) directories.

	* src/cp.c (target_directory_operand): New, nearly-common function,
	It reports an error if the destination appears to be a directory
	(e.g., because it has a trailing slash) but is not.
	* src/ln.c, src/mv.c: Likewise.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Use it.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Don't assume argc is positive.
	Don't bother to lstat dest, since copy() will do that for us.
	Use "const" to avoid the need for cast.

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Don't output a usage message because of file
	problems (e.g., an operand is not a directory).  Use it only for
	syntax.  Standardize on "target %s is not a directory" for the
	diagnostic.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Remove test for trailing slash, since
	target_directory_operand now does this.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (movefile): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (main): Reject multiple target directories.
	Check whether a specified target is a directory when parsing the
	options, using stat.  This gives more-accurate diagnostics.
	* src/ln.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/ln.c (isdir): Remove decl; no longer needed.
	* src/mv.c (isdir, lstat): Likewise.

	* src/ln.c (do_link): New arg dest_is_dir.  All uses changed.
	Don't check the destination ourself; rely on dest_is_dir.
	This way we can avoid lstatting the destination in the
	usual case, and in the worst case we lstat 1, not 3 times.
	Don't bother to unlink unless link failed; this saves a syscall.
	Remove unnecessary backup_succeeded flag;
	it was identical to "dest_backup != NULL".

	* src/ln.c (main): Use int to count to argc, not unsigned int.
	This handles negative operand counts.
	* src/mv.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/mv.c (do_move): Don't call hash_init; expect the caller to
	do it, for consistency with cp.c and ln.c.  All callers changed.
	(movefile): dest_is_dir parameter is now bool, not int.
	(main): Standardize on "missing destination file operand after %s"
	for the diagnostic, for consistency with cp.c.

	* tests/mv/diag: Don't assume "mv --target=nonexistentdir"
	will complain about the arg count.
	Adjust to new (briefer) diagnostics.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Add a test to verify that we get the new
	diagnostic when failing to copy through a symlink-to-inaccessible-dir.

2004-06-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix a bug: formerly, if d/x was a directory and x a file, "ln x
	d/" incorrectly created a link d/x/x.  It also saves some system
	calls.

	* NEWS: Document the fix.

	* src/ln.c (main): Don't append basename to dest if this
	results in an existing directory name.
	* tests/ln/misc: See whether a trailing slash is followed too far.

2004-06-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/printf.c (main): When given no arguments, print the standard
	"missing operand\nTry printf --help..." message -- to be consistent.

2004-06-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/mknod.c (main): Add \n at the end of message output via fprintf.

2004-06-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ln/misc: Add test for ln subscript error.

2004-06-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Remove unnecessary call to lstat.
	(main): Avoid subscript error when the destination is "".

2004-06-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/*: Replace all occurrences of `(exit N); exit' with
	`(exit N); exit N'.  Otherwise, those many tests could exit with
	improper exit status when exiting via e.g., a trapped interrupt.
	Thanks to a report from Bob Proulx.

2004-06-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/who.c (idle_string, print_user): New arg boottime,
	specifying the most recent boot time.  All uses changed.
	(idle_string) Consider a line to be "old" if it hasn't been used
	since the last boot time.  Watch out for overflow when computing
	times, and for times in the future.
	(idle_string): Record latest boot time.

2004-06-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c (usage): Correct description of `-t FD'.  The file
	descriptor, FD, is no longer optional.  Reported by Ton Nijkes.

2004-06-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	The 2004-06-19 fix for who and pinky was incomplete, as ctime
	has undefined behavior if the year precedes -999 or follows 9999.
	Since we have to stop using ctime anyway, we might as well use
	strftime and fix the FIXME, and support internationalized dates.

	* NEWS: Document the new behavior.
	* src/who.c: Include "hard-locale.h".
	(time_format, time_format_width): New vars.
	(time_string, print_line): Use them.
	(main): Set them.
	(time_string): Use localtime + strftime instead of
	ctime, to avoid problems with years before -999 or after 9999.
	* src/pinky.c: Likewise.

2004-06-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug: GNU 'ls' didn't count columns correctly if user or group
	names contained multibyte characters where the column count
	differed from the byte count.  This patch also corrects
	some comments.

	* src/ls.c (format_user_or_group): New function, which counts
	columns correctly.
	(format_user, format_group): Use it.
	(format_user_or_group_width): New function, which counts columns
	correctly.
	(format_user_width, format_group_width): Use it.

2004-06-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/priv-check: Quote "$PATH" in PATH=$PATH.
	Suggestion from Andreas Schwab.

	* tests/priv-check: When running as root, be sure to propagate
	PATH through to the process we exec as non-root.
	Reported by michael@aplatform.com.

	* src/mknod.c (main): Don't segfault when calculating the
	expected number of operands for `mknod NAME'.

2004-06-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (input_seek_errno): Declare file-scoped variable as static.

2004-06-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/basename.c (main):
	Standardize on the diagnostics given when someone gives
	too few operands ("missing operand after `xxx'") or
	too many operands ("extra operand `xxx'").
	Include "quote.h" and/or "error.h" if it wasn't already being included.

2004-06-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Don't dump core if ctime returns NULL; this is possible on
	hosts with 64-bit time_t and 32-bit int.
	* src/who.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(time_string): If ctime fails, print the raw time as an integer
	instead of dumping core.
	* src/pinky.c: Likewise, as follows:
	Include "inttostr.h".
	(time_string): New function, copied from who.c.
	(print_entry): Use it.

2004-06-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/who.c (print_line): Don't truncate user names at 8 bytes.
	Problem reported by Guido Leenders in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-06/msg00056.html
	* NEWS: document this.

2004-06-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (case_GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Switch back to
	using GNU_PACKAGE (from PACKAGE) once again.  This restores
	`GNU' to the parenthesized package name in --version output.
	Before, the first argument from AC_INIT, `GNU coreutils', would
	be propagated to the PACKAGE variable.	Now, `GNU ' is trimmed.
	Reported by Richard Stallman.

2004-06-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tr.c (to_uchar): Rename function from `uchar'.  The latter
	would clash with a typedef in Tru64's <sys/types.h>.  From Albert Chin.

2004-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Remove more special cases for POSIXLY_CORRECT when POSIX
	allows the GNU behavior.  "--" is now supported by chroot, hostid,
	hosname, pwd, sync, yes.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (yes invocation, false invocation,

2004-06-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Remove special cases for POSIXLY_CORRECT when POSIX allows
	the GNU behavior.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (pr invocation, unlink invocation): Document this.
	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Pay attention to TABSIZE even if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.  POSIX reserves upper-case environment
	variables to the implementation, so it's OK for ls to depend on
	TABSIZE.
	* src/pr.c: Include "hard-locale.h".
	(main): When in a non-POSIX locale, ignore POSIXLY_CORRECT, since
	POSIX specifies the behavior only in the POSIX locale.
	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Support \x, \u, \U even if POSIXLY_CORRECT,
	since POSIX says the behavior is unspecified here.
	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolescent_option): Support multiple file operands
	even if POSIXLY_CORRECT, since POSIX does not require a diagnostic.
	* src/printf.c (main): Recognize --help, --version even if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT.  POSIX does not specify any options, but it
	does not prohibit options either, so "printf" is like "expr" here.
	* src/unlink.c (main): Likewise.

	Instead, include "euidaccess.h".

2004-06-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/who.c (PIDSTR_DECL_AND_INIT): Don't assume pid_t fits in int.
	(UT_ID) [!HAVE_STRUCT_XTMP_UT_ID]: Remove bogus comment,
	as (sizeof "??") reliably returns 3.
	(print_line): Guard against idle and pid being too long
	(which is possible when printing headers).
	(print_user): Allocate enough bytes for idlestr.  Use IDLESTR_LEN.
	Avoid unnecessary cast of sizeof to int.
	(make_id_equals_comment): Do not assume that UT_ID returns
	a string; it might return a non-null-terminated array.
	Use strncat instead.  It's not very often where strncat is
	exactly what you want, but this is one of those rare cases.

2004-06-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/who.c (list_entries_who): Don't output a trailing space.

2004-06-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/touch.c (usage): Improve wording in description of the
	--time=WORD option.  Reported by Dan Jacobson.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Change names of parameters
	old_uid and old_gid to required_uid and required_gid respectively.

	* src/chmod.c (mode_changed): Return false, not 0, now that the
	function returns `bool'.

2004-06-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Adjust chmod and chown to be similar if -c or -v are given.  In
	particular, a no-op chown is no longer reported as a change; this
	reverts to previous behavior.  Also, fix both commands so that -v
	report failures even if the failure is not due to the chmod or
	chown syscalls.

	* src/chmod.c (CH_NOT_APPLIED): New constant.
	(describe_change): Handle it.
	(process_file): Use it, if a symlink wasn't changed.
	(mode_changed): Return bool, not int.  Accept new argument
	NEW_MODE; all callers changed.  This lets us avoid statting the
	file unless the new mode has unusual bits.
	(process_file): Return -1 on error.  With -v, report all errors
	verbosely, not just some.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Return -1 on error, not
	1 sometimes and -1 on others.  Our caller ORs together our results,
	and (-1 | 1) == 0 on ones-complement hosts.
	With -v report all errors verbosely, not just some.
	Fix bug when chopt->root_dev_ino && !chopt->affect_symlink_referent:
	file_stats wasn't set properly in that case.

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Adjust to above changes.

2004-05-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Test that chgrp -h does not fail on
	symlinks, even on hosts where that's not supported.
	Test that if -R is specified without -H or L, -h is assumed.
	Test that chown() is not optimized away.

2004-05-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Several fixes to chgrp and chown for compatibility with POSIX and BSD:

	  Check for incompatible options.  When -R and --dereference are
	  both used, then either -H or -L must also be used.  When -R and -h
	  are both used, then -P must be in effect.

	  -H, -L, and -P have no effect unless -R is also specified.
	  If -P and -R are both specified, -h is assumed.

	  Do not optimize away the chown() system call when the file's owner
	  and group already have the desired value.  This optimization was
	  incorrect, as it failed to updated the last-changed time and reset
	  special permission bits, as POSIX requires.

	  Do not report an error if the owner or group of a
	  recursively-encountered symbolic link cannot be updated because
	  the file system does not support it.

	* NEWS: Document the above.

	* src/chgrp.c (main): Check for incompatible options.  -R --dereference
	requires either -H or -L, and -R -h requires -P.  If -H, specify
	FTS_PHYSICAL as well as FTS_COMFOLLOW; this is faster.  Make this
	file as much like chown.c as possible.
	* src/chown.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Use ent->fts_statp only if
	needed.  Chown a directory only after chowning its children; this
	avoids problems if the new directory ownership doesn't permit
	access to the children.  Dereference symlinks before doing
	ROOT_DEV_INO_CHECK, not after, so that we catch symlinks to /.
	Do not optimize away the chown() system call when the file's owner
	and group already have the desired value.  POSIX does not permit
	this optimization.  Rely on chown and lchown to do the right
	thing with symlinks and/or -1 arguments, now that we have wrappers
	to do this.  Use ENOTSUPP not ENOSYS, and ignore all ENOTSUPP
	errors, not just command-line errors.
	(chown_files): Pass FTS_NOSTAT to xfts_open if we don't need file status.

	* src/system.h (ENOTSUP): Remove.

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Use chown --from to discover whether the
	group changed, since chgrp now changes unconditionally.  This
	complicates the sed script a bit.  Do not specify --dereference,
	since it's the default (and we want to test this).  Adjust output
	to match the fact that chgrp no longer optimizes the case of
	changing a file's group to the same value as before.
	* tests/chgrp/posix-H: Do not attempt to combine -h and -H; these
	options are incompatible, and their behavior is undefined with POSIX.
	(changed, not_changed): Adjust to match the fact that -h is no longer
	specified.  Sort names.
	* tests/chown/deref: Adjust error-diagnostic spelling to match new
	behavior.

2004-06-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/uname.c (main): Fix typo introduced on 2003-05-10 that
	prevented a diagnostic of any operands.

2004-06-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c (direct_mode): Turn it on/off with directio, too.

2004-06-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Enable direct-mode I/O (bypassing the buffer cache), if possible.
	Prompted by a suggestion from Kalle Olavi Niemitalo
	in http://bugs.debian.org/207035.
	* src/shred.c (direct_mode): New function.
	(do_wipefd): Turn on direct-mode I/O.
	(dopass): If a file's first write fails with EINVAL,
	turn off direct-mode I/O and retry the write.

2004-06-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/tr.c (main): "tr -d a b" is now a fatal error even if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.  The POSIX SYNOPSIS does not allow this
	option combination.

2004-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/shred.c (dopass): Don't subtract 1 from the offset after
	a write error.  Problem reported by Jon Peatfield in:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-06/msg00020.html

2004-06-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug reported by Buciuman Adrian in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-08/msg00105.html>
	where 'dd' created a file that was too large.  The bug was that dd
	assumed that the input file offset does not advance after a failed
	read; but POSIX says that the input file offset is undefined after
	a failed read.

	* src/dd.c (MAX_BLOCKSIZE): New macro.
	(input_seekable, input_seek_errno, input_offset,
	input_offset_overflow): New vars.
	(scanargs): Reject block sizes greater than MAX_BLOCKSIZE.
	(advance_input_offset): New function.
	(skip_via_lseek): Set errno to zero when reporting our failure,
	so that we don't report based on garbage errno.
	(skip): If fdesc is standard input, advance the input offset.
	Do not quit if reading, and if noerror was specified;
	POSIX seems to require this.
	If read fails on output file, report the earlier lseek failure
	instead; this fixes a FIXME in dd_copy.
	(advance_input_after_read_error): New function.
	(dd_copy): Use it, instead of assuming that failed reads
	do not advance the file pointer.  Advance input offset
	after nonfailed reads.  Advance only a partial block if
	the previous read (before the failed read) succeeded, and
	do not generate an output block of zeros in this case.
	(main): Determine initial input offset, seekability of input,
	and error if it wasn't seekable.

2004-06-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	rm (without -f) could hang unnecessarily when attempting to
	remove a symlink to a file on an off-line NFS-mounted partition.
	Reported by David Howells in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/124699.
	* src/remove.c (write_protected_non_symlink): New function.
	Don't invoke euidaccess on symlinks.
	(prompt): Use write_protected_non_symlink rather than using
	euidaccess directly, being careful not to call lstat twice for a file.

	Fix a bug in how the --output-delimiter=D option works with
	abutting byte or character ranges.  Reported by David Krider in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-05/msg00132.html
	* src/cut.c (print_kth): Remove special case for open-ended range.
	(set_fields): Record the range start index for an interval even
	when it abuts another interval on its low side.
	Also record the range start index of the longest right-open-interval.
	* tests/cut/Test.pm: Add tests of --output-delimiter=S with
	abutting and overlapping byte ranges.

2004-06-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Some POSIX-conformance cleanups for tr.

	* src/tr.c (posix_pedantic): Remove; no longer needed since
	we need to test this in just one place now.
	(usage): Mention -C.
	(unquote): Note that \055, \n, etc are escaped.
	Do not worry about POSIXLY_CORRECT when warning about ambiguous
	escape sequences.
	\ at end of string stands for itself.
	Do not diagnose invalid backslash escapes: POSIX says the behavior
	is unspecified in this case, so we don't need to diagnose it.
	(main): Add support for -C (currently an alias for -c).
	Do not diagnose 'tr [:upper:] [:upper:], as POSIX does not require
	a diagnostic here.
	* tests/tr/Test.pm: New tests bs-055, bs-at-end, repeat-Compl.
	Fix comment for range-a-a.

2004-05-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve the efficiency (and in one case, correctness) of code
	that reads symlinks.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't use alloca, as it can mess up
	royally if the link length is long (e.g., GNU/Hurd).  Use
	xreadlink instead, it's safer.  Don't bother to read the link if
	it's the wrong size.  Add a FIXME because this area is a bit murky
	and undocumented.
	* src/ls.c (get_link_name): Update use of xreadlink.
	* src/readlink.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Likewise.

2004-06-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/env.c (main): Prefer the notation `STREQ (a, b)'
	over `!strcmp (a, b)'.
	* src/sort.c (main, sort_buffer_size): Prefer the notation
	`STREQ (a, b)' over `strcmp (a, b) == 0'.
	* src/date.c (batch_convert): Likewise.
	* src/expr.c (nextarg): Likewise.
	* src/su.c (correct_password, restricted_shell, main): Likewise.
	* src/ptx.c (swallow_file_in_memory, main): Likewise.
	* src/test.c (binary_operator, and, or, main): Likewise.

2004-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: echo compatibility cleanup.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (echo invocation): Document the changes.
	* src/echo.c (V9_ECHO): Remove; always enabled.
	(DEFAULT_ECHO_TO_XPG): Renamed from V9_DEFAULT, so that
	we use the same naming convention as bash.  Now an enum,
	not a macro.
	(usage): Reword to mention -e/-E more accurately.
	Mention \0NNN (the POSIX syntax) rather than \NNN (nonstandard).
	(hextobin): New function.
	(main): Use bool rather than int for local vars when appropriate.
	Do not allow options if POSIXLY_CORRECT, unless we are using
	BSD semantics and the first argument is "-n".
	Don't pass unnecessary extra arg to parse_long_options.
	do_v9 now defaults to DEFAULT_ECHO_TO_XPG, not to allow_options.
	Do not look for options if !allow_options.
	Use size_t rather than int when appropriate.
	Open-code option test rather than using strrchr.
	Use faster test for "-".
	Avoid redundant argc test.
	Add support for \x, for Bash compatibility.
	Use e.g. '\a' rather than '\007', for portability to EBCDIC hosts.
	When '\c' is encountered, stop printing immediately, as POSIX
	requires.
	Add support for \xhh syntax.
	Add support for \0ooo syntax; POSIX requires this.

2004-06-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.8b.  Regenerate dependent files.

2004-05-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am.in (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define PATH to include
	the build src/ directory -- at the front.
	($(srcdir)/$x-tests): Depend on Makefile.am.
	Use $x as the program name, except when it would be `test' (test is
	the sole program tested via mk-script that is also a shell built-in).
	In that case, use the old ../../src/$x.

2004-05-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Work around HPUX /bin/cc compiler bug that is exposed, now that
	sets are arrays of type `bool'.  More details here:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2004-05/msg00094.html
	FIXME: verify that the above URL points to the right message

	* src/tr.c (card_of_complement): Use cleaner `sizeof in_set'
	rather than `N_CHARS * sizeof(in_set[0])'.  Using HPUX's /bin/cc
	(aC++/ANSI C B3910B A.05.55 [Dec 04 2003]) on an ia64-hp-hpux11.22
	system, those two expressions are not the same (256 vs. 1024).
	The effect of this problem was that `tr -c x y' would fail:
	tr: when not truncating set1, string2 must be non-empty
	(set_initialize): Remove unnecessary initialization of the `in_set'
	buffer; that initialization triggered the same compiler bug as above.

2004-05-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tr cleanup, mostly having to do with integer type ranges.
	Remove all casts.

	* tests/tr/Test.pm: Add a few tests for the below.  Alas, most of
	the test cases wouldn't be portable, or would take too much CPU
	time, or both.

	* src/tr.c (N_CHARS, N_CHAR_CLASSES): Now an enum, not a macro.
	This is safe since the code already assumes N_CHARS fits in int.
	(Filter): Remove: we want to prototype everything.
	(ORD, CHR): Remove.  All uses removed.  Some replaced with:
	(uchar): New function.  All places where a char must be converted
	to an unsigned char are now done this way, not by ad-hoc methods.
	(count): New type.  Use it whenever counts or states are needed.
	(BEGIN_STATE): Increase from INT_MAX - 1 (which was bogus, anyway,
	since we used it in an unsigned int context) to UINTMAX_MAX - 1.
	(REPEAT_COUNT_MAXIMUM): New macro.  Use it in place of BEGIN_STATE
	whenever appropriate.
	(NOT_A_CHAR): Remove global macro; now a local enum.
	(UL_LOWER, UL_UPPER, UL_NONE): No longer specify values, since
	the rest of the code no longer depends on them.
	(class_ok): Remove; all uses changed to use inline comparisons.
	(RE_NO_TYPE): Remove; wasn't used or needed.
	(struct List_element): normal_char and equiv_code are now unsigned
	char, not int.
	first_char, last_char, and the_repeated_char are now unsigned char,
	not unsigned int.  repeat_count is now count, not size_t.
	All uses changed.
	(struct Spec_list): state is now count, not unsigned int.
	lengthis now count, not size_t.
	n_indefinite_repeats is now size_t, not int.
	has_equiv_class, has_char_class, and has_restricted_char_class
	are now bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(struct E_string): s is now char *, not unsigned char *.
	escaped is now bool *, not int *.  All uses changed.
	(ES_MATCH): Remove macro, replacing with:
	(es_match): New inline function.  All uses changed.
	(squeeze_repeats, complement, posix_pedantic, truncate_set1,
	translating): Now bool, not int.
	(io_buf): Now char array, not unsigned char.
	(SET_TYPE): Remove.  All uses replaced with bool.
	(is_equiv_class_member, unquote, append_range, append_char_class,
	append_equiv_class, find_closing_delim, star_digits_closebracket,
	build_spec_list, parse_str, homogeneous_spec_list):
	Now returns bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(is_equiv_class_member): Now inline.
	(is_equiv_class_member, is_char_class_member, make_printable_str,
	append_normal_char, append_range, append_repeated_char,
	get_s2_spec_stats):
	Args are now of proper integer type.
	(unquote, look_up_char_class, make_printable_str,
	append_equiv_class, build_spec_list, squeeze_filter):
	Avoid unsigned char *p; gently convert *p to unsigned char instead.
	(unquote, get_spec_stats): Do not jump past declarations and then
	use them; C doesn't allow this in portable programs.
	(make_printable_str): Check for overflow in size calculations.
	(xmemdup): Remove.  All uses rewritten.
	(find_bracketed_repeat): Args are now of proper pointer-to-integer
	type.  Do not reject [c*0].  Use xstrtoumax, not xstrtoul.
	(find_bracketed_repeat, star_digits_closebracket): Check that the
	digits are not escaped.
	(build_spec_list): Don't bother to copy opnd_str; not needed.
	(build_spec_list, get_next): Simplify internal logic a bit.
	(card_of_complement): Fix bug due to char overflow.
	(get_spec_stats): Don't assume len fits into int.
	Check for integer overflow.  Use abort() rather than assert(0).
	(string2_extend): Fix subscript error: is_char_class_member (..., 255)
	was being invoked.
	(squeeze_filter): READER is never null now; simplify code.
	READER arg now has a simpler type.  Remove unnecessary casts.
	(squeeze_filter, main): Calls to fwrite improperly checked result
	against zero, rather than against requested size.
	(plain_read): New function.
	(read_and_delete, read_and_xlate):
	Remove unused filter arg, and don't worry about hit_eof.
	Simplify by using plain_read.
	(set_initialize): Args are bool and bool *, not int and SET_TYPE *.
	(main): Always pass a non-null procedure to squeeze_filter.
	Rewrite so that class_ok isn't needed.

2004-05-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

2004-05-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	rm -r would get a failed assertion when run from an inaccessible
	directory and with two or more command line arguments including an

	* src/remove.h (struct rm_options) [require_restore_cwd]: New member.
	* src/remove.c (struct cwd_state): Define.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): Redesign interface so that a restore_cwd failure
	can be detected by the caller.  Instead of returning a malloc'd
	directory name, communicate it to caller via a new parameter, and
	return an indication of whether restore_cwd failed.  Update caller.
	Eliminate an unnecessary call to AC_stack_top.
	(remove_dir): Change type of cwd_state parameter to `struct cwd_state'
	so we can now communicate to caller whether/how functions like
	restore_cwd have failed.  Update caller.
	(rm_1): Fail if we've failed to restore the working directory
	and the name of the next file to remove is `.'-relative.
	(rm): Fail if the require_restore_cwd flag is true and we've
	failed to restore the working directory.
	* src/mv.c (rm_option_init): Initialize new member,
	x->require_restore_cwd.
	* src/rm.c (rm_option_init): Likewise.

2004-05-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/inaccessible: New test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add inaccessible.

	* src/remove.c (rm): Use free rather than XFREE.
	(remove_dir): Use xmalloc, not XMALLOC.
	(ds_init): Likewise.

2004-05-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_unmarked_diagnostics): Now that the unmarked
	diagnostics in shred.c have been fixed, don't exempt shred.c from
	this check.

	* src/shred.c: Use translatable diagnostics, e.g.
	change "%s: remove" to _("%s: failed to remove") and
	change "%s: close"  to _("%s: failed to close").

2004-05-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/shred.c (names): Bring back lower-case letters, "_", and
	".".  But continue to omit +, =, %, @, #, as they're either
	shell metacharacters (for some shells) or are not in some
	character sets, or (in the case of '%') must be a
	metacharacter somewhere.

2004-05-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Adjust to new signature of getndelim2.

2004-05-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c (incname): Decrement `len' only once per loop iteration.

	chgrp and chown now dereference symlinks by default, per POSIX.
	Reported by Michal Politowski as http://bugs.debian.org/249177.

	* src/chown-core.c (chopt_init): Affect each symlink referent by default.
	* src/chown.c (usage): Update to reflect this.
	* src/chgrp.c (usage): Likewise.
	* NEWS: Describe the change.
	Adapt tests accordingly.
	* tests/chgrp/basic: Use -h where necessary to retain semantics.
	* tests/chgrp/deref: Likewise.
	* tests/chgrp/posix-H: Likewise.

2004-05-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	In shred, check for errors from fdatasync more carefully.  If
	fdatasync fails with errno==EINVAL, it means this implementation
	does not support synchronized I/O for this file.  Do not report
	this as an error, as (for example) AIX 5.2 fdatasync reports it
	for raw disk devices.  Problem reported by Albert Chin in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2004-05/msg00028.html>.

	Check for write errors, though: the old code ignored them.
	Improve error checking in a few other cases, too (e.g., close of a
	directory).

	Also, change several 'int' values to 'bool', so that the error
	checking is a bit clearer.  Similarly, change unsigned values
	to size_t where appropriate.

	* src/shred.c: Include "dirname.h".
	(datasync) [!HAVE_FDATASYNC]: Remove.
	(dosync): New function.
	(dopass): Use it.  Return 1 on write error, -1 on other error.
	All callers changed.  Report write error if dosync does.
	(do_wipefd, wipefd, wipename, wipefile): Return bool (true/false),
	not int (0/-1).  All callers changed.  Return false if there's a
	write error.
	(incname): Return bool (true/false), not int (0/1).  Accept
	size_t length, not unsigned.  All callers changed.  Do not
	bother checking for non-digits; it can't happen.  Replace
	recursion with iteration.
	(wipename): Use dir_name, base_name, etc. instead of assuming
	Unix file names.  Use size_t for length, not unsigned.
	Report error if unlink or close fails.
	(wipename, main): Use bool for booleans.

	(names): Use only digits and uppercase letters, for greater
	portability.

2004-05-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/chown/deref: New test for the yesterday's change.
	* tests/chown/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add deref.

2004-05-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	chown --dereference did nothing when the owner/group of a
	symlink matched the desired owner/group.  Reported by David Malone.
	Also reported in 1999 as http://bugs.debian.org/39642.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): When --dereference has
	been specified, and when processing a symlink, stat it to get the
	owner and group of the referent.

2004-05-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/pwd.x, man/echo.x, man/printf.x: Fix typo:
	s/supercede/supersede/ reported by Andrew Fabbro.

2004-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Improve performance of `sort -m' on large files, at the cost of
	making some contrived examples unsafe.  POSIX allows this
	optimization.  Performance problem reported by Jonathan Baker in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-05/msg00071.html>.

	* src/sort.c (first_same_file): Do not treat input pipes
	differently from other files.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Document that "sort -m -o F"
	might write F before reading all the input.
	* NEWS: Likewise.

2004-05-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/od.c (print_ascii, dump_strings): Use e.g. '\a' rather than
	'\007', for portability to EBCDIC hosts.
	* src/printf.c (print_esc_char): Likewise.
	* src/tr.c (unquote, make_printable_str): Likewise.

2004-05-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Move lstat-`.' into if-block
	where the result is used.  This avoids one unnecessary lstat call
	per command line argument.

2004-05-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Don't assume that "make -C" works; Solaris "make" doesn't have -C.

	* src/Makefile.am (all_programs.list): New rule, copied from
	man/Makefile.am and tests/Makefile.am, except that we use the
	system tr rather than ./tr and we don't use tr -s.
	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Use it.
	* man/Makefile.am (all_programs): Likewise.  Renamed from programs,
	for consistency.  All uses changed.

2004-05-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/unread3: New test, for the above fix and today's
	lib/save-cwd.c improvement.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add unread3.

	* src/rm.c: Don't include "save-cwd.h".  It's no longer used.

2004-05-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/install/trap: New file.  Test for bug fix of 2004-04-18.
	* tests/install/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add trap.

	* src/remove.c (AD_push): Don't use errno in diagnostic about
	`changed dev/ino'.

	Remove these generated files from CVS.
	* tests/cut/cut-tests, tests/date/date-tests, tests/join/join-tests:
	* tests/ls/ls-tests, tests/pr/pr-tests, tests/tac/tac-tests:
	* tests/tail/tail-tests, tests/test/test-tests, tests/tr/range-tests:
	* tests/tr/tr-tests, tests/wc/wc-tests:

2004-05-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tr.c (unquote): Use xcalloc rather than xmalloc and
	a loop initializing the just-allocated memory to zero.

2004-05-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/no-give-up: New file; check for today's fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add no-give-up.

2004-05-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Fix bug where "rm" gave up too easily, reported by Dan Jacobsen in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-05/msg00013.html>.

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Check for errno values like ENOENT
	that show the file cannot be directory, instead of for errno
	values like EPERM that show the file might be a directory.  This
	is necessary because, when a single unlink() call has multiple
	reasons to fail, it can set errno to any of those reasons; it's
	only the rare errno value like ENOENT that excludes all the other
	possible reasons to fail even when the file is a directory.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Don't attempt chdir if the file is known
	to not be a directory.
	(remove_dir): Use the same method that remove_cwd_entries uses
	(for some reason they differed).  Don't assert that saved_errno
	must be EPERM; it might be just about anything.

2004-05-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/id.c (xgetgroups): Use xnmalloc, rather than xmalloc.
	Don't add `1' to the buffer size (it was to protect against malloc
	implementations that fail to allocate a buffer of size zero).
	That is no longer necessary, since we use a malloc wrapper
	on such systems.

	* src/wc.c (get_input_fstatus): Use xnmalloc, rather than xmalloc.
	* src/head.c (elide_tail_bytes_pipe): Likewise.
	* src/df.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (do_wipefd): Likewise.
	* src/users.c (list_entries_users): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/md5sum.c (main): Likewise.

2004-04-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/df.c (show_disk, show_point): If several filesystems are
	mounted on the same mount point, prefer the last one, not the first.
	Problem reported by Christian Jones in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-04/msg00200.html>.
	(show_disk): Remove unused statp arg.  Return bool, not int.
	(show_point): Rewrite to avoid gotos.  Use the same algorithm
	for lofs and dummies for each pass through the mount table,
	rather than subtly different algorithms (which are probably
	inadvertent).

2004-05-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add m4/ChangeLog, now that we no longer
	have m4/Makefile*.

2004-05-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	When chown or chgrp is modifying the referent of a symlink,
	use the chown(2) function, if possible.
	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Don't hard-code the
	open/fchown/close kludge here.  Use `chown' instead.
	The chown function works just fine on conforming systems.
	Other systems now go through the new chown wrapper that
	resorts to the old kludge.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Add a comment.

2004-04-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ptx.c: Make over 40 global extern variables `static'.
	(syntax_table, re_syntax_table): Remove declarations of two unused
	variables (they were exposed by the above change).

	* src/du.c (G_fail, opt_nul_terminate_output): Declare `static'.
	* src/ln.c (backup_type): Likewise.

	* src/remove.c (rm): Add `extern' keyword.
	* src/cp-hash.c (forget_created, remember_created)
	(src_to_dest_lookup, remember_copied, hash_init, forget_all): Likewise.
	* src/copy.c (dest_info_init, src_info_init, copy): Likewise.
	* src/chown-core.c (chopt_init, chopt_free, gid_to_name)
	(uid_to_name, chown_files): Likewise.

	* src/Makefile.am (sc_tight_scope): New rule.
	* Makefile.maint (sc_tight_scope): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

2004-04-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.8.4.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/sort.c (limfield): Make a comment clearer.

2004-04-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix POSIX-conformance bug: "sort -k 3,3.5b" is supposed to skip
	leading blanks when computing the location of the field end;
	it is not supposed to skip trailing blanks.  Solaris 8 "sort"
	does conform to POSIX.  Also fix the documentation to clarify
	this and related issues.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Mention -k earlier, so
	that the options are in alphabetical order.  Describe how -b works
	more-accurately; this involves fixing some examples, too.  Mention
	what happens if the start field falls after an end field or after
	a line end.  Warn about using -k without -b, -g, -M, -n, or -t.
	Add an example of how to sort IPv4 addresses and Apache Common
	Log Format dates.  Remove a duplicate example.
	(Putting the tools together): Use separate options rather
	than agglomerating them.
	* src/sort.c (limfield): Use skipeblanks, not skipsblanks, to
	decode whether to skip leading blanks.
	(trailing_blanks): Remove.
	(fillbuf, getmonth, keycompare): Don't trim trailing blanks.

	* tests/pr/Test.pm: Fix typo in env_default comment.
	* tests/sort/Test.pm: Likewise.
	(18c, 18d): Reverse the order of output lines, so that the
	test cases conform to POSIX.

2004-04-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	More signal-handling cleanup for ls.c.  Do not allow signals to
	happen between arbitrary output bytes, as the
	restore-default-color sequence can bollix up multibyte chars or
	color-change sequences in the ordinary output.  Instead, process
	signals only between printing a file name and changing the color
	back to non_filename_text color.  That way, if the signal handler
	changes the color (to the default), 'ls' will change it back when
	'ls' continues (after being suspended).

	Also, do not bother with signal-handling unless stdout is a
	controlling terminal; this lets stdio buffer better when "ls
	--color" is piped or sent to a file.

	* src/ls.c (sigprocmask, sigset_t) [!defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]: New macros.
	Do not include "full-write.h"; no longer needed.
	(tcgetpgrp) [! HAVE_TCGETPGRP]: New macro.
	(put_indicator_direct): Remove.  All callers changed to use
	put_indicator.
	(caught_signals, interrupt_signal, stop_signal_count): New vars.
	(restore_default_color): Don't bother checking for put_indicator
	failure.
	(sighandler): Don't handle SIGTSTP; that's another handler now.
	Simply set interrupt_signal to the signal, then exit.
	(stophandler, process_signals): New functions.
	(main): Don't output any color changes until _after_ the signal
	handlers are set up.  This fixes a race condition where 'ls'
	could be interrupted while initializing colors, and leaving the
	terminal in an undesirable state.
	Don't mess with signal-handling if standard output is not a
	controlling terminal.
	When exiting, restore the default color, then restore the
	default signal handling, then act on any signals that weren't
	acted on yet.
	Do not print //DIRED// etc. in colors; this avoids the need
	to catch signals when printing them.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Process signals just before switching
	color back to non_filename_text.

2004-04-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid segfault on systems for which SIZE_MAX != (size_t) -1.
	* src/ls.c (quote_name): Use SIZE_MAX, not -1, in calls
	of quotearg_buffer.  Patch by Mikulas Patocka.

2004-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	tee ignored SIGPIPE, but POSIX doesn't allow this.

	* src/tee.c (main): Do not ignore SIGPIPE, as POSIX 1003.1-2001
	does not allow this.  This undoes the 1996-10-24 patch.

2004-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Signal-handling cleanup for coreutils.  Here are the highlights:

	 - csplit sometimes failed to remove files when interrupted.
	 - csplit didn't clean up if two signals arrived nearly simultaneously.
	 - install -s would infloop on System V if SIGCHLD was ignored.
	 - ls could incorrectly restore color if multiple signals
	   arrived nearly simultaneously.

	* src/csplit.c (sigprocmask, sigset_t) [!defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]:
	Define.
	(filename_space, prefix, suffix, digits, files_created, remove_files):
	Now volatile.
	(caught_signals): New var.
	(cleanup): Block signals while deleting all files.
	(cleanup_fatal, handle_line_error, regexp_error):
	Mark with ATTRIBUTE_NORETURN.
	(create_output_file, close_output_file, interrupt_handler):
	Block signals while changing the number of output files,
	to fix some race conditions.
	(delete_all_files): Do nothing if remove_files is zero.
	Clear files_created.
	(main): Don't mess with signals until after argument processing
	is done.

	* src/csplit.c (main): Rewrite signal-catching code to make it
	similar to other coreutils programs.  When processing signals,
	block all signals that we catch, but do not block signals that we
	don't catch.  Avoid problems with unsigned int warnings.
	* src/ls.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/csplit.c (interrupt_handler):
	Use void, not (obsolete) RETSIGTYPE.
	* src/shred.c (sigill_handler, isaac_seed_machdep): Likewise.

	* src/csplit.c (interrupt_handler) [defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]:
	Use simpler "signal (sig, SIG_DFL)" rather than sigaction equivalent.
	* src/ls.c (sighandler) [defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]: Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (sighandler) [defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]: Likewise.
	* src/nohup.c (main) [!defined _POSIX_SOURCE]: Likewise, except
	for SIG_IGN.
	* src/tee.c (main) [!defined _POSIX_SOURCE]: Likewise.

	* src/install.c: Include <signal.h>.
	(main) [defined SIGCHLD]: Set SIGCHLD handler to the default, if -s is
	given, since System V fork+wait does not work if SIGCHLD is ignored.

	* src/ls.c (sighandler) [!defined SA_NOCLDSTOP]: Reset signal
	handler to self, not to SIG_IGN, since SIGTSTP can be received
	more than once.
	(main): Use SA_RESTART, as that is simpler than checking for EINTR
	failures all over the place.

2004-04-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Clarify comment.

	* man/help2man: Accept new option: --program-name=NAME, so that we
	can override the one in --version output.  This is needed solely
	so that test.1 doesn't refer to `[' as the program name.
	Reported by Benjamin Cutler as http://bugs.debian.org/205251.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Use help2man's new --program-name option.

	* src/pwd.c: Don't include pathmax.h; system.h already does it.

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Free buffer upon getndelim2 failure.

2004-04-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/shred.c (isaac_seed_start) [AVOID_USED_UNINITIALIZED_WARNINGS]:
	Initialize a buffer to avoid warnings from tools like valgrind.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_trailing_blank): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	* .x-sc_trailing_blank: New file.

	Make pwd work even if the resulting name is so long that getcwd fails.
	* src/pwd.c: (path_free, path_init, path_prepend): New functions.
	(nth_parent, find_dir_entry, robust_getcwd): New functions.
	(main): First try getcwd, then, upon failure, robust_getcwd.

2004-04-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c (print_user): Use xrealloc here, rather than
	unchecked realloc.  Remove anachronistic casts.

	* src/remove.c (full_filename_): Don't leak upon failed realloc.

	* src/system.h (readdir_ignoring_dot_and_dotdot): New inline function,
	from remove.c.
	* src/remove.c (readdir_ignoring_dotdirs): Move function to system.h,
	renaming it.  Update uses.

2004-04-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Depend on automake-1.8.3.

	* src/remove.c (ds_init, ds_free): Likewise.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_prohibit_jm_in_m4): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add to the list.

2004-04-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Use page-aligned buffers whenever we bother to do I/O using buffer
	sizes that are tailored for the files.

	* src/cat.c: Include getpagesize.h.
	* src/copy.c: Likewise.
	* src/shred.c: Likewise.
	* src/split.c: Likewise.
	* src/cat.c (main): Align I/O buffers to page boundaries.
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (dopass): Likewise.
	* src/split.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/dd.c (ROUND_UP_OFFSET, PTR_ALIGN): Remove.
	All uses replaced by ptr_align.
	* src/od.c (gcd, lcm): Remove; now in system.h.
	* src/system.h (gcd, lcm, ptr_align): New functions, moved from od.c.

2004-04-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Remove m4/Makefile.am: it's no longer needed, with newer automake
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove m4/Makefile.in from the list.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove `m4' from the list.

2004-04-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Change `jm_' in AC_DEFINE'd names to `gl_'.

2004-03-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: cp -pu and mv -u (when copying) now take the destination
	file system time stamp resolution into account.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (mv invocation): Document this.
	(cp invocation): Document -u (it was missing!) with new behavior.

	* src/copy.c: Include "utimecmp.h".
	(copy_internal): Compare time stamps using utimecmp rather than
	MTIME_CMP.

2004-04-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (.re-list): New rule/file, to replace
	hard-coded list of header file names.
	(sc_system_h_headers): Use the new file.
	Don't look for sys2.h anymore.

	* src/system.h: Include new "stat-macros.h" rather than hard-coding
	all of its macro definitions -- the list was slightly out of date.
	Suggestion from Dmitry V. Levin.

2004-04-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* NEWS: Remove noctty flag from dd.  Suggested by Philippe Troin.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (dd invocation): Likewise.
	* src/shred.c (O_NOCTTY): Remove redundant decl.
	* src/dd.c (flags, usage): Remove noctty flag.
	(main): Always use O_NOCTTY when opening files.

2004-04-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (dd_copy): Mark two diagnostics for translations.
	(set_fd_flags): Undo part of today's change: it's a little
	cleaner -- and more efficient in the common case -- to go
	ahead and OR in the -1 when fcntl fails.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_dd_max_sym_length): New target.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

	* src/md5sum.c (PROGRAM_NAME) [algorithm == ALG_SHA1]:
	Correct spelling: s/shasum/sha1sum.  Reported by Jesse Kornblum.

	* src/dd.c (set_fd_flags): Don't OR in -1 when fcntl fails.
	Rename parameter, flags, to avoid shadowing global.
	(LONGEST_SYMBOL): Tweak comment.

2004-04-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: New dd conv= symbols nocreat, excl, fdatasync, fsync,
	and new dd options iflag= and oflag=.
	* src/dd.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/Makefile.am (dd_LDADD, shred_LDADD): Add fdatasync's lib.
	* src/dd.c (fdatasync) [!HAVE_FDATASYNC]: New macro.
	(C_NOCREAT, C_EXCL, C_FDATASYNC, C_FSYNC): New macros.
	(input_flags, output_flags): New vars.
	(LONGEST_SYMBOL): New macro.
	(struct symbol_value): Renamed from struct conversion.  Members
	symbol and value renamed from convname and conversion.  The
	symbol value is now an array instead of a pointer; this saves
	a bit of space and time in practice.  All uses changed.
	(conversions): Add nocreat, excl, fdatasync, fsync.  Now const.
	(flags): New constant array.
	(iflag_error_msgid, oflag_error_msgid): New constants.
	(parse_symbols): Renamed from parse_conversion and generalized
	to handle either conversion or flag symbols.
	(scanargs): Adjust uses of parse_symbols accodingly.  Add
	support for iflag= and oflag=.  Reject attempts to use
	both excl and nocreat.
	(set_fd_flags): New function.
	(dd_copy): Just return X rather than calling quit (X), since our
	caller invokes quit with the returned value.  Add support for
	fdatasync and fsync.
	(main): Add support for iflag=, oflag=, and new conv= symbols.
	* src/system.h (O_DIRECT, O_DSYNC, O_NDELAY, O_NOFOLLOW,
	O_RSYNC, O_SYNC): Define to 0 if not already defined.

	* NEWS: Remove duplicate mention of BLOCKSIZE.

2004-04-02  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/stty.c: Add support for IUTF8 input flag.

2004-04-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (makedev) [mkdev && !makedev]: Define in terms of mkdev.
	Interix spells it `mkdev'.  Reported by Mark Funkenhauser.

2004-04-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	A specified format is no longer automatically newline terminated.
	If you want a newline at the end of your format, use `\n'.
	* src/stat.c (print_it): Don't print a newline at the end of
	every format.
	(do_statfs): Add a newline at end of each default format string.

2004-03-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/nohup.c (main): Adjust to new calling convention
	for set_cloexec_flag.

2004-03-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Fetish.pm (run_tests): Remove `.orig' file.
	Remove debugging diagnostic.

	Specifying an invalid --width=N (-w) or --gap-size=N (-g)
	would not elicit an error.
	* src/ptx.c: Include "xstrtol.h" and "quotearg.h".
	(main): Don't use atoi.  Use xstrtoul instead.

2004-03-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_prohibit_atoi_atof): New rule.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_atoi_atof: New file.

2004-03-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/files0-from: Use new OUT_SUBST directive, so that this
	test is not sensitive to system-dependent block size differences.
	Prompted by a report of Solaris 8 differences from Paul Eggert.

	* tests/Fetish.pm: Accept new directives: OUT_SUBST, ERR_SUBST.
	Rename `%tmp' to `%actual'.  Reverse order of last two args to
	_compare_files (to $actual, $expected) so as to match declaration.

2004-03-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some gotchas encountered when porting to Solaris 8, using
	the Forte 6u2 compiler.

	* src/hostname.c [HAVE_SETHOSTNAME && !defined sethostname]:
	Declare sethostname, since no Solaris header does it.
	* src/who.c: Include "vasprintf.h", for asprintf.

2004-03-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Minor optimization:
	* src/du.c (process_file): Don't record dev/inode for directories.

	Under some circumstances, without -c, du would mistakenly count the
	space of hard-linked files, not just the first one it encountered.
	Reported by Anthony Thyssen.
	* src/du.c (du_files): Don't ever clear the set of `seen' dev/inodes.

	* src/du.c: Rename global `print_totals' to `print_grand_total'.

	* src/du.c (main): Rearrange filtering loop to be a tiny bit
	more efficient.

	* src/chown-core.c: Don't include savedir.h -- no longer needed.
	* src/chmod.c: Likewise.

2004-03-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (main): Remove now-unused declaration of `i'.

2004-03-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/du.c (main): Filter out file names of length zero before
	invoking fts, so that they don't cause fatal errors.

2004-03-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/files0-from (zero-len): Add a test for the above.

2004-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: New environment var BLOCKSIZE.
	* lib/human.c (humblock): Support BLOCKSIZE as well as BLOCK_SIZE.
	* tests/envvar-check: Test for it.  Factor the code to simplify it.

2004-03-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Shorten the du --files0-from announcement, and say
	"NUL-terminated" rather than "NUL-separated".
	* src/du.c (EXPECTED_BYTES_PER_FILE_NAME, DEFAULT_PROJECTED_N_FILES):
	Remove: not used.
	(usage): Say "NUL-terminated", not "NUL-separated".
	(main): Check for I/O error when istream is closed.
	Allow --files0-from=F even if F is empty; this specifies no files.
	(du_files): Now that we allow the list of files to be empty,
	handle that case.
	* tests/du/files0-from: Adjust to above changes to src/du.c.

2004-03-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/tail-2/assert: Avoid race condition that could cause
	spurious failure.  Based on a patch from Andreas Schwab.

2004-03-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (main): Free the hash table, too.

2004-03-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Remove --info-page= option, reverting
	the change of 2004-01-22.  I can no longer reproduce the problem
	that prompted that change, and `info coreutils pr' would display the
	`printing text' section of the manual, not the one on `pr invocation'.

	* tests/du/files0-from (nul-1, nul-2): Adjust expected diagnostics
	to match corrected output.

	* src/du.c: Include "readtokens0.h" rather than "readtokens.h".
	(main): Use readtoken0 functions rather than readtokens.
	Don't use errno when diagnosing readtokens0 failure.
	Fix off-by-one error in the token number reported in a diagnostic.
	(du_files): Return bool, rather than int.
	(main): Call readtokens0_free.

2004-03-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (ds_free): Plug a small leak.

	* tests/Fetish.pm: Fix typo in comment.

2004-03-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: du accepts a new option --files0-from=FILE, where FILE
	contains a list of NUL-separated file names.

	* src/du.c: Include "readtokens.h".
	(usage): Describe the new option, and adjust the `Usage':
	with this option, no FILE may be specified on the command line.
	(main): Handle the new option.

	* tests/du/files0-from: New tests, for the above.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add files0-from.

	* src/factor.c (do_stdin): Reflect changes in use of readtoken.
	* src/tsort.c (tsort): Likewise.

2004-02-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Add support for a new notation @N to get_date to represent
	the time stamp with numeric value N.  Improve support for
	fractional time stamps.  date's -d and -f options now accept them.
	Likewise for touch -t.  date has a new option --iso-8601=ns.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (touch invocation):
	Describe use of fractional seconds.
	(date invocation, Options for date): Likewise.
	* doc/getdate.texi (General date syntax, Time of day items): Likewise.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (date invocation): Mention effect of LC_TIME.
	(Options for date): Describe new --iso-8601=ns option.

	* doc/getdate.texi: Add copyright notice.  Change getdate to
	get_date when talking about the function name.
	(Seconds since the Epoch): New section, containing the time_t
	info moved from Date input formats section, along with new
	info about the @ syntax.  Mention negative time stamps,
	fractional time stamps, and leap seconds.
	(General date syntax): Modernize examples a bit to reflect new
	features.
	(General date syntax, Relative items in date strings):
	Use ' rather than " to quote formats.
	(Time of day items): Add an example with fractional seconds.
	Describe fractional-second syntax.

	* src/Makefile.am (touch_LDADD): New macro, since `touch' now
	needs clock_gettime.

	* src/date.c (enum Time_spec): New enum TIME_SPEC_NS.
	(time_spec_string, time_spec, show_date): Support it.
	(usage): Remove description of -ITIMESPEC, as it's obsolete and
	confusing.  Mention --iso-8601=ns.
	(batch_convert): getline returns ssize_t, not int.

	* src/touch.c (newtime): Now an array of two timespecs, one
	for access and one for modification.
	(ref_stats): Remove.
	(get_reldate): Use get_date's parameter profile.
	(touch, main): Adjust to above changes.
	(main): Work even if tm_year == INT_MAX (so long as long int is wider).
	Use gettime instead of gettimeofday, for new get_date signature.

	* tests/date/Test.pm (test_vector): New tests epoch, ns-10, ns-max32,
	ns-relative.

2004-03-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (alpha beta major): `Make' the emit_upload_commands
	target before updating $(prev_version_file).

	* tests/misc/date-sec: New file, to test for just-fixed bug in date.
	See today's change in lib/getdate.y.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add date-sec.

2004-03-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Use `.sig' suffix for
	signature files, not `.asc'.  Reported by angico@yahoo.com.

2004-03-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Tweak wording in a diagnostic.
	Suggestion from Karl Berry.
	Include "quoatearg.h".
	(do_copy): Use quotearg_colon (not quote) for diagnostics
	that begin with `"%s:'.

	* src/nl.c (usage): Specify that nl uses _basic_ regular expressions.
	Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2004-03-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.2.1.

	Sometimes, when source and destination partition are different,
	mv mistakenly fails to preserve a hard link.  Reported by IIDA Yosiaki.

	* src/copy.c: When moving a set of N hard-linked files between
	partitions, via two or more command line arguments where the
	command line argument containing the Nth link contains no other
	link to that same file, mv would mistakenly copy the file, rather
	than hard-linking it to the other(s).  That happens because when the
	final link is processed, its link count has been reduced to 1 since
	the other links have been `copied' to the destination partition
	and the source links have been removed.
	(copy_internal): When in move mode, use the source dev/inode
	pair to look up destination name even when st_nlink == 1.
	* src/cp-hash.c (src_to_dest_lookup): New function.
	* src/cp-hash.h (src_to_dest_lookup): Add prototype.
	* tests/mv/part-hardlink: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add part-hardlink.

	* announce-gen: Sync with autoconf.

	* tests/ls/time-1: Exit 77 (not 1) if we can't set up for the test.
	This was triggered on a Linux-2.2.19 system using a file system
	NFS-mounted from some sort of Sun.

2004-03-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.8.3.  Regenerate dependent files.

2004-03-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/deref-args: Also convert sizes in the 70-79 kB range,
	so that this test works with SELinux-enabled systems.
	Based on a patch from Tim Waugh.

	`join -1 x' would give a misleading diagnostic
	* src/join.c (string_to_join_field): Report that a non-numeric field
	number is invalid, rather than `so large that it is not representable'.
	* tests/join/Test.pm (invalid-j): New partial test for the above fix.

2004-03-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	cp --sparse=always sparse-image-file.img /dev/hda1 could
	produce an invalid copy on the destination device.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Even with --sparse=always, try to
	make `holes' only if the destination is a regular file.
	Reported by Szakacsits Szabolcs.

2004-03-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/nohup.c (main): Don't invoke set_cloexec_flag with
	a file descriptor of -1.

2004-03-02  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv@altlinux.org>

	* src/nohup.c: Include "cloexec.h".
	(main): Set the copy of stderr to close on exec.

2004-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* configure.ac: Include <signal.h> when checking for strsignal,
	sys_siglist, and friends.  Problem reported by Tony Leneis in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2004-02/msg00136.html>.

2004-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/deref-args, tests/du/exclude, tests/du/slash:
	* tests/du/trailing-slash: Run envvar-check in case BLOCK_SIZE
	etc. are set.

2004-02-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Document how chown's USER.GROUP argument is now parsed.

2004-02-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/seq.c (usage): Remove stray space after \n in --help output.

2004-02-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (usage): Separate -H and --si.  Say that the meaning
	of -H will soon change to that of --dereference-args (-D).

2004-02-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/comm.c (usage): Tell what comm does when there are no options.
	Reword in terms of FILE1 and FILE2 rather than `left file' and
	`right file'.  Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2004-02-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some POSIX-conformance bugs in expr.

	* NEWS: document the following changes to src/expr.c.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (expr invocation): Likewise.
	Document what forms integers may take, and say "integer"
	consistently instead of "number".  Warn about operands
	that "expr" can misinterpret, and how to work around the
	problem.
	* src/expr.c (eval, eval7, eval6, eval5, eval4, eval3, eval2, eval1):
	Accept a bool argument specifying whether to evaluate the
	expression.  This is to allow short-circuit evaluation.  All
	callers changed.
	(null): Report that a string is zero even if it has
	a form like "-0" or "00".
	(eval1, eval): Use short-circuit evaluation for | and &.
	(eval): Return 0 if both arguments are null or zero, instead
	of returning the first argument.
	* tests/expr/basic: Add some tests for the above.

2004-02-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.2.0.

	`make check' from a build inside a chroot environment would fail
	* tests/help-version: Specify an argument (`/') for df, in the
	unusual event that there is no valid entry in /etc/mtab.
	Likewise for id: add the -u option, so we don't get spurious
	failures when there are no user or group names.
	Patch by Tim Waugh.

	* src/sort.c (usage) [-u]: Add punctuation so that the description in
	the help2man-generated (line-joined) man page is more readable.
	Reported by Tim Waugh.
	[-T]: Add a semicolon, for the same reason.

2004-02-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Qualify target with $(srcdir)/ prefix.

2004-02-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am.in ($(srcdir)/Makefile.am): Use more portable
	$(srcdir)/../Makefile.am.in, rather than $<.
	Suggestion from Michael Elizabeth Chastain.

2004-02-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* config/install-sh: Make this script executable.
	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): New target, to ensure that config/install-sh
	is executable.  Otherwise, on systems that lack a suitable install
	binary, `make install' would fail, because of the way this script
	is invoked (without `$SHELL ' prefix).
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

2004-02-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.1.3.

	* tests/rm/rm5: Avoid triggering a bug in OSF/Tru64's sed
	that would cause an unwarranted test failure.
	* tests/rm/rm3: Likewise.

2004-02-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Remove xstat function pointer member.  The way it was used was not
	portable, since some systems (OSF V5.1, Solaris 2.5.1) provide static
	inline `stat' and `lstat' functions, thus making the tests of
	`xstat == lstat' in copy.c always fail.
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options) [xstat]: Remove member.
	(XSTAT): New macro.
	* src/copy.c (copy_dir): Set `.dereference' member, not .xstat.
	(copy_internal): Use `XSTAT (x, ...)' in place of `*(x->xstat) (...)'.
	Use `x->dereference == DEREF_NEVER' in place of `x->xstat == lstat'.
	(valid_options): Remove now-obsolete FIXME comments.

	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Use `XSTAT (x, ...)' in place of
	`*(x->xstat) (...)'.
	(do_copy): Declare/use local xstat rather than x->xstat.
	(main): Remove code that set x.xstat.
	* src/mv.c (cp_option_init): Don't initialize xstat member.
	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Likewise.

	* Makefile.cfg (gnu_ftp_host-alpha, etc.): Un-factor .gnu.org suffix,
	so that emit_upload_commands can use these variables, too.

2004-02-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/deep-1: Remove `du' stack space test.
	Apparently, `ulimit -s N' isn't portable enough.
	This test will be restored (with a guard against losing ulimit)
	in its own file later.

	* tests/rm/deep-1 (deep): Remove progress-style diagnostics,
	since this test doesn't take long enough to merit them.
	Run du on $tmp (the containing dir), not $deep, the full path to leaf.

	* Makefile.maint (signatures): Remove definition.
	Now, automake's gnupload handles this.
	(%.sig: %): Remove now-unused rule.
	(rel-files): Use automake's $(DIST_ARCHIVES), rather than
	`$(distdir).tar.bz2 $(distdir).tar.gz'.
	(emit-upload-commands): Adjust to use gnupload.

2004-02-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (ST_TIME_CMP_NS, ST_TIME_CMP): Remove definitions.
	(ATIME_CMP, CTIME_CMP, MTIME_CMP, TIMESPEC_NS): Likewise.
	Now, those are all defined in timespec.h.
	Include timespec.h.

	* src/date.c: Don't include timespec.h, now that system.h does it.

2004-02-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't dump core if localtime returns NULL (possible on
	hosts with 64-bit time_t and 32-bit int).
	* src/date.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(batch_convert, main):
	If time conversion fails, exit with nonzero status.
	(show_date): Return int to report conversion failure.
	Print the time as an int if localtime fails.
	* src/uptime.c: Print "??" if the current clock can't
	be converted by localtime.  This won't happen until the year
	2*31 + 1900, but we don't want to dump core even if the current
	clock has the wrong value.

	* src/stat.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(human_time): Print the date/time as a number of seconds since the
	epoch if it can't be converted by localtime.  This is better than
	just saying "invalid", and is consistent with what "ls" does.
	Don't dump core if the year has more than 48 digits; this isn't
	possible on any contemporary host, but we might as well do it right.

2004-01-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/stat.c (human_time): Accept time rather than
	pointer-to-const-time parameter, for clarity.  All callers changed.

2004-02-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (do_stat): Remove extra trailing newline from
	default formats.  Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	Print actual fractional seconds in time stamps, not just `.00000000'.
	* src/stat.c (human_time): Add and use new parameter, t_ns.
	(print_stat): Update callers.
	* src/ls.c (TIMESPEC_NS): Remove definition.
	* src/system.h (TIMESPEC_NS): Define here, instead, now that stat.c
	also uses this macro.
	Nelson H. F. Beebe noticed that ls --full-time printed nonzero
	fractional seconds for files on an XFS file system, but that stat's
	fractional seconds were always zero.

2004-01-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Use 'double' for loop index, not
	'int', to avoid problems with integer overflow.  On almost all
	machines 'double' works in every case where 'int' works, and
	it works on other cases besides.

2004-01-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/seq.c (usage): Mention that if INCREMENT is omitted,
	it defaults to 1, even when FIRST is larger than LAST.
	Reword so as not to exclude the possibility that INCREMENT be zero.

2004-01-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.1.2.

	* Makefile.maint (signatures): Comment out definition.

2004-01-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (header_regexp): Add exitfail.

	* man/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add help2man.
	Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Prefix help2man invocation with `$(PERL) --'
	so it works on systems with Perl installed somewhere other than in
	/usr/bin.

	* src/paste.c (paste_parallel): Declare local, chr, to be of type
	`int', not `char', since it must hold EOF.  This bug would make
	paste infloop on some systems.  Test failures reported by
	Nelson H. F. Beebe and Christian Krackowizer.

2004-01-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rmdir/fail-perm: New file.  Test for just-fixed rmdir bug.
	* tests/rmdir/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fail-perm.

	* man/help2man: Fix it so using --info-page='coreutils PROG' works.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Invoke our own (tweaked) copy of help2man.
	Use --info-page='coreutils PROG' option.
	Now, readlink.1 refers the user to `info coreutils readlink'
	rather than to `info readlink'.  Reported by Matt Swift.

2004-01-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Exit status cleanup.

	* src/basename.c (usage): Use EXIT_SUCCESS, not 0, for clarity.

	Although it's no longer necessary, set TZ=UTC0 also for the
	initial touch command.  Reported by Paul Jarc here:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/1504

2004-01-20  Diego Biurrun  <diego@biurrun.de>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add .mov to the list of media files.

2004-01-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/touch/relative: Use TZ=UTC0, not TZ=utc (which isn't
	portable).  Problem reported by Christian Krackowizer.  Also, use
	+0000 rather than +0 to specify a time zone, as the documentation

2004-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	From Andreas Schwab.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove `/vg' (prerelease test
	remnant) from PATH component.  That would cause tests in this directory
	not to run the just-built binaries, but rather whatever happened
	to be in one's PATH.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2004-01-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/csplit.c (new_control_record): Use x2nrealloc

	* src/chroot.c: Include "quote.h".
	(CHROOT_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE, CHROOT_FAILURE): Define.
	(main): Exit with status of 127, not 1, for too-few-args,

	* tests/join/Test.pm (tv): Avoid obsolete -o usage.

2003-12-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/join.c (add_field_list): Don't use alloca with unbounded

	Various other minor cleanups, mostly to avoid the need for casts.

	(extract_field): Renamed from ADD_FIELD, as it's now a function.

	(struct field.beg): Now char *, not unsigned char const *.  All

	(empty_filler): Now const *.

	(make_blank): Remove; wasn't needed.  Remove all calls.

2003-11-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix 'cut' problems with size_t overflow and unsigned int.
	More generally, resize integer variables to fit use more precisely.
	* src/cut.c (ADD_RANGE_PAIR): Remove unnecessary parens.
	(struct range_pair): Make members to be of type size_t, not unsigned.
	(max_range_endpoint, eol_range_start): Now size_t, not unsigned.
	(suppress_non_delimited, output_delimiter_specified,
	have_read_stdin, print_kth, set_fields): Now bool, nt int.
	(delim): Now unsigned char, not int.
	(mark_printable_field, is_printable_field, is_range_start_index,
	set_fields, set_fields, cut_bytes, cut_fields):
	Use size_t, not unsigned, for field and byte counts.
	(hash_int): Use uintptr_t, not unsigned, for pointers converted
	to integers.  This squeezes more info out of them.
	(set_fields, cut_bytes, cut_fields, main):
	Use bool, not int, for booleans.
	(set_fields): Allocate zeroed byte array with xzalloc, not xcalloc.

2003-11-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* man/Makefile.am (check-programs-vs-x):
	Work even if $(programs) contains '$'.

	Similarly, cast NULL to `(char *)' in call to variadic function,
	parse_long_options, so that it works even on systems for which
	sizeof char* != sizeof int.
	A similar problem was reported by Harti Brandt in
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2003-10/msg00320.html.

	* src/users.c (users): Free `utmp_buf' explicitly so that people

	Don't fail when run with VERBOSE=yes.
	* tests/chgrp/basic: Do `set +x' before starting the subshell
	from which we invoke chgrp.  Otherwise, the output from the
	VERBOSE=yes-induced `set -x' would result in spurious differences.
	Reported by Russel Coker via Michael Stone.

2003-10-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	chmod now uses fts to perform a directory traversal when -R is
	specified.  Before, it operated on full path names, and as such
	would encounter the PATH_MAX (often 4096) limit.

	* src/chmod.c: Include "xfts.h".
	(process_file): Rename from change_file_mode.
	Adapt to be used with fts.
	(process_files): New function.

2003-10-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	gcc's warning about shadowing a global.

2003-10-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	chown and chgrp now accept POSIX-mandated -H, -L, -P options and
	use fts to perform a directory traversal when -R is specified.
	Before, they operated on full path names, and as such would
	encounter the PATH_MAX (often 4096) limit.
	They are more efficient.  For example, before, chgrp -R would
	take almost 5 seconds to change about 2000 directories and fail
	(with `File name too long'), while now it succeeds on a hierarchy
	of depth 20,000 in 1/10 the time.

	* src/chown.c: Include "userspec.h" and "fts_.h".
	(WRITTEN_BY): Add my name.
	(getpwnam, getgrnam, getgrgid): Remove declarations.
	(endpwent): Remove definition.

	* src/chgrp.c: Include "fts_.h".
	(WRITTEN_BY): Add my name.
	(MAXUID, MAXGID): Remove definitions.  Use GID_T_MAX instead of
	the latter.
	(usage): Update.
	(main): Handle new options.
	Call new function, chown_files rather than change_file_owner.

	Rewrite to iterate through hierarchies using fts rather than
	via explicit recursion.
	* src/chown-core.c: Include "fts_.h"
	(change_file_owner): Rewrite to use FTS* and FTSENT* and to operate
	on a single file at a time.
	(chown_files): New function.
	* src/chown-core.h [enum Dereference_symlink]: Remove declaration.
	[struct Chown_option] (recurse, force_silent): Change type to `bool'.

	(chown_files): New prototype.

	* tests/chgrp/recurse: Update tests accordingly.

	* tests/chgrp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add posix-H.

	* src/ln.c (usage): Clarify that --directory, -d, -F probably won't
	work even for superuser.  Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2003-10-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some number-parsing bugs, e.g., "head -n 100k@" wasn't
	properly diagnosed.
	* lib/human.c, lib/xstrtoimax.c, lib/xstrtol.c, lib/xstrtol.h,
	lib/xstrtoul.c, lib/xstrtoumax.c: Sync with gnulib.
	* src/sort.c (parse_field_count): Handle the case where overflow
	and invalid suffix char are both reported.

2003-10-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches) [TIOCGWINSZ]: Comment out the
	warning-inducing test, ws.ws_col <= SIZE_MAX, since it was always
	true on Linux.

2003-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix to avoid a denial-of-service attack if the display width is
	enormous.  Also, clean up the code a bit by removing duplicate code.

	* src/ls.c (init_column_info): Remove forward decl; no longer needed.
	(calculate_columns): New function, that contains code that used
	to be common to print_many_per_line and print_horizontal.
	(print_many_per_line, print_horizontal): Use it.
	(decode_switches): Set max_idx here, not in calculate_columns.
	(print_current_files): Don't call init_column_info; calculate_columns
	now does that.
	(init_column_info): Don't allocate a lot more space than is needed
	to represent the current set of files.  Allocate all the new
	size_t cells in one call to xnmalloc, rather than a row at a time.

2003-10-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (init_column_info): Add another FIXME comment.

2003-10-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix address-arithmetic bug in 'ls', reported by Georgi Guninski.
	Remove several arbitrary limits on hosts where int cannot represent
	all size_t values.

	* src/ls.c (struct bin_str.len, length_of_file_name_and_frills, indent,
	nfiles, files_index, tabsize, line_length, struct column_info.line_len,
	struct column_info.col_arr[0], max_idx):
	Now size_t, not int.
	(get_funky_string): Return bool indicating success, instead of
	a negative count to indicate failure.  Store number of columns
	through new parameter OUTPUT_COUNT; that way, they can never
	go negative.  Change equals_end from int to bool.  All uses
	changed.
	(struct column_info.valid_len): Now bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(dired_dump_obstack, get_funky_string, clear_files,
	extract_dirs_from_files, print_current_files,
	print_many_per_line, print_horizontal, init_column_info,
	put_indicator, length_of_file_name_and_frills,
	print_with_commas): Use size_t, not int, for local variables
	that count sizes.
	(decode_switches): Decode sizes using xstrtoul, not xstrtol.
	Check for TIOCGWINSZ returing negative values (or values greater
	than SIZE_MAX!).
	(visit_dir, main, parse_ls_color, queue_directory, add_ignore_pattern,
	init_column_info):
	Use xmalloc and xnmalloc, not XMALLOC.
	(gobble_file): Use xnrealloc, not XREALLOC.
	(print_color_indicator): Remove now-unnecessary cast to size_t.

2003-10-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/no-x: Change wording of diagnostic to match latest du.c.
	* tests/sort/sort-tests: Remove from CVS; assume that people
	brave enough to check coreutils out from CVS can rebuild it.

2003-10-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	New options: --preserve-root and --no-preserve-root.
	* src/chmod.c (change_file_mode): Honor new option.
	(change_file_mode): Strip trailing slashes on directory
	argument passed to change_dir_mode.
	(get_root_dev_ino): New function.
	(main): Initialize global, root_dev_ino.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't #ifdef-out simple uses of
	S_ISLNK or S_ISSOCK.  The S_IS* macros are guaranteed to be defined
	via system.h.
	* src/chmod.c (change_file_mode): Likewise.

2003-10-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/csplit.c (main): Remove obsolete FIXME.

2003-10-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.8.  Regenerate dependent files.

2003-09-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	csplit cleanup.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (csplit invocation):
	The regexp offset need not have a sign; POSIX requires support
	for signless offets.

	Be more careful about int widths.  For example, remove some
	arbitrary limits by replacing 'unsigned' with 'size_t',
	'uintmax_t', etc.  Use standard bool rather than a homegrown type.
	* lib/Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add xstrtoimax.c.
	* src/csplit.c (FALSE, TRUE, boolean): Remove.  All uses changed
	to <stdbool.h> usage.
	(struct control): offset is now intmax_t, not int.
	repeat_forever is now bool, not int.
	(struct cstring): len is now size_t, not unsigned int.
	(struct buffer_record): bytes_alloc, bytes_used, num_lines are now
	size_t, not unsigned.  start_line, first_available are now
	uintmax_t, not unsigned.
	(hold_count, control_used): Now size_t, not unsigned.
	(last_line_number, current_line, bytes_written):
	Now uintmax_t, not unsigned.
	(save_to_hold_area, red_input, keep_new_line, record_line_starts,
	create_new_buffer, get_new_buffer, load_buffer, find_line,
	process_regexp, split_file, new_control_record, extract_regexp,
	get_format_width, get_format_prec, max_out):
	size args, locals, and returned values are now size_t, not unsigned
	or int.
	(get_first_line_in_buffer, find_line, write_to_file,
	handle_line_error, process_line_count, regexp_error, process_regexp,
	split_file):
	File line, byte, and repetition counts are now uintmax_t, not unsigned.
	(check_for_offset): Don't require a sign before the offset.
	Use xstrtoimax to do the real work.
	(extract_regexp): Remove harmful cast of size to unsigned.
	256 -> 1<<CHAR_BIT, for clarity.
	(get_format_flags): Return at most 3, to avoid worries about overflow.

	(bytes_to_octal_digits): Remove.

	(cleanup): Don't check whether output_stream is NULL, since
	close_output_file does that for us.

	(new_line_control, create_new_buffer): Use "foo *p = xmalloc
	(sizeof *p);" instead of the more long-winded alternatives.

	(get_new_buffer): Use O(1) algorithm for resizing a buffer
	to a much larger size, instead of an O(N) algorithm.

	(process_regexp): Use plain NULL rather than casted 0.

	(make_filename): Use %u, not %d, to format unsigned file number.

	(new_control_record): Use xrealloc exclusively, since it handles
	NULL reliably.

	(extract_regexp): Change misspelled word in diagnostic.

	(get_format_width): Even if a minimum field width is specified,
	allow room for enough octal digits to represent the value of
	the maximum representible integer.  This fixes a potential
	buffer overrun.  Calculate this room at compile-time, not
	at run-time; this removes the need for bytes_to_octal_digits.
	Check for overflow; this removes a FIXME.

	(get_format_prec): Don't allow precision to be signed; it's
	not ANSI.  Check for overflow.  Remove hardcoded "11" as
	default precision; this fixes a potential buffer overrun
	on hosts with wider size_t.

	(get_format_conv_type): Change local variable to be of type
	unsigned char, not int; this removes a potential subscript
	violation on hosts where char is signed.

	(max_out): Replace "for (;*p;)" with more-standard "while (*p)".
	Allow "%%" in format.  Don't overflow when
	counting lots of percents.

	(usage): Default sprintf format is %02u, not %d.

	Don't exhaust virtual memory when processing large inputs.
	Fix this by removing csplit's internal free-list management;
	instead rely on malloc for that.

	* src/csplit.c (free_list): Remove global.
	(clear_all_line_control): Remove function.
	(get_new_buffer): Always use create_new_buffer to obtain a
	new buffer, rather than searching free_list.
	(free_buffer): Just call free.
	Reported by Nikola Milutinovic.

2003-09-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	after ferror discovers an output error.  We don't know the proper
	errno value, since it might have been caused by any of a whole
	bunch of calls, and it might have been trashed in the meantime.
	Fixing this problem will require much more extensive changes;
	in the meantime just say "write error".
	* src/od.c (check_and_close, dump, dump_strings): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Likewise.

	* src/join.c (get_line): Report error right away if I/O fails,
	so that the proper errno value is used.
	* src/tac.c (tac_seekable, tac_file, save_stdin): Likewise.
	* src/tee.c (tee): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Likewise.

	* src/od.c (skip): If a read fails, don't retry it later, so
	that we report the proper errno.

	* src/tac.c (tac_mem): Don't return a value; nobody uses it.

	* src/tee.c (tee): Once a write failure has occurred, don't bother
	writing anything more to that stream.

	* src/uniq.c (check_file): Check for ferror (stdout) even if
	ostream == stdout.

	* src/yes.c (UNROLL): Remove.
	(main): Exit immediately when write failure is detected.
	Simplify code by assigning to argv when argc == 1.

2003-09-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ptx.c: Switch encoding from Latin-1 to UTF-8.
	(WRITTEN_BY): Change "Franc,ois" (actually using
	c-with-cedilla in Latin-1) to "F.", so that it's ASCII, as
	xgettext requires.

2003-09-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`du -D symlink-to-dir' would mistakenly omit the slash in
	lines like this: 24	symlink-to-dir/subdir
	* src/du.c (process_file): Fix offset calculation.
	Reported by Jeff Sheinberg as Debian bug #211591;
	http://bugs.debian.org/205251

	* tests/du/deref-args: New file/test for the above.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add deref-args.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Remove useless disjunct.

	* src/sys2.h (case_GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Rename parameter, Authors,
	to Written_by.
	* nearly all src/*.c files (WRITTEN_BY): Rename from AUTHORS.
	Begin each WRITTEN_BY string with `Written by ' and end it with `.'.
	Mark each WRITTEN_BY string as translatable.

	* basename.c, cat.c, chroot.c, cksum.c, comm.c, cp.c, csplit.c, cut.c:
	* dd.c, df.c, dirname.c, du.c, echo.c, env.c, expr.c, factor.c, head.c:

	* touch.c, tsort.c, uniq.c, unlink.c, uptime.c, users.c, wc.c:
	* who.c, whoami.c, yes.c: Revert yesterday's changes.
	Instead, a subsequent change will embed `Written by ' in
	each string along with the author names.

	* src/true.c: Revert yesterday's changes.
	* src/sys2.h: Likewise.

2003-09-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* who.c, whoami.c, yes.c: Update AUTHORS definition to be a
	comma-separated list of strings and/or update the call to
	parse_long_options so that `AUTHORS, NULL' are the last parameters.
	* src/true.c (main): Append NULL to version_etc argument list.
	* src/sys2.h (case_GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Likewise.

	* src/sort.c (numcompare): Rename local, logb, to log_b to avoid
	shadowing the math function name.  Also rename loga to log_a.

2003-09-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/factor.c (print_factors): Give a separate diagnostic
	for numbers that are too large, but otherwise valid.
	Reported by Dániel Varga.

2003-09-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.7.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Use ../src/tr -s ' ' '\n' in place
	of `fmt -1'.  Using the just-built tr is a little cleaner.
	Christian Krackowizer reported that HPUX 10.20 doesn't have fmt.
	* man/Makefile.am (programs, check-x-vs-1): Likewise.

2003-09-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c: Alphabetize includes.
	Remove duplicate inclusion of "same.h".

2003-09-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP_ENV): Remove --rsyncable.
	Didn't give enough of a benefit, mainly because it's not yet
	in wide enough use.

	* Version 5.0.91.

	* man/Makefile.am (programs): Use ../src, not $(srcdir)/../src.
	(check-programs-vs-x): Fail if $(programs) is empty.

	* src/remove.c: Add a comment.

2003-09-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (D_INO, ENABLE_CYCLE_CHECK) [D_INO_IN_DIRENT]:
	Don't define.  These symbols are no longer used.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Write ^D as \cD.
	Complete the change of 2003-08-02.

	* Makefile.maint (po-check): Use cvsu, so that a temporary source
	file in lib/ or src/ doesn't induce an unwarranted failure.
	Add a kludge to filter out the sole generated source file that
	also has translatable messages: src/false.c.

2003-09-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/tail.c (enum): Add ALLOW_MISSING_OPTION.
	(parse_options): Give a diagnostic for (but still accept) the
	deprecated --allow-missing option.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't ignore -S if input is a pipe.  Bug report by Michael McFarland in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-09/msg00008.html>.

	* src/sort.c (sort_buffer_size): Omit SIZE_BOUND arg.  Compute the
	size_bound ourselves. if an input file is a pipe and the user
	specified a size, use that size instead of trying to guess the
	pipe size.  This has the beneficial side effect of avoiding the
	overhead of default_sort_size in that case.  All callers changed.
	(sort): Remove static var size; now done by sort_buffer_size.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.6b and autoconf-2.57b.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/tail-2/tail-n0f: Wait .5 seconds for backgrounded process
	to start, rather than just .1.  Upon failure, print unexpected state.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Don't assign 0 or
	SAFE_READ_ERROR to tmp->nbytes.
	* src/tail.c (pipe_lines, pipe_bytes): Likewise.

	* src/head.c (struct linebuffer): Change nbytes and nlines
	from unsigned int to size_t.  unsigned int is safe (after the
	2003-09-03 patch) but size_t is cleaner.
	* src/tail.c (struct linebuffer, struct charbuffer): Likewise.
	(pipe_bytes): Likewise for local variable 'i', which was 'int'.

	Standardize on BUFSIZ as opposed to other macro names and values.
	* src/head.c (BUFSIZE): Remove.  All uses changed to BUFSIZ.
	* src/tail.c (BUFSIZ) [!defined BUFSIZ]: Remove.
	stdio.h has always defined it,
	and other code already assumes it's defined.
	* src/tr.c (BUFSIZ) [!defined BUFSIZ]: Likewise.
	(IO_BUF_SIZE): Remove; replace all uses with sizeof io_buf.
	(io_buf): IO_BUF_SIZE -> BUFSIZ.

2003-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/seq.c (step): Default to 1.
	(print_numbers): Allow the output to be empty.
	(main): The default step is 1, even if LAST < FIRST;
	as per documentation.
	* tests/seq/basic (onearg-2): Output should be empty.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.cfg (wget_files): Temporarily disable, until master
	versions are restored to ftp.gnu.org.

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Specify automake-1.7.6.

	Make seq's --width (-w) option work properly even when the
	endpoint requiring the larger width is negative and smaller than
	the other endpoint.
	* src/seq.c (get_width_format): Include `-' in the set of bytes
	allowed in a `simple' number (no decimal point, no exponent).
	Reported by Patrick Mauritz.

2003-09-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: sort -t '\0' now uses a NUL tab.
	sort option order no longer matters, unless POSIX requires it.
	* src/sort.c (usage): Say "blanks" instead of "whitespace",
	Similar fixes for many comments.
	(TAB_DEFAULT): New constant, so that we can support NUL as
	the field separator.
	(tab): Now int, not char.  Initialize to TAB_DEFAULT.
	(specify_sort_size): If multiple sizes are specified, use the largest.
	(begfield, limfield): Support NUL tab char.
	(set_ordering): Do not let -i override -d.
	(main): Report an error if incompatible -o or -t options are given.
	Report an error for "-t ''".  Allow "-t '\0'" to specify a NUL tab.

2003-09-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/sort/Test.pm [o2, nul-tab]: New tests for the above.

2003-09-03  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	Bug report and patch here:
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-09/msg00009.html>
	* src/tail.c (pipe_lines): Don't truncate return value from safe_read.
	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Likewise.

2003-09-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (AUTHORS): Remove Larry McVoy's name, since the relatively
	small amount of code from him was first moved to lib/human.c, and was
	subsequently rewritten entirely.
	* src/df.c (AUTHORS): Likewise.

2003-08-22  Lawrence Teo  <lcteo@uncc.edu>

	* src/md5sum.c (split_3): Accept the BSD format for generic
	message digest modes.  Currently works with BSD's MD5 and SHA1
	formats since these are the two algorithms presently used in
	coreutils.  Updated comments to reflect this change.
	(bsd_split_3): Updated comments.

	* tests/md5sum/basic-1: New test to make sure that
	`md5sum --check' doesn't accept the BSD SHA1 format (adapted
	from `check-bsd' test in tests/sha1sum/basic-1).

	* tests/sha1sum/basic-1 (check-bsd2, check-bsd3): New tests for
	--check exit status and BSD SHA1 format (adapted from tests
	in tests/md5sum/basic-1).

2003-08-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Use SAME_INODE rather than open-coding it.

	When source and destination arguments refer to the same file, reside
	on a partition (e.g. VFAT) on which distinct names may refer to the
	same directory entry (often due to variations in case), and when the
	link count for the file is 1, mv no longer unlinks the file.  Instead,
	it gives the expected diagnostic that the source and destination are
	the same.  WARNING: this is an incomplete fix.  If the file happens
	to have a link count of 2 or greater, such an erroneous mv command
	will still unlink it.
	Although that is not possible on vfat or umsdos, it is possible on
	other file system types, e.g., ntfs, and hpfs.
	* src/copy.c (same_file_ok): Invoke same_name (which might still
	return false for names that refer to the same directory entry)
	only if the link count is 2 or more.
	* tests/mv/vfat: Show how to demonstrate the above problem.
	This test is not run.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add vfat.

2003-08-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c: Change meaning of -l from --lookup to --login, per POSIX.
	who's -l option has been eliciting an unconditional warning about
	this impending change since sh-utils-2.0.12 (April 2002).

	* src/paste.c (paste_parallel): Don't output `EOF' (aka -1) as a `char'.
	This would happen for nonempty files not ending with a newline.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.
	* tests/misc/paste-no-nl: New file.  Test for above-fixed bug.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add paste-no-nl.

	* src/stat.c (print_it): Avoid buffer overrun that would
	occur when the user-specified format string ends with `%'.
	Patch by Tommi Kyntola.
	* tests/misc/stat-fmt: New file.  Test for above-fixed bug.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add stat-fmt.

2003-08-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Apply changes from bison.
	* GNUmakefile (SHELL): Define to `sh', if necessary.
	Add copyright.
	* Makefile.maint (WGETFLAGS): Define to `-C off'.
	Update all uses of $(WGET).

2003-08-22  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* Makefile.cfg (local-checks-to-skip): New.
	* Makefile.maint (local-check): Rename as...
	(local-checks-available): this.
	(local-check): New.

2003-08-26  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Neutralize "<#" as
	"<\#" to avoid magic from Gnus when posting parts of this script.

2003-08-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (main): Warn about use of deprecated `-l' option.

2003-08-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c (do_stat): For link count at end of line, use %h format,
	instead of %-5h.  The latter would make stat emit trailing spaces.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.

2003-08-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_space_tab .x-sc_sun_os_names

2003-08-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Include stdlib.h unconditionally,
	as we're now assuming that part of hosted C89.

2003-08-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (textdomain, bindtextdomain) [! ENABLE_NLS]: Define away,
	to avoid warnings from gcc.

2003-08-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid unnecessary and sometimes time-consuming hostname lookups.
	* src/who.c (print_user): Use strchr, not strrchr.
	* src/pinky.c (print_entry): Likewise.
	Patch by Michael Stone.
	This fixes a typo I introduced in who-users.c on 1996-02-23.

	* Makefile.maint (makefile-check): Add 0-9 to the range of characters
	disallowed between `@...@'.

2003-08-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* configure.ac (fu_cv_sys_truncating_statfs): Remove; now
	done by gnulib .m4 files.
	(jm_DUMMY_1): Require gl_READUTMP, not jm_PREREQ_READUTMP.
	* src/sys2.h (strtoull): Remove unused declaration.

2003-08-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Ensure that generated PROGRAM.1 files
	are read-only.

	* src/tail.c (tail_lines): Fix a potential (but very hard to exercise)
	race condition bug.  The bug would be triggered when tailing a file
	with file pointer not at beginning of file, and where the file was
	truncated to have a length of less than the initial offset at just
	the right moment (between the two lseek calls in this function).

	An invalid initial value for *read_pos would result in
	`tail -n0 -f FILE' and `tail -c0 -f FILE' doing what amounted to a
	busy-wait rather than sleeping between iterations.  The bug manifests
	itself only when tailing regular files that are initially nonempty.
	* src/tail.c (tail_bytes): Set *read_pos to new file offset after
	each xlseek call.
	(tail_lines): Likewise, after lseek calls.
	Reported by Nick Estes.  See http://bugs.debian.org/205251 for details.
	* tests/tail-2/tail-n0f: New file.  Test for above fix.
	* tests/tail-2/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add tail-n0f.

2003-08-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_space_tab): Use exclusion list in separate file.
	(sc_sun_os_names): Likewise.
	* .x-sc_space_tab, .x-sc_sun_os_names: New files.

	* man/help2man: Remove some SPACEs before TAB.

2003-08-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* Makefile.maint (LC_ALL): Set to C.
	* man/Makefile.am (ASSORT): New var.
	(check-x-vs-1, programs): Use it.
	* src/Makefile.am (ASSORT, check-README, ../AUTHORS): Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am (ASSORT, all_programs): Likewise.

2003-08-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	fold -s -wN would infloop for N < 8 with TABs in the input.
	E.g., this would not terminate: printf 'a\tb' | fold -w2 -s
	* src/fold.c (fold_file): Move contents of `else'-block
	out of conditional so it's used also for --spaces (-s).
	* tests/misc/fold: Test for the above fix.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fold.

2003-08-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nice.c [!NICE_PRIORITY]: Include <sys/resource.h> after
	system.h so the types from time.h and sys/time.h are available.
	It appears that this is necessary for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and
	Darwin 6.5 (MacOS 10.2.5).  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2003-08-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Add support for setting file timestamps to microsecond
	resolution, on hosts that support this.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp.c, src/install.c, src/touch.c: Include utimens.h.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal):
	Set file timestamps with utimens, not utime.
	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (change_timestamps): Likewise.
	* src/touch.c (newtime, touch, main): Likewise.

2003-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_sun_os_names): New rule based on a regexp
	from Paul Eggert.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it.

	* src/tail.c (main): Tweak Solaris OS version number in comment.
	* src/wc.c (wc): Likewise
	* tests/tail-2/fflush: Likewise.

	* src/tail.c: Add new undocumented option, --presume-input-pipe.
	(pipe_lines): Use memchr to skip lines, rather than an explicit loop.

2003-08-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Use new gnulib 'extensions' module.
	* configure.ac: Invoke gl_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS instead of
	AC_GNU_SOURCE.

2003-08-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/du/basic: Ensure that a/b/F has at least 65 bytes too.

2003-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Reflect that `split -a 0' is now accepted.
	For tests of obsolete behavior, don't presume that unsetting
	_POSIX2_VERSION is equivalent to _POSIX2_VERSION=199209.

2003-08-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/coreutils.texi (split invocation):
	Add -d or --numeric-suffixes option to 'split'.
	From a suggestion by Jesse Kornblum.
	* src/split.c (suffix_alphabet): New var.
	(longopts, usage, next_file_name, main): Support -d.
	(next_file_name, main): Allow -a0, as POSIX requires.
	(next_file_name): Don't assume ASCII-like encoding;
	'a' through 'z' are not contiguous in EBCDIC.

2003-08-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Merge getline from gnulib.
	* lib/getline.h, lib/getline.c, m4/getline.m4: Merge from gnulib.
	* lib/getndelim2.h, lib/getndelim2.c, m4/getndelim2.m4, m4/ssize_t.m4:
	New files, from gnulib.
	* lib/getdelim2.c, lib/getdelim2.h: Remove.
	* lib/Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Change getdelim2.c and
	getdelim2.h to getndelim2.c and getndelim2.h.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (jm_MACROS): Use gl_GETNDELIM2 rather than
	checking for getdelim.
	(jm_CHECK_ALL_TYPES): Use gt_TYPE_SSIZE_T for ssize_t rather
	than rolling our own.
	* src/cut.c: Include getndelim2.h rather than getdelim2.h.
	(cut_fields): Invoke getndelim2 rather than getdelim2.

2003-08-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (main): Use unsigned int instead of int for `nsigs'
	and for the indices to iterate through nsigs.

2003-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c: Minor code cleanups, mostly to use more accurate
	types and to remove unnecessary casts.
	(min, max): Remove.  All uses changed to MIN and MAX.
	(hard_lc_collate, hard_LC_TIME, struct buffer.eof, struct
	keyfield.skipsblanks, struct keyfield.skipeblanks, struct
	keyfield.numeric, struct keyfield.general_numeric, struct
	keyfield.month, struct keyfield.reverse, reverse, unique,
	have_read_stdin): Now bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(eolchar): Now char, not int.
	(struct keyfield.ignore): Now bool const *, not int *.
	(struct keyfield.translate): Now char const *, not char *.
	(struct month.name): Likewise.
	(blanks, nonprinting, nondictionary): Now bool[], not int[].
	(cleanup, inittables, keycompare, check, mergefps, first_same_file,
	check, sort, main): Use const * pointers when possible.
	(month_cmp): Rewrite to avoid casts.
	(inittables): Initialize tables unconditionally, to avoid branches.
	(fillbuf): Return bool, not int.  All uses changed.
	(fillbuf, keycompare, new_key, main):
	Use SIZE_MAX rather than (size_t) -1.
	(trailing_blanks): Renamed from trim_trailing_blanks.
	Return the number of blanks to trim.  All uses changed.
	(getmonth): Use trailing_blanks rather than open code.
	(keycompare): Do not cast char * to unsigned char *; not needed.
	CMP_WITH_IGNORE converts args to UCHAR, so no need to convert it
	ourselves.
	(compare, main): Use | rather than || to avoid jumps.
	Replace "diff = NONZERO (alen)" with "diff = 1", since alen must
	be nonzero there.
	(check, first_same_file, sort, main):
	Use bool instead of int local vars when possible.
	(check): Merge the old 'checkfp' and 'check' into a single function,
	that returns a boolean (true if the file was ordered).
	All uses changed.
	(main): Use int instead of unsigned for iterating through nsigs.
	Rename local var "posix_pedantic" to "posixly_correct".

2003-08-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nice.c [!NICE_PRIORITY]: Include <time.h> before <sys/resource.h>
	to avoid compilation error on Ultrix. Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Don't read again after encountering an
	initial EOF.  E.g., `cut -f2' would do so.
	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Add a test for the above fix.

	* src/sort.c (sortlines): Add description and references.
	From Paul Eggert.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set PATH so that
	the tests in help-version will use the just-built binaries.
	Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2003-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS: Add --rfc-2822 option to GNU date.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Time directives, Options for date, Examples
	of date): Likewise.
	* src/date.c (long_options, usage, main): Likewise.
	* doc/getdate.texi (General date syntax): Likewise.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Options for date): Fix a typo in format:
	it's now %d not %_d.  Add URLs.

2003-08-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/shred/remove: Ensure that $? is 0 for the final `exit 0'.
	Otherwise, with at least the /bin/sh from HPUX 10.20,
	the trap code would end up converting that to exit 1 and thus an
	unexpected test failure.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

2003-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ptx.c: Do not include bumpalloc.h.
	(WORD_TABLE): New member alloc.
	(ALLOC_NEW_WORD): Remove.
	(occurs_alloc): New var.
	(digest_word_file, find_occurs_in_text): Check for arithmetic
	overflow when computing table size.  Use xrealloc rather than
	bumpalloc primitives.

2003-07-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.90.

	* README: When running tests as root, suggest using
	sudo with NON_ROOT_USERNAME=$USER.

	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Makefile is in ../src, not
	$(srcdir)/../src.

2003-07-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP_ENV): Try Debian/gzip's new --rsyncable option.

2003-07-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/stdbool.hin (_Bool): Make it signed char, instead of
	an enum type, so that it's guaranteed to promote to int.
	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Undo previous change.

2003-07-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sort.c (sortlines_temp): Declare local `swap' to be `int', not
	`bool'.  Otherwise, at least one buggy compiler (alpha gcc-2.95.4)
	would cause lines[-1 - swap] (with swap = false) to evaluate to
	lines[4294967295].

2003-07-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/priv-check (my_uid): Use `!', not `^' in case pattern `[!0-9]',
	since /bin/sh of at least NetBSD 1.6 and OpenBSD 3.2 don't accept `^'.

	* src/remove.c (prompt) [! recursive]: Don't prompt about unwritable
	directories, as required by POSIX.   Reported by Karl Berry.
	* tests/rm/dir-no-w: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dir-no-w.

	* tests/mk-script: Emit `$xx', not its expansion.

2003-07-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	This change was inspired by a similar proposal by Stepan Kasal.
	* src/sort.c (mergelines, sortlines_temp): New functions.
	(sortlines): Use them, to reduce the number of times that
	we need to copy 'struct line' values.  This improved CPU
	performance by about 30% on one 18 MB test.
	(sort): Don't invoke sortlines unless we have 2 or more lines.

2003-07-26  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* src/sort.c (sort): Don't require two `struct line's per text line,
	the new sort algorithm requires just 1.5.

2003-07-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Use %lu, not %ld.
	From Paul Eggert.
	* src/cut.c (is_printable_field): Simplify bit arithmetic.
	From Paul Eggert.
	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Put `volatile' in the right place.
	From Paul Eggert.

2003-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Use only one bit per field/offset in array, not one `int'.
	* src/cut.c (printable_field): Change type to `unsigned char'.
	(mark_printable_field, is_printable_field): New functions.
	Use them in place of all direct accesses of `printable_field'.

	* src/expand.c (parse_tabstops): Detect overflow properly.
	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Likewise.

	* src/rm.c: Include "dirname.h".
	(usage): Use base_name (program_name) in body of --help output.
	This lets me...
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): ...back out the kludge of 2003-07-22.
	Idea from Brendan O'Dea, who suggested using
	`program_name = basename (argv[0]);' everywhere --
	can't do that, but using base_name works just fine here.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT): Exempt test.

2003-07-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some POSIX-compliance problems with 'test'.  This makes
	'test' more compatible with Bash.

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: Document the following.
	* src/test.c: Include exitfail.h.
	(TEST_FAILURE): New constant, used for exit status if 'test' fails.
	(test-syntax_error): Use it.
	(binary_operator): Now takes bool arg specifying whether left operand
	is -l ARG, so that caller determines this rather than us.
	All uses changed.
	(term): Use posixtest to evaluate parenthesized subexpressions.
	(unary_operator, one_argument): Remove support for -t without operand.
	(one_argument): Take argument from argv[pos].
	(one_argument, two_arguments, three_arguments): Advance pos.
	All callers changed.
	(three_arguments): Look for binary ops before "!".  Then look
	for parenthesized one_argument expressions, instead of trusting
	expr () to do the right thing.
	(posixtest): Now takes number of args.  All callers changed.
	Treat "( A B )" like "A B".
	(main): Set exit_failure to TEST_FAILURE.  Don't depend on
	POSIXLY_CORRECT, as we now conform to POSIX by default.
	(main) [!LBRACKET]: Do not recognize "--help" or "--verbose" unless.
	* tests/test/Test.pm (test_vector): Add several tests to check
	the above.  Syntax errors now exit with status 2, not 1.
	* man/Makefile.am (mapped_name): Use `../src/[' binary to create test.1.

2003-07-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/help-version: Adjust for above change in test behavior:
	`[' exits with 2, not 1, and test doesn't accept --help or --version.

	* Makefile.maint (ME): Don't use trick suggested in Make manual.
	It doesn't work for make-3.79.1.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* Makefile.maint (sc_system_h_headers): Another syntax check.
	(syntax-check-rules): Add it to the list.

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Cast strlen value to `unsigned long'
	so it matches `%ld' format even on 32-bit systems.

	* src/fmt.c (flush_paragraph): Cast field width to `int' to
	avoid warning on 64-bit systems.

	* src/ls.c (sort_files): Make `func' volatile, so it can't be
	clobbered by a `longjmp' into this function.

2003-07-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (validate_path): Use %ld format (not %d) for size_t
	value.

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Disable the --line-bytes=$_4gb test,
	because it'd evoke spurious failure on 64-bit systems.

2003-07-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/dd.c (usage): Document the fact that SIGUSR1 makes dd
	output its current record counts.  Reported by Jurriaan.

	* tests/wc/Test.pm (test_vector): Disable the `PIPE' tests when running
	`wc' with no options.  This goes along with the change of 2003-07-20.

2003-07-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't include headers already included by system.h:
	* src/tr.c: Don't include errno.h.
	* src/true.c: Don't include version-etc.h.

	* uniq.c, uptime.c, users.c, wc.c, who.c, whoami.c, yes.c:
	Don't include closeout.h.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Add a check for whether $NON_ROOT_USERNAME
	can access the required version of rm.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define PACKAGE_VERSION.

	* tests/cut/Test.pm (out-delim3a): New test.

	* man/help2man: Update to version 1.33.

	* src/expand.c (parse_tabstops): Detect overflow in tabstop sizes.

	* src/dircolors.c: Include xstrndup.h.
	(xstrndup): Remove function, now that it's been factored out into
	it's own file.

2003-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/wc.c (wc): Fix typo in computation of file from file_x,
	which caused the former to be used uninitialized if file_x was
	nonzero.

2003-07-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Use xcalloc in place of xmalloc+memset.

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Substitute 's,$t/$*,$*,' on output of
	help2man, to avoid having `rm.td/rm' appear in rm.1.  Reported by
	Thomas Luzat.  See http://bugs.debian.org/202413 for details.

	* src/cut.c (main) [lint]: Initialize spec_list_string to avoid warning.

	* src/hostid.c: Don't include <unistd.h>.  system.h already does that.

	* src/cut.c (set_fields): Mark all selected indices before trying to
	determine range endpoints.
	* tests/cut/Test.pm: New test for the above fix.

	Begin to address this comment: What if someone wants to
	extract the 1,000,000-th field of some huge input file?
	The first step is to rearrange things so that the values
	in the printable_field array are all 0/1 rather than 0/1/2.
	* src/cut.c (RANGE_START_SENTINEL): Remove.
	Store range-start indices in a hash table, rather than
	overloading the `printable_field' array.
	(range_start_ht): New global.
	(hash_int, hash_compare_ints, is_range_start_index): New functions.
	(print_kth): Use is_range_start_index; don't test printable_field.
	(set_fields): Detect overflow.
	(set_fields): Insert each range-start index into range_start_ht.
	(main): Call set_fields only once, and only after
	output_delimiter_specified and (if required) range_start_ht have
	been defined.

2003-07-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/wc.c (get_input_fstatus): Fix typo: `stat' was being
	invoked with a null pointer when there were no file arguments.

2003-07-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (sc_changelog): Add another nit-picky check.

	* src/wc.c (write_counts): Add a comment.
	(wc): Rename `file' parameter.
	Set new local, `file', to be the file name, or (when it's NULL)
	_("standard output") so that all uses of `file' use the proper value.
	Use STREQ, not strcmp.

2003-07-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	wc count field widths now are heuristically adjusted depending
	on the input size, if known.  If only one count is printed, it
	is guaranteed to be printed without leading spaces.

	Previously, wc did not align the count fields if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT was set, but POSIX did not actually require
	this undesirable behavior, so it has been removed.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (wc invocation): Likewise.

	* src/wc.c (number_width): New var.
	(posixly_correct): Remove.
	(struct fstatus): New struct.
	(write_counts): Output fields of width number_width.
	Do not worry about POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	Use null file, not empty-string file, to denote stdin,
	since "" is a valid file name on some hosts.
	(wc, wc_file): New arg fstatus.  Use it to avoid invoking fstat
	if possible.
	(wc):  Avoid problems if end_pos - current_pos overflows.
	Do not print odd message if stdin has a read error.
	(get_input_fstatus, compute_number_width): New functions.
	(main): Use them to implement the new behavior.
	Ignore POSIXLY_CORRECT.

	* tests/wc/Test.pm: Adjust to the new output widths.

2003-07-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Don't create temporary directory --
	we don't use it.

	* tests/shred/remove: Don't open-code test for UID != 0.
	Use priv-check's require-non-root instead.
	Update to use newer framework.

	* tests/help-version (expected_failure_status_expr): Record that
	expr exits with status of 3 for e.g., a write error.

	* tests/priv-check: Use `id -u' to see if we're running as root,
	rather than trying go write to an write-protected file.
	When running as root, ensure $NON_ROOT_USERNAME is valid.
	When running as root with `require-non-root', ensure that `.'
	is writable by $NON_ROOT_USERNAME, then reinvoke $0 set-user-ID
	to $NON_ROOT_USERNAME.  If `.' is not writable, then skip the test.

	* src/printenv.c: Include "exitfail.h".
	(main): Set exit_failure rather than calling close_stdout_set_status.
	* src/date.c: Likewise.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	* src/tty.c: Likewise.

2003-07-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/touch/not-owner: Update to use newer framework.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Use $srcdir/../priv-check, create a temporary
	directory, and remove Perl-coded `you may not run as root' test.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Use $srcdir/../priv-check, rather than
	hard-coding something not quite equivalent.
	Paul Jarc reported the inconsistent diagnostics.

	* src/sort.c (main): Use close_stdout via atexit.
	Now `sort --version' and `sort --help' fail, as they should
	when their output is redirected to /dev/full.

	* src/su.c (usage): Don't call close_stdout here.
	(main): Use close_stdout via atexit.
	Now `su --version > /dev/full' fails, as it should.
	Somehow, the change of 2000-05-07 that purports to fix this
	was not checked in.

	* tests/help-version (--help/--version vs. /dev/full): Special-case
	`[' to protect it from expected_failure_status-`eval'.

	* src/uniq.c (writeline): Use a SPACE, not a TAB between the
	count and the corresponding line, as required by POSIX.
	Reported by Clement Wang.
	* tests/uniq/Test.pm (101, 102): Update tests of -c accordingly.

	* tests/expr/basic: Add tests for when exit status is 2.

	* src/nohup.c (NOHUP_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE, NOHUP_FAILURE):
	Use an anonymous `enum', rather than #define.

2003-07-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/expr.c: Include "exitfail.h", "quotearg.h".
	(EXPR_INVALID, EXPR_ERROR): New constants.
	(nomoreargs, null, toarith, nextarg): Return bool, not int.
	(syntax_error): New function, exiting with status 2.  Use it
	insteading of printing "syntax error" ourselves.
	(main): Initialize exit_failure to EXPR_ERROR.
	Exit with EXPR_INVALID on syntax error (too few arguments).
	(nextarg): Use strcmp, not strcoll; strcoll might return
	an undesirable 0, or might fail.
	(docolon, eval4, eval3): Exit with status 3 on invalid argument type
	or other such error.
	(eval2): Report an error if strcoll fails in a string comparison.
	* src/sort.c: Include "exitfail.h".
	(main): Set exit_failure, not xalloc_exit_failure and
	xmemcoll_exit_failure.
	* tests/expr/basic: Invalid value exits with status 3, not 2.

2003-07-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Use 5.0.90 as the version, rather than 5.0.2,
	per GNU maintainer guidelines.  The next non-beta release will be 5.1.

	This script would have caught at least two recent bugs:
	those in [ and kill.
	* tests/help-version: Revive this script.
	It wasn't doing anything useful, since $all_programs wasn't being
	defined by the invoking Makefile.am.
	Reflect that nohup is no longer a script, so don't exclude it.
	Add framework to handle the programs added since it was last run:
	kill, stat, unlink, [, link, readlink.
	Fix path-related problems deriving from the move of this script
	from src/ to its present location.
	* tests/Makefile.am (all_programs): Define.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Use it.

	* src/kill.c (main): Fix bug introduced on 2003-05-10 (for 5.0.1)
	whereby kill would always attempt to operate on argv[0] and fail.

	* src/test.c (integer_expected_error): Improve diagnostic -- now,
	it also matches the one from bash's builtin test.
	(binary_operator): Add \n at end of diagnostic.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Remove setuidgid-related code.  Move it to ...
	* tests/priv-check: Move setuidgid-related and
	NON_ROOT_USERNAME-checking code to this file.

	* README: Update section on testing as `root'.
	Suggestion from Paul Jarc.

	* src/test.c (AUTHORS): Replace 3-letter usernames with the actual
	names of authors that I just found in bash's builtins/test.def.

	Running `[' with no arguments would evoke a segfault.
	* src/test.c (main) [LBRACKET]: Move initialization of argv to
	precede potential use via test_syntax_error.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Rename from `INCLUDES', to avoid
	warning from automake -Wall.

2003-07-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.1.

	* Makefile.maint (%.asc): Remove target first, so gpg doesn't
	prompt us about it.

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Relax tests for matching
	version-number line in NEWS.
	Change the .sig suffix to .asc here, too.

2003-07-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (%.asc): Renamed from %.sig.
	Generate and use ascii-armored signatures.
	Use gpg's -o option.

2003-07-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/nohup.c (NOHUP_FAILURE, NOHUP_FOUND_BUT_CANNOT_INVOKE): Define.
	(main): Use them.

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Move each individual check into
	its own target.
	(syntax-check-rules): This is the list of syntax-check targets.
	(sc_unmarked_diagnostics, sc_cast_of_argument_to_free):
	(sc_cast_of_x_alloc_return_value, sc_space_tab):
	(sc_error_exit_success, sc_xalloc_h_in_src):  New targets.

2003-07-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Remove uses of OPTIONAL_BIN_ZCRIPTS and last
	traces of the nohup script.

	* src/Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): Remove use of just-removed
	$(OPTIONAL_BIN_ZCRIPTS).

	* src/Makefile.am (localedir.h): Put the `2>&1' after the redirect
	target, not before the `>'.

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Give a diagnostic upon failed save_cwd,
	now that that function no longer calls `error'.

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Emit a diagnostic for each
	failed syscall, rather than relying on caller to do that.
	The caller couldn't do a good job, anyhow -- too many different
	ways to fail (each with a different referent).
	Give a diagnostic upon failed save_cwd, now that that function
	no longer calls `error'.
	(show_point): Don't diagnose find_mount_point's errors, now that
	it handles them itself.

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Don't let free clobber errno upon
	failed chdir.

	* src/sys2.h: Remove alloca-related block.
	* src/system.h: Include <alloca.h> here, instead.

	It appears that the `#pragma alloca' included via "system.h" is
	adequate, since join.c uses alloca, yet lacked an in-file #pragma.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp.c, src/df.c, src/install.c, src/ln.c:
	* src/ls.c, src/mv.c, src/remove.c: Remove `#pragma alloca'.

	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Do not restore any special
	permission bits (e.g., set-user-ID, set-group-ID) that are reset
	by chown(2) on some systems.  Suggestion and insistence :-) from
	Michael Stone.

	* tests/input-tty: Also check `test -t 1'.
	This is necessary on linux-2.4.21.  Otherwise, the stty/basic-1
	test would block when run in the background.

2003-07-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/sample-test: Also fail if cat-to-create-expected-output
	fails.  Otherwise, if both `exp' and `out' were to end up empty
	because of e.g., a full disk, they would mistakenly compare equal.

	* src/nohup.c: New file.  Rewrite of nohup.sh in C.
	This solves a portability problem: on at least Solaris systems,
	when nohup.sh used the vendor /bin/sh, it would exit with status
	of `1' rather than the required 126 or 127 upon failure to exec
	the specified program.

	* src/Makefile.am (EXTRA_SCRIPTS): Remove definition.
	(bin_PROGRAMS): Add nohup.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Remove nohup.sh.
	(all_programs): Remove use of $(EXTRA_SCRIPTS).
	* src/nohup.sh: Remove file.
	* man/Makefile.am (nohup.1): Depend on nohup.c, rather than nohup.sh.

	* tests/misc/nohup: Tests for the above.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add nohup.

	* src/head.c (diagnose_copy_fd_failure): New function, renamed from
	the macro, COPY_FD_DIAGNOSE.
	(diagnose_copy_fd_failure): Enclose diagnostic in _(...).
	(head_file): Likewise.

	* src/date.c: Include "quote.h".
	(batch_convert): Use the quote function rather than using literal `...'
	in a diagnostic.

	* src/setuidgid.c (main): Enclose diagnostic in _(...).
	* src/fmt.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/mknod.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tac.c (tac_seekable): Likewise.
	* src/yes.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (change_attributes): Likewise.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Now that we have setuidgid, use it in
	place of the kludge in this test.  Suggestion from Paul Jarc.

	* src/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): Define to setuidgid.
	* src/setuidgid.c: New program, solely for testing (not installed).

	(__SOURCES): New var.
	* src/test.c (LBRACKET): Define to 0 if not defined.
	(main): Use LBRACKET rather than argv[0].

	Reported by Paul Jarc and Dan Jacobson.

	* src/test.c (main): Do not recognize --help or --version if

2003-07-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c (print_line): Rewrite to use asprintf, in order to be
	able to avoid emitting trailing spaces.  Reported by Dan Jacobson.

	* tests/misc/head-elide-tail: Add tests of head's new --lines=-N
	option, and perform the +1600 invocations of head IFF the envvar
	RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS is set.

2003-07-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Give a better diagnostic when failing due

	See http://bugs.debian.org/199730 for details.

2003-06-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	split's --verbose option did nothing [broken in 4.5.10 and 5.0]
	* src/split.c (longopts): Use `1', not `0' as the value for
	&verbose.  Reported by Keith Thompson.

	Test for the above fix.
	* tests/misc/split-a: Also use --verbose and compare stderr
	output with what we'd expect.

2003-06-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_AUTHOR]:

	Reflect renaming: getstr -> getdelim2.

	* src/comm.c, src/join.c, src/nl.c, src/uniq.c: Reflect renaming:
	readline -> readlinebuffer.

2003-06-09  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	* src/readlink.c: Include <sys/types.h> before system.h (because
	the latter includes <sys/stat.h>).  Required on Ultrix 4.3.

2003-06-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h (initialize_main): Define.
	Use it in every `main'.  Applied via this:
	p='initialize_main (&argc, &argv);'
	perl -ni -e '/program_name.=.argv.0/ and print "  '"$p"'\n"; print' \
	  $(grep -l program_name.=.argv.0 *.c)
	test.c uses margc/margv, so I made the change manually for that file.
	Based on a patch from Bernard Giroud.

2003-06-09  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	Fix for build failure on Ultrix 4.3.

	* src/cat.c (cat): Remove `#ifndef ENOSYS', now that it's
	guaranteed to be defined.
	* src/system.h (ENOSYS, ENOTSUP): Define to -1 if not defined.

	* README: Mention the CVS repository.
	Encourage addition of test cases.

2003-06-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/touch.c (touch): Call close only if necessary.
	From Bruno Haible.

	* src/wc.c (usage): Correct wording: wc prints counts in the order
	`newline, word, byte'.  Reported by Keith M. Briggs.
	* man/wc.x: Fix it here, too.  And change `lines' to `newlines'.

2003-06-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	rule.

2003-06-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	so this script works also with e.g., perl5.005_03.
	Patch by John David Anglin.

2003-06-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/system.h: Include <stdbool.h> unconditionally.

	(check-programs-vs-1): New phony target.
	(check-local): Depend on it.

2003-06-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Avoid unnecessary copying of environment.
	* src/env.c (main): Rather than clearing the environment and --
	unless told to ignore environment -- copying all settings from
	the saved, original environment, clear the environment only when
	that is requested.  Suggested by Jens Elkner.

2003-06-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/system.h: Always include <string.h>, since we assume C89.

	* src/extract-magic: Allow expansion of `$file' in the here-
	document corresponding to the comment at the top of fs.h.

2003-05-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Fix portability problem on FreeBSD5.0: don't include
	<sys/statvfs.h> on systems without HAVE_STRUCT_STATVFS_F_BASETYPE.

	BSD-style checksum files.

2003-05-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/head.c (usage): Document new feature: --bytes=-N and --lines=-N.

	* tests/du/slink: Skip this test if `.' is on an XFS file system.

	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fd-leak.

	* src/head.c (AUTHORS): Enclose string in N_(...), now that it

	* src/dd.c (usage): Don't use `,' as the thousands separator
	in e.g. 1,000,000 and 1,048,576.  Instead, do this:

2003-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix uniq to conform to POSIX, which requires that "uniq -d -u"
	must output nothing.  Problem reported by Josh Hyman.

	* src/uniq.c (enum output_mode, mode): Remove, replacing with:
	(output_unique, output_first_repeated, output_later_repeated):
	New vars.  All uses of "mode" changed to use these variables,
	which are not mutually exclusive as "mode" was.
	(writeline): New arg "match", used to control whether to
	obey output_first_repeated or output_later_repeated.
	All callers changed.
	(check_file, main): Adjust to above changes.

	* tests/uniq/Test.pm: Test that 'uniq -d -u' outputs nothing.

2003-05-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/rm3: Use tr's \n notation rather than \012.
	This package can afford to do that, since its tests are guaranteed use
	GNU tr, which has accepted the more modern notation for 10 years.
	* tests/rm/rm5: Likewise.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Likewise.
	* tests/stty/row-col-1: Likewise.

	(pipe_lines): Change type of parameter, n_lines, to uintmax_t.
	Rewrite newline-counting loop to use memchr.

	* src/head.c (elide_tail_lines_pipe): Use `if', not assert.
	Now that assert is no longer used, don't include <assert.h>.

2003-05-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Check for `error (EXIT_SUCCESS,'.

	* src/readlink.c (main): Set program_name before first use.
	Remove that (redundant) first use.
	Don't exit successfully just because --verbose was specified.
	Pass 0, not EXIT_SUCCESS, as first argument to error; when that
	parameter is 0, error does not exit.

	* src/uname.c (main): When failing due to too many arguments, also say
	that, rather than just "Try `uname --help' for more information.".
	* src/comm.c (main): Likewise, but for too few arguments.
	* src/logname.c: Include error.h.
	(main): Say why we're failing.

	That would happen when invoked via: execl ("/usr/bin/sort", NULL);
	Reported by Wartan Hachaturow.

2003-05-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Implement support so that `head --lines=-N' works on seekable files.

	(COPY_FD_DIAGNOSE): New macro.
	(elide_tail_lines_seekable): New funtion.
	(elide_tail_lines_file): Call it here.

2003-05-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (CHAR_BIT): Remove duplicate definition.

2003-05-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/head/Test.pm: Remove tests of --bytes=-N; using that framework
	caused the addition of thousands of small files to the tar archive.
	* tests/misc/head-elide-tail: New file.  Add them here instead.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add head-elide-tail.

2003-05-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/remove.c (HAVE_WORKING_READDIR): Define to 0 if not defined.
	(IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR): Remove.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Rewrite to avoid IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR,
	which was a bit weird because it couldn't be emulated by a function.

2003-05-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Extend head to accept --lines=-N (--bytes=-N) and to print all
	but the N lines (bytes) at the end of the file.
	* src/head.c: Include full-write.h, full-read.h, inttostr.h, quote.h.
	Use quote() in diagnostics, rather than literal `' marks.
	(copy_fd, elide_tail_bytes_pipe, elide_tail_bytes_file):
	New functions.
	(elide_tail_lines_pipe, elide_tail_lines_file): New functions.

	(main): Likewise, for head_file.
	Handle new, undocumented option, --presume-input-pipe.
	Handle negative line and byte counts.
	* tests/head/Test.pm: Add lots of tests to exercise --bytes=-N.

	* tests/du/8gb: Skip test if the file system of `.' doesn't support

2003-05-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/fmt.c (usage): Don't mention obsolescent -WIDTH option.
	Instead explain about `-' and standard input.

	* tests/fmt/basic: Add test for the above fix.

	* src/fmt.c (main): Diagnose invalid suffix on obsolescent width
	specifications like `-72x'.
	* tests/fmt/basic: Add test for the above fix.

	Work around nasty readdir bug on Darwin6.5.
	* src/remove.c (IF_READDIR_NEEDS_REWINDDIR): Define.
	[! HAVE_WORKING_READDIR] (remove_cwd_entries): If readdir has just
	returned NULL and there has been at least one successful unlink or
	rmdir call since the opendir or previous rewinddir, then call
	rewinddir and reiterate the loop.

	Factor out common code.
	* src/remove.c (readdir_ignoring_dotdirs): New function.
	(is_empty_dir): Use it here.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Use it here.

2003-05-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/rm/r-3: Create 500 rather than just 300 files.
	There's a bug in Darwin6.5's readdir that shows up only with
	338 or more files.
	Fix a bug in this test: `cd $pwd' (not to `..'), now that $tmp
	has two components.

	* src/tail.c:
	Change type of n_units, n_bytes, n_lines to be `uintmax_t'.
	(dump_remainder): Move two declarations `down' into the scope
	where they are used.
	(xlseek): Return the resulting offset.
	(file_lines): Rename parameter, file_length, to end_pos.
	(pipe_lines): Don't coerce safe_read return value to `int'.
	Adapt tests accordingly.
	(pipe_bytes) [struct charbuffer] (nbytes): Change type from `int'
	to `unsigned int'.
	Change type of `total_bytes' from `int' to `size_t',
	since the former wouldn't always be wide enough.
	Don't coerce safe_read return value to `int',
	and adapt tests accordingly.
	Now that testing for a read error no longer involves
	using `tmp', handle that case *after* freeing `tmp'.
	(start_bytes): Clean up.
	(tail_bytes): Now that `n_bytes' may be larger than
	OFF_T_MAX, test for that condition and, if it's true, don't
	use lseek optimizations.
	(parse_options): Don't fail just because N_UNITS is larger than
	the maximum size of a file -- tail may be applied to an input
	stream (e.g., a pipe) with more data than that.

	* Makefile.maint (syntax-check): Rename from alloc-check.
	Also check for SPACE-TAB sequences.
	Also check for malloc/calloc/realloc casts.

2003-05-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

2003-04-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Fix printf POSIX compatibility bug reported by Ben Harris in
	<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-04/msg00070.html>.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (printf invocation): It's \NNN in the format,
	\0NNN in the %b operand.
	* src/printf.c (usage): Likewise.
	(print_esc): New arg OCTAL0 to specify whether \0NNN or \NNN
	is desired.  All uses changed.  Behave like Bash printf if %b
	operand uses \NNN where the initial N is not 0.

2003-04-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Don't closedir (NULL).

2003-04-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Giving nl an invalid STYLE argument (in --header-numbering=STYLE (-h),
	--body-numbering=STYLE (-b), or --footer-numbering=STYLE (-f)) or
	FORMAT (--number-format=FORMAT (-n)) would not give a useful diagnostic.
	* src/nl.c (main): Fix those problems and remove literal quote marks
	(e.g., "`%s'") from format string; instead use "%s" in each format
	string and `quote (optarg)' as the corresponding argument.
	Also, diagnose all invalid command line options before failing.

	* src/nl.c (proc_text): Fix a bug that would make nl output extra
	newlines in some cases.  Details here: http://bugs.debian.org/177256.
	This bug was introduced on 2001-11-10 for textutils-2.0.17.
	* tests/misc/nl: Add test for the above-fixed bug.

	* tests/misc/readlink: New file.  Test the --canonicalize option.

	* src/test.c, src/unexpand.c: Remove (or replace-with-TAB(s) to
	retain alignment) each sequence of spaces before a TAB character.

	* src/ls.c: Include <stdlib.h> unconditionally.

	* Makefile.maint (xalloc-check): Rename from header-check.

	* src/yes.c: Include error.h after system.h, not before.

	Clean up.
	* src/copy.c, src/cp-hash.c, src/cp.c, src/csplit.c, src/cut.c:
	* src/date.c, src/df.c, src/du.c, src/expand.c, src/expr.c, src/id.c:

	* src/tr.c: * src/unexpand.c, src/users.c:
	Remove anachronistic casts of xmalloc, xrealloc, and xcalloc
	return values and of xrealloc's first argument.
	Fix the former with this:
	perl -pi -e 's/\([^(]*?\*\) *(x(m|c|re)alloc)\b/$1/'

2003-04-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stty.c (wrapf): Declare with format attribute.

	The S_MAGIC_... names shouldn't be maintained in two places (prior
	to this change, one would have to keep stat.c and fs.h in sync).
	This change makes it so those names and the corresponding
	hexadecimal constants all reside in stat.c.  fs.h is now generated.
	* src/Makefile.am (fs.h): New rule to generate fs.h from stat.c.
	(BUILT_SOURCES): Add fs.h, now that it's generated.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add extract-magic.
	* src/extract-magic: New script to extract fs.h definitions from stat.c.
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype) [__linux__]: Append each hex constant from
	fs.h in a comment after the corresponding `case S_MAGIC_...:' statement.

	* tests/tail-2/big-4gb: Skip this test (don't fail) if creating a
	file with nominal length > 4GB fails.  Reported by Michael Deutschmann.

	* man/unexpand.x: Add `SEE ALSO' reference to expand.
	* man/expand.x: Add `SEE ALSO' reference to unexpand.
	Suggestion from Dan Jacobson.

2003-04-10  Maciej W. Rozycki  <macro@ds2.pg.gda.pl>

	* src/fs.h (S_MAGIC_DEVPTS): New magic for Linux's devpts.
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Handle Linux's devpts.

2003-04-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/split.c (line_bytes_split): Arg is of type size_t, since
	that's all that is supported for now.
	(main): Check for overflow in obsolescent line count option.

2003-04-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/split-fail: Add a new test for the above fix.

	* src/split.c (bytes_split): Use size_t temporary (rather than
	uintmax_t original) in remaining computations.  From Paul Eggert.

	Handle command line option arguments larger than 2^31.
	This allows e.g., splitting into files of size 2GB and larger,
	and running split --lines=N with N=2^31 or more.
	But for --line-bytes=N, the restriction that N <= SIZE_MAX
	remains (for now), due to the way it is implemented.

	* src/split.c: Include "inttostr.h".
	(bytes_split, lines_split, line_bytes_split, main):
	Use uintmax_t, not size_t, for file sizes.
	(main): Give a better diagnostic for option arguments == 0.
	Use umaxtostr to print file sizes.
	Reported by Luke Hassell.

2003-04-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/rm.c (usage): Mention that --directory (-d) works only
	on some systems.  Suggestion from Samuel Tardieu.

	* tests/basename/basic: Run $PERL to see if it is available,
	rather than testing its value.
	* tests/sum/sysv, tests/tsort/basic-1, tests/unexpand/basic-1:
	* tests/basename/basic, tests/dd/skip-seek, tests/dircolors/simple:
	* tests/expr/basic, tests/factor/basic, tests/fmt/basic:

	* tests/rm/empty-name, tests/rm/fail-eperm, tests/rm/unreadable:
	* tests/seq/basic, tests/sha1sum/basic-1, tests/sha1sum/sample-vec:
	* tests/sum/basic-1, tests/seq/basic: Likewise.

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add split-fail.
	* tests/misc/split-fail: New file.

	* src/split.c: Rename local variables: nchars -> n_bytes.
	(lines_split): Rename local, nlines -> n_lines.
	(main): Rename local variable: s/accum/n_units/.
	(main): Use STDIN_FILENO, not literal `0'.

2003-04-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Add #include directives for Ultrix 4.4.
	Based on a suggested change from Bert Deknuydt.

2003-04-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (makefile-check): New rule.
	(local-check): Add it.

2003-04-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (nearly all of them):
	Use $(VAR) rather than @VAR@, now that we can rely on automake to
	emit a definition for each substituted variable.
	* tests/Makefile.am.in: Likewise.

	* tests/rm/rm5: Add a comment explaining why this test fails when
	using Tru64's broken sed.
	* tests/rm/rm3: Likewise.

	Make `kill -t' output signal descriptions (not `?') on Tru64.
	* src/kill.c (sys_siglist): Also check for __sys_siglist.
	Patch by Tony Leneis.
	* configure.ac: Also check for declaration of __sys_siglist.
	Required for Tru64 4.0D, 4.0F, and 5.1.
	Reported by Tony Leneis.

2003-04-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (PERL): Remove unnecessary definition.

	Because of inappropriate (but POSIX-mandated) behavior of rename,
	`mv a b' would not remove `a' in some unusual cases.  Work around
	this by unlinking `a' when necessary.

	* src/copy.c (same_file_ok): Add an output parameter.
	Set it in the offending case.
	(copy_internal): When necessary, unlink SRC_PATH and inform caller.
	Reported by Ed Avis.
	* tests/mv/hard-4: New test for the above.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-4.

	Clean up rules for automatically generated sources:
	* src/Makefile.am (dircolors.h, wheel-size.h, wheel.h, false.c):
	Make each generated file be read-only.
	Add each file name to BUILT_SOURCES separately.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Set to $(BUILT_SOURCES).

	Put LOCALEDIR macro definition in new file: localedir.h.
	* src/Makefile.am (DEFS): Remove definition.
	(localedir.h): New rule.
	(BUILT_SOURCES, DISTCLEANFILES): Add localedir.h.
	* src/system.h: Include "localedir.h".

2003-04-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 5.0.

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add false.

	* Makefile.maint (TMPDIR): Make sure it's defined.
	(my-distcheck): Build in $(TMPDIR), not `.'.

	* src/Makefile.am (false.c): Change all occurrences of
	`(EXIT_SUCCESS)' to `(EXIT_FAILURE)' so that false exits
	unsuccessfully also with --help.  Reported by Paul Jarc,
	* tests/misc/false: New test for the above.

2003-03-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* NEWS: Note the location of older NEWS files.

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): Don't let a failing closedir
	clobber errno.  Spotted by Arnold Robbins.

	* src/env.c: Fix typo in comment.  From Arnold Robbins.

2003-03-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.12.

	* README: Note to expect build problems for stat.c on Ultrix 4.3.
	Note that there are some harmless test failures when running
	`make check' as root on some systems.

2003-03-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/stty/row-col-1: Skip this test if stty can't get window size.
	This happens when connecting to sparc-solaris5.7 via ssh from within
	emacs.  Reported by Karl Berry.

	* tests/du/basic: Use seq, not `yes' to generate 4KB of data.
	Otherwise, on systems (DJGPP) that emulate pipes using files,
	this test would never complete, waiting for `yes' to terminate.
	* tests/du/slink: As above, use seq, not `yes' to generate link target.
	* tests/rm/hash: As above, use seq, not `yes' to generate dir name.
	Reported by Rich Dawe.

2003-03-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/id.c: Remove Arnold Robbins' obsolete e-mail address
	from `written by...' comment, at his request.

2003-03-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix buffer overrun problem reported by TAKAI Kousuke, along
	with some other POSIX incompatibilities.

	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Do not treat \x specially if
	POSIXLY_CORRECT.  Avoid buffer overrun if the format ends
	in backslash.  Treat incomplete escape sequences as strings
	of characters, as POSIX requires.
	(print_formatted): Allow multiple flags.  Avoid buffer overrun
	if the format is incomplete.

2003-03-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/printf: Add tests for the above fixes and changes.

2003-03-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options): Add a comment.

2003-03-23  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Describe problem with 64-bit mode on HPUX 11.x,
	with patch for /usr/include/inttypes.h.
	* TODO: Plan to add an autoconf test to work around the bug.

2003-03-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Don't include <sys/sysmacros.h>.
	That is already done via system.h.  Otherwise, the multiple
	inclusion would evoke redefinition warnings from Cray's /bin/cc,
	aka Cray Standard C Version 4.0.3  (057126) Mar 22 2003  22:02:28.
	(human_fstype): Factor some directives `up', out of this function.
	Cast away `const' to avoid error from Cray's /bin/cc.

2003-03-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): Ensure that a newline
	precedes each row of `*'s.

2003-03-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.11.

	* src/seq.c (valid_format): Also accept ` ' and `'' as valid
	format flag characters.
	Do not require that a field width be specified.
	Do not fail when given a field width of `0'.
	Reported by Dan Jacobson.
	* tests/seq/basic: Add new tests for the above-fixed bug.

	* src/Makefile.am (all-local): Append $(EXEEXT) to use of `su'
	(install-root): Likewise.
	(install-exec-local): Likewise.
	Based on a patch from Richard Dawe.

2003-03-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Use $(LN_S) instead of 'ln -s',
	because the DJGPP 2.03 port of 'ln -s' doesn't work.
	Include $(EXEEXT) in program names.
	Since $(LN_S) may degenerate to `cp -p', be careful
	to invoke it from the destination directory.
	Mostly from Richard Dawe.
	* configure.ac: Use AC_PROG_LN_S.

	* tests/mv/part-symlink: Unset CDPATH.  Otherwise, having the
	CDPATH shell variable set could cause this test to fail.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

2003-03-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/fmt.c [struct Word] (paren, period, punct, final): Change the
	type of each member from bool <MEMBER>:1 to unsigned int <MEMBER>:1.
	AIX 5.1's xlc could not compile the former.
	Patch by Petter Reinholdtsen.  Also reported by Mike Jetzer.

2003-03-17  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* configure.ac: Include $(EXEEXT) in OPTIONAL_BIN_PROGS'
	program names, since automake only adds $(EXEEXT) to programs
	in its *_PROGRAMS.

2003-03-16  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (rm): Put two local variables in static storage,
	so they can't be clobbered by the potential longjmp.

2003-03-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.cfg (gnu_rel_host): Fix code to match the comment
	so that a version number with a two-digit component can still count
	as an alpha release.  Reported by Richard A Downing.
	(gnu_rel_host): Define in terms of $(RELEASE_TYPE) instead.

2003-03-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ansi2knr.c: Remove no-longer-used file.
	* src/ansi2knr.1: Likewise.

	* Makefile.maint (prev_version_file): Don't use ?= for this particular
	assignment, since it causes trouble with old versions of GNU make
	(e.g. 3.76.1).  The other uses of `?=' are inoffensive.  Details here.
	http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2003-03/msg00028.html
	Patch from Alexandre Duret-Lutz.

	* Use patched automake-1.7.3.  Regenerate Makefile.in files in
	subdirectories so that each includes a definition of ACLOCAL_M4.

	* announce-gen (main): Label the compressed source URLs.

	* Version 4.5.10.

	* tests/du/slink: Relax the test for the `local'ness of a file system,
	so that now it works also for tmpfs.

	* tests/du/hard-link: Transform output from first du, so that this
	test doesn't fail on file systems like tmpfs that order directory
	entries differently.

2003-03-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/8gb: Work around what appears to be an NFS failure that
	would make this test fail on some systems.

2003-03-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/basic: Make the test file exactly 4k bytes long.

	* src/split.c (longopts): Don't hard-code `2' here.
	Instead, just specify `&verbose', and ...
	(main): ... remove the `case 2:' block for --verbose.

	* tests/du/basic: Make the test file larger than 64 bytes, so that
	we don't immediately disqualify file systems (e.g., NetApp) on which
	smaller files take up zero disk blocks.  Reported by Vin Shelton.

2003-03-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Don't segfault for a negative field width or precision in format string.
	Note that this is just a stopgap fix.  The longer term solution may
	involve adapting bash's builtins/printf.def.

	* src/printf.c: (UNSPECIFIED): Define.
	(print_direc): Use the special value, UNSPECIFIED, to indicate
	that field_width or precision has not been specified.
	(print_formatted): Fail if field_width or precision is the
	special value, UNSPECIFIED.
	Reported by Oliver Kiddle <okiddle@yahoo.co.uk>

	* src/sys2.h (INT_MIN): Define, if necessary.
	* tests/misc/printf: Add a test for the above-fixed bug.

2003-03-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (AD_stack_pop): Cast sizeof... to int before
	changing its sign.  This avoids a warning from gcc on 64-bit systems.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.
	(pop_dir): Reverse order of sign change and cast, to be consistent
	with the above.

2003-03-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am (evar-check): Check for POSIXLY_CORRECT not as a
	shell variable, but only in the environment.  With /bin/sh->bash, the
	shell variable is set to `y', and that would cause a spurious warning.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Remove touch/fifo.
	It doesn't appear to have to be run as root.

	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: Rather than simply using the first non-root
	user name, make sure that the selected user name has a usable shell.
	Reported by Paul Jarc.

	Before, when using shred on a device, one had to specify --exact,
	or be careful to choose a size that would not be rounded up and
	exceed the maximum value;  that could result in a failure of
	the final write.
	* src/shred.c (do_wipefd): --exact is now the default for non-regular
	files.  Suggestion from Ben Elliston.
	(usage): Say it.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Require at least version 1.11 of Expect.pm.
	Old versions of Expect.pm (e.g., 1.07) lack the log_user function.
	Patch by Bob Proulx.

	* src/Makefile.am (check-misc): Check for use of `defined' in
	#define directives.
	Change to $(srcdir) before running grep.

	* src/sleep.c: Remove now-unused #include and #define directives.

	* src/du.c (process_file): If a file's size is not being counted
	e.g., because it's a hard link to a file we've already counted,
	then don't print a line for it.

	* tests/du/hard-link: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-link.

	`du -S' didn't work
	* src/du.c: Revert most of the `reorganization' change of 2003-02-20,
	and make the two-array approach work.

	* tests/du/basic: Correct/add tests for the above fix.
	Set LC_ALL, etc., now that we use sort.
	Check the block/size of a small file, too.
	Correct expected results for simple dir1/dir2/file case.
	Add another test of du -S.

2003-03-07  John David Anglin  <dave.anglin@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>

	Avoid build failure with gcc on hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20 (see GCC PR
	middle-end/9986).  As one of GCC's optimizations, it transforms a
	fputs_unlocked call to a fputc_unlocked call when the string is
	one character long.  However, hpux doesn't have fputc_unlocked.

	* expr.c (usage): Use putchar, not fputs, to output a single character.
	* ls.c (dired_dump_obstack): Likewise.
	* ptx.c (output_one_tex_line, output_one_dumb_line): Likewise.
	* stat.c (print_it): Likewise.

2003-03-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cp.c: Remove everything associated with mmap-stack.c.
	This reverts the two changes of 2003-02-21.
	* src/du.c: Remove everything associated with mmap-stack.c.
	This reverts the change of 2003-02-19.

2003-03-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/cp/same-file: Unset CDPATH.  Otherwise, having the
	CDPATH shell variable set could cause this test to fail.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

2003-03-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.9.

	* src/printf.c (print_esc): Remove pointless comparison of unsigned
	integer with zero, to avoid a warning from Intel's ecc.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Sizes must all be of type uintmax_t.
	Otherwise, for files or totals that are too big, numbers would
	be truncated.  Patch mostly by Michael Stone.
	Reported by Ingo Saitz as Debian bug #183210.

	* tests/du/8gb: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add 8gb.

	* src/du.c (MAX_N_DESCRIPTORS): Use 3 * UTILS_OPEN_MAX / 4
	rather than UTILS_OPEN_MAX - 10.

2003-03-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: Refer new feature discussion to bug-coreutils@gnu.org,
	rather than bug-gnu-utils, now that the former is better known.
	Suggestion from Göran Uddeborg.

	* src/stat.c (usage): Capitalize consistently.
	Reported by Göran Uddeborg.

	* Makefile.maint (rel-files): Include $(signatures), so that
	those files are also copied into $(release_archive_dir).

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Call error here, now that restore_cwd
	no longer does it.
	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Likewise.

	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root): Add fail-2eperm.

2003-03-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Include the full filename of
	the offending file, not just the basename.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Set $ME properly.

	* Makefile.maint (THIS_VERSION_REGEXP, PREV_VERSION_REGEXP):
	Remove now-unused variables.
	(tag-prev-version, prev-cvs-tag): Likewise.

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries) [!ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS]: Give an
	accurate diagnostic when failing to remove a file owned by some other
	user.  Reported by Ivo Timmermans via Michael Stone.
	This fixes Debian bug# 178471.

	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fail-2eperm.
	* tests/rm/fail-2eperm: New test, for the above-fixed bug.
	Based on a report from Ivo Timmermans.

2003-03-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [un_backup]: When recovering from a
	failure to create a hard link, do not remove the entry associating
	the source dev/ino with the destination file name.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-3.
	* tests/mv/hard-3: New test, for the above-fixed bug.
	Inspired by a report from Iida Yosiaki.

2003-03-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/df.c (print_header): Don't embed spaces in a separate `Type'
	header string.  Instead, put `Filesystem' and `Type' headers in the
	same string, so translators can use horizontal space as needed.
	Reported by Jean Charles Delepine.

2003-02-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): When link fails because of an
	existing destination file, unlink that file and try again.
	Reported by Iida Yosiaki.

	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hard-2.
	* tests/mv/hard-2: New test for the above-fixed bug.
	Based on a test case from Iida Yosiaki.

2003-02-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/basic: Don't test du's -b option here.  Directory byte
	counts are smaller (512 rather than 4096) on at least OSF/1 5.1
	and IBM AIX 4.2.  Reported by Nelson Beebe.

2003-02-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Now that ChangeLog entries
	are output by announce-gen, don't do it here.
	* announce-gen (print_changelog_deltas): New function.
	(main): Use it.

2003-02-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* announce-gen: New option: --release-type=TYPE
	* Makefile.maint (beta, major): New targets.  Remove `release'.
	Put them all together on a line.
	Pass the release type (via RELEASE_TYPE envvar) to the MAKE
	invocation of `announcement'.
	(announcement): Invoke announce-gen with --release-type=$RELEASE_TYPE.

	* announce-gen: New option: --news=NEWS_FILE.
	Extract NEWS entries here, not via rules in Makefile.maint.
	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Now that NEWS entries are
	extracted by announce-gen, don't do it here.
	(news-r1, news-r2): Remove now-unused definitions.

2003-02-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.8.

	Merge in changes from autoconf's version of this file.
	* Makefile.maint (www-gnu): Define.
	(standards.texi-url_prefix): Use $(www-gnu).
	(make-stds.texi-url_prefix): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c: Include "mmap-stack.h".
	(main): Invoke `run' through a macro that (when possible) runs it
	with a large, mmap'd stack.

	* src/cp.c (run): New function, preparing for the above.
	Exit from this function, not from main
	(main): Call run.

	* src/du.c: New option: --apparent-size.
	(enum) [APPARENT_SIZE_OPTION]: New member.
	(long_options): Add it.
	(usage): Describe it.
	(main): Handle it.
	['b']: Set apparent_size.
	David Eisner reported that the behavior of --bytes had changed.
	Paul Eggert proposed the use of a new option, --apparent-size.

	* src/du.c (apparent_size): New global.
	(print_only_size): Reflect the fact that we're printing byte counts,
	not ST_NBLOCKSIZE-byte-block counts.
	(print_size): Call print_only_size rather than duplicating its code.
	(process_file): Accumulate byte counts, rather than block counts.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Always reset size_to_propagate_to_parent
	for --separate-dirs (-S).

2003-02-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use automake-1.7.3.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): New format: %B (to print ST_NBLOCKSIZE).
	This makes %b (number of ST_NBLOCKSIZE-byte blocks) more useful.
	(usage) [%B]: Describe it.
	[%b]: Refer to %B.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Reorganize the code to use only
	one `sum' array, and change how -S works back to the way it was
	before 2003-01-31.  Patch by Bruno Haible.

	* tests/du/basic: New test.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add basic.

	* tests/envvar-check: Add checks for the following:
	BLOCK_SIZE, DU_BLOCK_SIZE, DF_BLOCK_SIZE, LS_BLOCK_SIZE.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Rename phony target envvar-check to evar-check
	so as not to conflict with the distributed file by the same name.

	* src/du.c (process_file): Set info->skip before any possible return.

	Report correct usage for directories, not 0.
	* src/du.c (process_file): Return for `file_type == FTW_DPRE'
	_before_ recording the dev/ino of a directory.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	Now, df always displays the device file name corresponding to the
	listed mount point under `Filesystem'.  Before, for an unmounted
	block- or character-special file argument, it would display the
	command-line argument instead.
	* src/df.c (show_disk): Return a value indicating whether
	there was a match.  Don't try to find a mount point here.
	(show_entry): If show_disk doesn't find a match, call show_point.

2003-02-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c: Include "mmap-stack.h".
	(du_files): Add prototype with ATTRIBUTE_NORETURN.
	Exit from this function, not from...
	(main): ...here.
	Instead, if possible, invoke du_files through a macro that
	runs it with a large, mmap'd stack.

	* src/join.c (usage): Change wording in --help output:
	use FILENUM instead of `SIDE' and say what FILENUM means.
	Reported by Bernhard Gabler.

	* src/df.c (print_header): Rather than using a hard-coded literal
	string of spaces matching the length of the English `...Type' header,
	output the right number of spaces to match the selected translation.
	Reported by Yann Dirson and Jean Charles Delepine as Debian bug 131113.

	* src/split.c (bytes_split): Remove unnecessary `else' after break.
	(lines_split): Likewise.  and correct misleading indentation.

	* src/split.c: Include "full-read.h".
	(bytes_split, lines_split, line_bytes_split): Use full_read,
	not safe_read.   The way split was using the latter, a short read
	could cause split to terminate before EOF.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: Test all programs that can read stdin,
	requiring no arguments and that write to standard output.

	* tests/misc/tty-eof: New file.  Renamed from ...
	* tests/misc/cat-tty-eof: Remove file.  Rename to tty-eof.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Reflect renaming.

2003-02-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	cksum would perform an extra read after encountering EOF
	* src/cksum.c (cksum): Exit the loop upon EOF, too.
	Patch by Michael Bacarella.

	Test for the bug fixed today in cksum, md5sum, and sha1sum.
	* tests/misc/cat-tty-eof: Generalize, clean-up, and test for
	cat, cksum, md5sum, and sha1sum all in the same loop.

2003-02-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pathchk.c (portable_chars_only): Remove unnecessary `const'
	in cast to avoid warning from icc.  Reported by Alexandre Duret-Lutz.

2003-02-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c: Don't include group-member.h.
	Include euidaccess.h.
	(eaccess): Rewrite function to set the real uid and gid temporarily
	to the effective uid and gid, then invoke 'access', and then set the
	real uid and gid back.  On systems that lack setreuid or setregid,
	fall back on the kludges in euidaccess.  Before, it would not work
	for e.g., files with ACLs, files that were marked immutable,
	or on file systems mounted read-only.  Nelson Beebe raised the issue.
	Paul Eggert suggested the new implementation.

2003-02-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c (test_stat): Remove function.  It's job is done (only
	when necessary) by the wrapper in lib/stat.c.  Adjust all uses.

	`df /dev/block-or-char-device-file--not-mounted' now reports
	the name of the file system on which the file resides, usually `/'.
	Before, it would leave the `Mounted on' field blank.
	* src/df.c (show_disk): Move function to precede find_mount_point.
	(show_disk): Add parameter: STATP.
	If we don't find a matching device name, then resort to calling
	find_mount_point.  Reported by Bob Proulx.

	(local-check): Add it to the list.

2003-02-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (MAX_N_DESCRIPTORS): Define.

	* src/stat.c (G_fail): New global.

2003-01-31  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* tests/basename/Makefile.am: Use @PATH_SEPARATOR@ instead of
	hard-coding the path-separator.  Also double-quote the new PATH,
	to avoid problems when the path-separator is a semi-colon or when
	`pwd` contains e.g. a space.

2003-01-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/stat.c: Include "file-type.h"
	(print_human_type): Remove function.
	(human_access): Rename from print_human_access.  Return a string.
	(human_time): Rename from print_human_time.  Return a string.
	(print_stat): Arrange so that field width and an alignment specifier
	are honored for the %A, %F, %x, %y, and %z formats.
	[%F]: Use file_type; this gives slightly different file type strings,
	e.g., `directory' instead of `Directory' and `regular file' or
	`regular empty file' instead of `Regular file'.
	Prompted by a report from Richard Dawe that the uses of
	S_IFSOCK and S_IFIFO in print_human_time were not portable
	to systems using e.g., DJGPP.

2003-01-31  Richard Dawe  <rich@phekda.freeserve.co.uk>

	* src/stat.c (print_stat): Use S_ISLNK rather than an explicit
	test using S_IFMT and S_IFLNK.  S_IFLNK may not be defined.

2003-01-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (main): Upon processing an invalid option or an invalid
	--exclude-from or --max-depth option argument, don't exit right away,
	in case there are others.  Rather record the failure and exit after
	processing other options.

	* GNUmakefile (TAR_OPTIONS): Set and export, in order to make
	tar archive easier to reproduce.

	Rewrite to perform directory traversal using nftw.

	* src/du.c: Include "dirname.h", "ftw.h", and "quotearg.h".

	Reported by Richard Dawe.

2003-01-27  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/ls.c (quote_name): Add fourth parameter, width, into which to
	store the screen columns, and return the number of bytes instead.

	(print_name_with_quoting): Likewise.
	(length_of_file_name_and_frills): Get the width from the fourth
	parameter of quote_name instead of return value.

2003-01-27  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): If `dired' is set without
	`format == long_format', then silently reset dired.  This doesn't
	change the behavior of ls (all prior uses of dired were protected
	by `&& format == long_format'), and lets us...
	(DIRED_INDENT): ... remove the `format == long_format' conjunct.
	(PUSH_CURRENT_DIRED_POS): Likewise.
	(main): Likewise.

2003-01-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/du/no-x: New test, for functionality added to lib/ftw.c.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add no-x.

2003-01-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry) [ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS
	&& HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_TYPE]: If a file has d_type == DT_UNKNOWN
	it may still be a directory -- or not (e.g., with FreeBSD on an
	NFS-mounted file system), so resort to calling lstat to find out.
	Based on a patch by Michael van Elst.

	* tests/cp/same-file: Don't assume that the file owner username
	length is less than 9 in ls output: instead, omit that field
	altogether.  Reported by, and suggested fix from, Ferdinand.

2003-01-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/date/Test.pm (wide-fmt): New test to demonstrate that
	large format widths no longer cause strftime to infloop.

	* Makefile.maint (mail_gpg_sign_cookie): Remove now-unused definition.

2003-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/readlink.c: Include "canonicalize.h".

2003-01-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (Dereference_symlink) [DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR]:
	New member.
	(enum) [DEREFERENCE_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR_OPTION]: New member.
	(long_options): Add option --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	(main): Make DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR be the default,
	rather than DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS, when none of the
	-d, -F, -l options is specified.
	(decode_switches): Handle --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	(gobble_file): Honor DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR.
	Change --dereference-command-line (-H) to dereference *all*
	command line arguments, including broken symlinks.

2003-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Change ls -H back to the way it was yesterday, since this is
	compatible with FreeBSD and the POSIX spec is confusing
	and somewhat contradictory.

	* src/ls.c (DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS): Change name back
	from DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR, updating all uses.
	(long_options): Change the long option name back.
	(usage): Change the usage back.
	(gobble_file): When -H is specified, dereference a top-level
	arg even if it points to a non-directory.

2003-01-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Fall back on using lstat when required:
	when --dereference (-L) is not specified, and
	- when operating on a dangling symlink
	- when operating on command-line-symlink-to-directories
	This fixes numerous problems.  Here are examples:
	- `ls dangling-symlink' would fail with `no such file...'
	Now it prints `dangling-symlink'.
	- `ls -i symlink' would mistakenly print the inode of the referent.
	Now it prints the inode of the symlink.  Likewise for --size (-s).
	Based on a patch from Michael Stone.
	Reported by Deepak Goel as Debian bug #173793.

	Rename ls's --dereference-command-line (-H)
	option to   --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.
	* src/ls.c [enum Dereference_symlink]
	(DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_SYMLINK_TO_DIR): Rename from
	DEREF_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS.  Update all uses.
	(long_options): Rename the long option.
	(usage): Say that --dereference-... changes how ls treats
	only symlinks to directories specified on the command line.

2003-01-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/dangle: New file/test, for the above fix.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Fix a bug introduced in 4.5.4 that made it
	so that ls --color would no longer highlight the names of files with
	the execute bit set when not specified on the command line.
	Patch by Michael Stone.  Reported by Stephen Depooter as
	Debian bug 175135.

	* tests/ls-2/tests (color-exe): New test, for the above fix.

2003-01-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (cvs-update): Skip any file with local modifications.

	* src/unexpand.c (usage): Document --first-only and mention that

2002-12-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/touch.c (touch): Change the wording of a diagnostic so
	that it makes sense both when the file exists and when it doesn't.
	Suggestion from Michael Stone.

	to a symlink-to-directory.

2002-12-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use autoconf-2.57.  Regenerate dependent files.
	* Use automake-1.7.2.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* tests/ls/file-type: New file.  Test for the above.
	A test to contrast ls -F and ls --indicator-style=file-type.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add file-type.

2002-12-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/ls/follow-slink: Make sure the symlink was created.

	no file on systems running some version of the DJGPP libc.

2002-12-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove definition (to ansi2knr)

2002-11-30  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* ls.c (gobble_file): Remove the block of code that caused
	`ls --color -F symlink-to-dir' to list the files in
	`symlink-to-dir/.'.  Now, it prints `symlink-to-dir@', (just
	like `ls -F symlink-to-dir') but with the addition of highlighting.
	Similarly, `ls --color -dF symlink-to-dir' would print
	`symlink-to-dir/';  now it prints `symlink-to-dir@'.
	Reported by Jeff Sheinberg as Debian bug #168203.
	* tests/ls-2/tests (sl-F-color, sl-dF-color): New tests for the above.

	ls is now more efficient: with certain options, it no longer needs
	to stat each directory entry on systems with valid dirent.d_type.
	* src/ls.c (print_dir): Add DT_LNK and DT_REG.
	(main): Make --recursive set format_needs_type, not format_needs_stat.

2002-11-24  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/du.c (du_files): Don't strip any trailing slash.
	Rewrite so that `/' is no longer represented internally as
	the empty string.
	(count_entry): When appending a file name component,
	account for the fact that the current path may end in `/'.
	François Pinard reported that `du symlink-to-dir/' was not
	equivalent to `du symlink-to-dir/.'.  Now it is.
	* tests/du/trailing-slash: New file/test, for the above fix.
	* tests/du/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add trailing-slash.

2002-11-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.maint (mail_gpg_sign_cookie): Make optional.
	(announcement): Use the new variable.

	* Makefile.maint: Sync with Bison, i.e.:
	(po-check): Scan .l and .y files instead of the
	.c and the .h files that they generate.  This fixes the bug
	reported by Tim Van Holder in:
	<http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bison-patches/2002-November/001352.html>
	Look for N_ as well as for _.  Try to avoid matching #define for

	* tests/misc/printf: Be careful to test the code in this package,
	not the shell built-in function.

	* src/printf.c (print_esc): A hexadecimal escape sequence has
	at most two hex. digits, not three.  Reported by Padraig Brady.
	(usage): Update description.
	* tests/misc/printf-hex: New file/test, for the above fix.

2002-10-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for locale-specific size indications (e.g.,
	thousands-separators) and for explicit size suffixes on output.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (Block size): Say that:
	This affects display format as well as block size.
	Fractional block counts are rounded up.
	ls file size blocksize defaults to 1.
	A block size spec preceded by ' generates thousands separators.
	A suffix without a preceding integer generates suffixes.
	(tail invocation): 32k -> 32 KiB.
	(What information is listed): ls -h is now equivalent to
	ls --block-size=human, and ls -H is now equivalent to
	ls --block-size=si.  Displayed file size is now always affected by
	--block-size.

	* lib/inttostr.c, lib/inttostr.h, lib/imaxtostr.c, lib/offtostr.c,

	human_base_1024, human_SI, human_B): New enum values.
	(human_readable): Rename from human_readable_inexact; put the
	options before the sizes.  All uses changed.  The old human_readable
	function has been removed; use inttostr.h instead.
	(human_options): Renamed from human_block_size, with new signature
	that allows block sizes up to UINTMAX_MAX.  All callers changed.

	* m4/prereq.m4 (jm_PREREQ_HUMAN): Check for locale.h, localeconv,
	AC_HEADER_STDBOOL.  No need to check for limits.h since it's in
	freestanding C89.  No need to check for stdlib.h or string.h since
	autoconf does this now.

	* src/cksum.c (cksum): Use primitives from inttostr.h, not
	human.h, to print large numbers simply.
	* src/csplit.c (handle_line_error, parse_patterns): Likewise.

	block sizes.  All uses changed.
	* src/du.c: Likewise.
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.

	* src/df.c (print_header): In the header line, prefer SI to human
	representation if it's shorter; if neither is shorter, try to
	intuit what the user would prefer.

	* src/expr.c (inttostr): Remove; use new imaxtostr library
	function instead.

	* src/ls.c (file_output_block_size): New var, to distinguish
	file sizes from other sizes.
	(decode_switches): Set it.

	* src/shred.c (OUTPUT_BLOCK_SIZE): remove.
	(dopass): When printing progress, use floor for what has been done
	so far (since we should be conservative there), and ceiling for
	what needs to be done (since that's what other programs use).

2002-10-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pinky.c (print_heading): Align TTY and Name headings.
	Reported by Karl Eichwalder.

	reproduce HPUX-11 cat failure.  From Petter Reinholdtsen.

2002-10-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Fix a problem that could make e.g., `cat' misbehave on systems which
	give invalid (unreasonably large) values for stat.st_blksize.
	* src/system.h (ST_BLKSIZE): Ensure that the result is in [1..4MB].
	Reported by Petter Reinholdtsen.

2002-10-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Specifying a printf conversion specifer as nl's separator string
	could cause nl to segfault.
	* src/nl.c (build_print_fmt): Don't include separator string
	in the printf format; it might contain `%'.
	Use a better bound on the length of the print_fmt buffer.
	(print_lineno): Print the separator here instead.

2002-10-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/paste.c (paste_parallel): Declare local, `delims_saved', to be
	of type size_t, since that's the way it's used and avoids a warning.

	* src/csplit.c (struct cstring) [len]: Declare to be unsigned int,
	since that's how it's always used and avoids a new warning from gcc.
	(read_input): Adapt to new safe_read ABI.

	* src/cut.c (cut_fields): Add a temporary size_t variable, n_bytes,
	to avoid warnings.

	* src/pinky.c (print_long_entry): fread returns size_t.
	Declare local `bytes' accordingly, to avoid warning.

	tail -c +N would perform an extra read after encountering EOF
	[this change is analogous (bytes vs. lines) to the one of 2002-01-27]
	* src/tail.c (start_bytes): Detect EOF, inform caller.
	(tail_bytes): Upon EOF in start_bytes, return immediately.

	are not set (e.g., SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX).  Reported by Duncan Roe.

	* tests/tail-2/big-4gb: Mark this as an expensive test; it would
	consume 4GB of disk space on systems without support for sparse files.
	Fix a logic error that'd make it `cat err' even though dd didn't fail.

	* src/dircolors.hin (.jar): Fix typo: s/;3$/;31/.
	Patch by steven@magelico.net, forwarded by Michael Stone.

	* tests/ls/dired: Ensure that ls produces English messages.
	Patch by Alexey Vyskubov, forwarded by Michael Stone.

	* tests/du/slink: New test for system.h change of 2002-08-31.

	In move mode, always first try to rename.  Before, upon failure to
	rename a directory, this code would never attempt to rename any
	other file in that directory, but would thenceforth always copy.
	On some systems (e.g., NetApp's OnTap-6.4), renaming a directory
	may fail with EXDEV, yet renaming files within that directory to
	a newly-created destination directory succeeds.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Remove local, move_mode;
	use x->move_mode instead.  Based on a patch from Tom Haynes.

2002-09-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	compiler warnings.

	Fix things so `mkdir -p' can create very deep directories, e.g.,
	mkdir -p $(perl -e 'print "a/" x 40000') now works.
	* src/mkdir.c (main): For --parents (-p), call make_path with the
	entire directory name, so we don't ever require that file operations
	like stat or chmod be performed on the entire command line argument.
	* makepath.c (make_path): Restore umask *before* creating the final
	component.

2002-09-27  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/tail.c (tail_bytes): Change type of bytes_remaining to off_t
	to avoid overflow.  Reported by Hans Lermen.

2002-09-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/install.c (get_ids): Use strtoul, not strtol.  Remove some casts.

2002-09-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/test.c (eaccess): Change type of local `euid' from int to uid_t
	and add a cast, to avoid a warning about `signed and unsigned type in
	conditional expression'.

2002-09-22  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/rmdir.c: Include "dirname.h", for declaration of
	strip_trailing_slashes.

	* src/stat.c (PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX): Remove definitions.
	Now they're defined through system.h.

	* src/cp-hash.c, src/dd.c, src/df.c, src/du.c, src/ls.c,
	* src/stat.c, src/wc.c: Remove all inclusions of inttypes.h,
	since it's already included from sys2.h via system.h.

	* Use automake-1.6f.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/Makefile.am (PERL): Remove duplicate definition.

	fmt's -s, -t, -c options didn't work properly for long lines.
	Since get_line may end up calling put_paragraph (for long lines),
	be sure to set global, `other_indent', before it is used there.

	* src/fmt.c (set_other_indent): New function, factored out of...
	(get_paragraph): ... here.  Call it.
	(get_line): Call set_other_indent before calling flush_paragraph,
	which calls fmt_paragraph, which in turn calls put_paragraph,
	which uses other_indent.

	* tests/fmt/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add long-line.
	* tests/fmt/long-line: New file/test, for the above fix.

2002-09-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/od.c: No longer include deprecated <values.h>.
	It was required solely for now-removed reference to BITSPERBYTE.
	* src/install.c: Likewise.
	Suggestion from Bruno Haible.

2002-09-06  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

2002-09-18  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	`od -t x8' used the wrong (`l'-prefixed) printf format.
	Likewise for the o8 and u8 formats.
	* src/od.c (ISPEC_TO_FORMAT): Define macro.
	(decode_one_format): Use PRIdMAX, PRIoMAX, etc. for LONG_LONG.
	Reported by Arun Sharma.

2002-09-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/sys2.h (PRIdMAX, PRIoMAX, PRIuMAX, PRIxMAX): Define if necessary.
	From gettext's intl/loadmsgcat.c.

	* tests/od/x8: New file/test, for the above fix.
	* tests/od/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add x8.

2002-09-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Use autoconf-2.54.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* src/csplit.c (get_format_width): Add cast to avoid
	warning about `signed and unsigned type in conditional expression'.

2002-09-14  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/who.c (print_user): Change type of local to size_t
	to avoid warnings about `comparison between signed and unsigned'.
	* src/ptx.c (generate_all_output): Likewise.

	* src/dd.c (main, skip): Add casts to avoid warnings about
	`comparison between signed and unsigned'.

	* src/id.c (print_full_info, print_group_list): Add casts to avoid
	warnings about `signed and unsigned type in conditional expression'.

	* src/md5sum.c: Change type of global, digest_hex_bytes, to size_t
	to avoid warnings about `comparison between signed and unsigned'.
	(split_3): Change parameter names to be readable and add comment.
	Clean up the test for whether a line may be ignored.

2002-09-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/printf.c (main): Handle leading command line argument of `--'.
	Reported by Raul: DervishD <raul@pleyades.net>
	* tests/misc/printf: New file: test for the above.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add printf.

	* src/date.c (usage): Explain that %S's range of [0..60] is required --
	rather than 0..59 -- to accommodate the occasional positive leap second.
	Reported by Richard Neill.

2002-09-12  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (nanosec_libs): Define.
	(sleep_LDADD, tail_LDADD): Use it here.

	Factor nanosleep-related code into ../lib/xnanosleep.c.
	* src/sleep.c: Include xnanosleep.h.
	Factor out fenv.h-related code.
	(timespec_subtract): Remove function.
	(main): Remove code that deals with computing start and stop times
	as well as the loop around nanosleep.  Now that's in xnanosleep.c.

	Allow S (in --sleep-interval=S) to be a floating point value.
	* src/tail.c: Include xnanosleep.h and xstrtod.h.
	Move declaration of global variable, sleep_interval, to ...
	(main): ...here.
	(usage): Update description of --sleep-interval option.
	(tail_forever): New parameter, sleep_interval.  Update caller.
	Use xnanosleep, rather than sleep.
	(parse_options): New parameter, sleep_interval.  Update caller.
	Use xstrtod, now that we accept floating point values.
	Prompted by a patch from Augey Mikus.

2002-09-06  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (prompt): Change comment to give a better note to
	translators.  From Michael Piefel.

2002-09-02  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* README: A good problem report/patch includes diffs against
	the most recent test release.

	* src/pathchk.c (NEED_PATHCONF_WRAPPER): Define.
	(pathconf_wrapper): Define only if NEED_PATHCONF_WRAPPER is set.

	* src/kill.c (print_table_row): Use an unsigned type for widths
	to avoid warning about comparison between signed and unsigned.
	(list_signals): Likewise.

	* src/od.c (skip): Add a cast to avoid warning about comparison
	between signed and unsigned.
	* src/install.c (get_ids): Likewise.  Also rearrange range-checking

2002-09-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Version 4.5.1.

2002-08-31  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Symlinks were always reported as using 0 blocks.
	* src/system.h (ST_NBLOCKS): Don't depend on file type.
	This reverts the change of 2000-01-30.
	Based on a report and patch from Neil Brown via Michael Stone.
	This fixes Debian Bug#156358.

	* Most files: Change `exit (0)' to `exit (EXIT_SUCCESS)',
	`exit (1)' to `exit (EXIT_FAILURE)', and
	`usage (1)' to `usage (EXIT_FAILURE)'.

	* chgrp.c, chmod.c, chown.c, chroot.c, cp.c, date.c, dd.c, du.c,
	* hostname.c, id.c, install.c, ln.c, mkdir.c, mkfifo.c, mknod.c,

	* su.c, tac-pipe.c, tail.c, tee.c, touch.c, uname.c, uptime.c,
	* users.c, who.c: Change `error (1, ...' to `error (EXIT_FAILURE, ...'.
	But don't change `error (0, ...' to `error (EXIT_SUCCESS, ...', since
	error never exits successfully.

2002-08-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Use closedir (not CLOSEDIR)
	when ignoring any return value.

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Detect and diagnose readdir
	failures.  On some systems (at least EMC Celerra and Solaris5.8),
	this appears to be necessary.
	(is_empty_dir): Likewise.  Also, always close directory handle.
	* src/ls.c (print_dir): Likewise.
	(print_dir): Rename local variable: reading -> dirp.
	Reported by Mike Coleman.

2002-08-28  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Use CLOSEDIR, not closedir.
	Give a diagnostic and fail if closedir fails.

2002-08-26  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (THANKS-to-translators): New rule.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add both THANKS-to-translators and THANKStt.in.
	* THANKStt.in: New file.

	* src/cat.c (close_stdout_wrapper): New, kludgey, function and
	file-scoped global.
	(main): Register it with atexit.
	Close STDOUT_FILENO, to avoid a problem when writing to
	/dev/audio on at least Solaris 5.7 and 5.8 systems.
	Reported by Shing-Shong Shei.

2002-08-25  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/cat.c (main): Close STDIN_FILENO rather than a literal `0'.
	* src/tac.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tee.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tr.c (main): Likewise.

2002-08-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/mv/setup: Rewrite not to use `: ${VAR=not_set}' paradigm.

2002-08-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/nohup.sh: Don't use "exec --"; it's not portable and
	shouldn't be needed.

2002-08-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/pr.c (main): Don't ignore -COLUMN if it's the last option.
	(usage): Clarify help text for the -COLUMN option.
	Patch by Padraig Brady.
	* tests/pr/Test.pm [col-last]: New test for the above.

	* configure.ac: Start with version 4.5.1, chosen so that it's larger
	than the latest version numbers of the component packages.

	* man/Makefile.am (check-x-vs-1): Set and export PATH so we use
	programs in ../src.

2002-08-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/date.c: Guard inclusion of <langinfo.h> with
	`#if HAVE_LANGINFO_CODESET', not `#if HAVE_LANGINFO_H'.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	Patch by GOTO Masanori.

2002-08-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some minor time-related bugs with POSIX time arguments.
	Some valid time stamps were being rejected (notably -1, and
	time stamps before 1900 on 64-bit hosts).  And some invalid
	time stamps were being accepted, e.g. September 31.

	* src/date.c (main): Adjust to posixtime signature change.
	* src/touch.c (main): Likewise.  Remove unnecessary initialization.
	Use localtime, not posixtm, to warn about obsolete "touch".

2002-08-05  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add nice and pathchk1.

2002-08-04  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add old/Makefile and old/*/Makefile.

2002-08-03  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add old.
	* old/: New directory, containing legacy ChangeLog* and NEWS files
	from the fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT): Set to false.

2002-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: uniq now obeys LC_COLLATE.

	* src/uniq.c: Include hard-locale.h, xmemcoll.h.
	(hard_LC_COLLATE): New var.
	(different): Args are now char *, not const char *.
	Use xmemcoll instead of memcmp to compare lines, so that
	LC_COLLATE has effect.  However, use memcmp if it is an
	easy locale.
	(check_file): Do not include newline in comparison, so that
	xmemcoll has a byte to stomp on temporarily.
	(main): Set hard_LC_COLLATE.

2002-07-29  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove djgpp, for now.

2002-07-20  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* Makefile.am (false.c): Convert only the final EXIT_SUCCESS
	into EXIT_FAILURE.  Otherwise, false --help and false --version
	would fail.

2002-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* src/Makefile.am (uninstall-local): Search for @GNU_PACKAGE@,
	rather than the hard-coded `sh-utils'.

2002-07-01  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* configure.ac: Merge the three files from fileutils,
	textutils, and sh-utils.
	* Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* src/Makefile.am: Likewise.
