# In a git/autoconf/automake-enabled project with a NEWS file and a version-
# controlled .prev-version file, automate the procedure by which we record
# the date, release-type and version string in the NEWS file.  That commit
# will serve to identify the release, so apply a signed tag to it as well.

Usage: $ME [OPTION...] VERSION RELEASE_TYPE

Run this script to perform the final pre-release NEWS update
in which the date, release-type and version string are recorded.
Commit that result with a log entry marking the release, and apply
a signed tag.  Run it from your project's top-level directory.

Requirements:
- you use git for version-control
- a NEWS file, with line 3 identical to this:
* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]
- a version-controlled .prev-version file

Options:
  --branch BRANCH            set release branch (default: master)
  --help                     print this help, then exit
  --version                  print version number, then exit

EXAMPLE:
To update NEWS and tag the beta 8.1 release of coreutils, I would run this:

  $ME 8.1 beta

Report bugs and patches to <bug-gnulib@gnu.org>.
