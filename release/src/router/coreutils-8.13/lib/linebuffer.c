/* Read an arbitrarily long line of text from STREAM into LINEBUFFER.
   Consider lines to be terminated by DELIMITER.
   Keep the delimiter; append DELIMITER if it's the last line of a file
   that ends in a character other than DELIMITER.  Do not NUL-terminate.
   Therefore the stream can contain NUL bytes, and the length
   (including the delimiter) is returned in linebuffer->length.
   Return NULL when stream is empty.  Return NULL and set errno upon
   error; callers can distinguish this case from the empty case by
   invoking ferror (stream).
