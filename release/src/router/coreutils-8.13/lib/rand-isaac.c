/*
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * We need a source of random numbers for some data.
 * Cryptographically secure is desirable, but it's not life-or-death
 * so I can be a little bit experimental in the choice of RNGs here.
 *
 * This generator is based somewhat on RC4, but has analysis
 * <http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html>
 * pointing to it actually being better.  I like it because it's nice
 * and fast, and because the author did good work analyzing it.
