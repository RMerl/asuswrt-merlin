   On most systems, putting it into BSS is sufficient.  Not so on MacOS X 10.3,
   see <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2009-01/msg00329.html>.
   When it needs an initializer, use 0 or {0} as initializer? 0 only works
   when mbstate_t is a scalar type (such as when gnulib defines it, or on
   AIX, IRIX, mingw). {0} works as an initializer in all cases: for a struct
   or union type, but also for a scalar type (ISO C 99, 6.7.8.(11)).  */
