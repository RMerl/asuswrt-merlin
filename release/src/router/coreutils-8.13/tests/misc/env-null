# POSIX is clear that environ may, but need not be, sorted.
# Environment variable values may contain newlines, which cannot be
# observed by merely inspecting output from env.
# Cygwin requires a minimal environment to launch new processes: execve
# adds missing variables SYSTEMROOT and WINDIR, which show up in a
# subsequent env.  Cygwin also requires /bin to always be part of PATH,
# and attempts to unset or reduce PATH may cause execve to fail.
#
# For these reasons, it is better to compare two outputs from distinct
# programs that should be the same, rather than building an exp file.
