# Up to coreutils-6.9, "printf %.Nf 0" would encounter an ENOMEM internal
# error from glibc's printf(3) function whenever N was large relative to
# the size of available memory.  As of Oct 2007, that internal stream-
# related failure was not reflected (for any libc I know of) in the usual
# stream error indicator that is tested by ferror.  The result was that
# while the printf command obviously failed (generated no output),
# it mistakenly exited successfully (exit status of 0).

# Testing it is tricky, because there is so much variance
# in quality for this corner of printf(3) implementations.
# Most implementations do attempt to allocate N bytes of storage.
# Using the maximum value for N (2^31-1) causes glibc-2.7 to try to
# allocate almost 2^64 bytes, while freeBSD 6.1's implementation
# correctly outputs almost 2GB worth of 0's, which takes too long.
# We want to test implementations that allocate N bytes, but without
# triggering the above extremes.

# Some other versions of glibc-2.7 have a snprintf function that segfaults
# when an internal (technically unnecessary!) memory allocation fails.

# The compromise is to limit virtual memory to something reasonable,
# and to make an N-byte-allocating-printf require more than that, thus
# triggering the printf(3) misbehavior -- which, btw, is required by ISO C99.
