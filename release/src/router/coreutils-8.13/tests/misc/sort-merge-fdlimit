# 'sort -m' should work in a limited file descriptor

# In coreutils 8.7 and earlier, 'sort' would dump core on this test.
#
# This test uses 'exec' to redirect file descriptors rather than
# ordinary redirection on the 'sort' command.  This is intended to
# work around bugs in OpenBSD /bin/sh, and some other sh variants,
# that squirrel away file descriptors before closing them; see
# <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2010-10/msg00075.html>.
# This test finds the bug only with shells that do not close FDs on
# exec, and will miss the bug (if present) on other shells, but it's
# not easy to fix this without running afoul of the OpenBSD-like sh bugs.
