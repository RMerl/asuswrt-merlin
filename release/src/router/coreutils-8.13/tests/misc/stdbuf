# Ensure un buffering stdin takes effect
#  The following works for me, but is racy. I.E. we're depending
#  on dd to run and close the fifo before the second write by uniq.
#  If we add a sleep, then we're just testing -oL
    # printf '3\n' > exp
    # dd count=1 if=fifo > /dev/null 2> err &
    # printf '1\n\2\n3\n' | (stdbuf -i0 -oL uniq > fifo; cat) > out
    # wait # for dd to complete
    # compare out exp || fail=1
#  One could remove the need for dd (used to close the fifo to get uniq to quit
#  early), if head -n1 read stdin char by char. Note uniq | head -c2 doesn't
#  suffice due to the buffering implicit in the pipe.  sed currently does read
#  stdin char by char, so we can test with `sed 1q`.  However I'm wary about
#  adding this dependency on a program outside of coreutils.
    # printf '2\n' > exp
    # printf '1\n2\n' | (stdbuf -i0 sed 1q >/dev/null; cat) > out
    # compare out exp || fail=1

# Ensure block buffering stdout takes effect
