# Before the fix, mv would unnecessarily unlink the destination symlink:
#   $ rm -rf s[12]; ln -s / s1; ln -s /tmp s2
#   $ strace -qe unlink /bin/mv -T s1 s2
#   unlink("s2") = 0
#
# With the fix, it doesn't call unlink:
#   $ rm -rf s[12]; ln -s / s1; ln -s /tmp s2
#   $ strace -qe unlink ./mv -T s1 s2
#   $

ln -s t1 s1 || framework_failure_
ln -s t2 s2 || framework_failure_

# Ensure that the source, s1, is gone.
ls -dl s1 > /dev/null 2>&1 && fail=1

# Ensure that the destination, s2, contains the link from s1.
