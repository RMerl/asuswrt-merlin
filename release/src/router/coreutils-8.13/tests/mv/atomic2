# Before the fix, mv would unnecessarily unlink the destination symlink:
#   $ rm -f a b b2; touch a b; ln b b2; strace -e unlink /p/bin/mv a b
#   unlink("b")                             = 0
#
# With the fix, it doesn't call unlink:
#   $ rm -f a b b2; touch a b; ln b b2; strace -e unlink ./mv a b
#   $
