# Show that fts (hence du, chmod, chgrp, chown) fails when all of the
# following are true:
#   - `.' is not readable
#   - operating on a hierarchy containing a relative name longer than PATH_MAX
#   - run on a system where gnulib's openat emulation must resort to using
#       save_cwd and restore_cwd (which fail if `.' is not readable).
# Thus, the following du invocation should succeed on newer Linux and
# Solaris systems, yet it must fail on systems lacking both openat and
# /proc support.  However, before coreutils-6.0 this test would fail even
# on Linux+PROC_FS systems because its fts implementation would revert
# unnecessarily to using FTS_NOCHDIR mode in this corner case.
