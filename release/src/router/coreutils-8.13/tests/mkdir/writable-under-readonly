# Test for the 2005-10-13 patch to lib/mkdir-p.c that fixed this sort
# of bug in mkdir:
#
#   "mkdir -p /a/b/c" no longer fails merely because a leading prefix
#   directory (e.g., /a or /a/b) exists on a read-only file system.
#
# Demonstrate the problem, as root:

. "${srcdir=.}/init.sh"; path_prepend_ ../src
print_ver_ mkdir
require_root_
require_mkfs_PATH_

# FIXME: for now, skip it unconditionally
skip_ temporarily disabled

# FIXME: define cleanup_ to do the umount

# FIXME: use mktemp
