# Using rm -rf to remove a 400k-entry directory takes:

# - 350 seconds without the patch, on a high-end system (disk 20-30% faster)

# Choose a value that is large enough to ensure an accidentally
# regressed rm would require much longer than $threshold_seconds to remove
# the directory.  With n=400k, pre-patch GNU rm would require about 350
# seconds even on a fast disk.  On a relatively modern system, the
# patched version of rm requires about 10 seconds, so even if you
# choose to enable very expensive tests with a disk that is much slower,
# the test should still succeed.
