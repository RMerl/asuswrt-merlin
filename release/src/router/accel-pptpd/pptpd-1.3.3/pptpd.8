.TH PPTPD 8 "29 December 2005"
.SH NAME
pptpd - PPTP VPN daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B pptpd
[ 
.IR options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pptpd
is the Poptop PPTP daemon, which manages tunnelled PPP connections
encapsulated in GRE using the PPTP VPN protocol.  It may contain
features like IP address management and TCP wrappers if compiled in.
.SH OPTIONS

Here we document the command line options.  See 
.BR pptpd.conf (5)
for configuration directives, IP address allocation, routing, and
firewall rules.

.TP
\fB-b\fR|\fB--bcrelay \fIinternal-interface
specifies that broadcasts received on the server's internal 
network interface should be relayed to the clients.

.TP
\fB-c\fR|\fB--conf \fIconf-file
specifies the configuration file for
.B pptpd
(default
.IR /etc/pptpd.conf )

.TP
.BR -d | --debug
turns on debugging mode, causing more debugging messages to be sent
to syslog.

.TP
\fB-e\fR|\fB--ppp \fIpppd-program
use
.I pppd-program
in place of the default
.BR pppd (8).

.TP
.BR -f | --fg
run in the foreground instead of detaching from terminal

.TP
.BR -h | --help
display program usage.

.TP
.BR -i | --noipparam
do not send the client's IP address to ip-up scripts (required if you are using the 
.BR pppd (8)
.I ipparam
option for some other purpose).

.TP
\fB-l\fR|\fB--listen \fIx.x.x.x
specifies the local interface IP address to listen on.

.TP
\fB-o\fR|\fB--option \fIppp-conf-file
specifies that pptpd should specify an alternate configuration file
for the ppp daemon (the default is normally
.I /etc/ppp/options
but may vary depending on your ppp daemon).

.TP
\fB-p\fR|\fB--pidfile \fIpid-file
specifies an alternate location to store the process ID file (default
.IR /var/run/pptpd.pid ).

.TP
\fB-s\fR|\fB--speed \fIbaud
specifies that the speed
.I baud
should be passed to the ppp daemon as the tty speed to use (in some
cases this is ignored by the ppp daemon).

.TP
\fB-t\fR|\fB--stimeout \fIseconds
specifies the number of seconds to wait for the first packet before
dropping the connection. This is a denial of service protection
feature.

.TP
\fB-T\fR|\fB--ptimeout \fImilliseconds
number of miliseconds to wait for a PPTP "ack" packet after transmitting
was stoped due to sliding window exceeded. The default is 1000 miliseconds.

.TP
\fB-k\fR|\fB--keep
Keep connections after pptpd daemon exit. Default do not keep connections,
all connections would be terminated on pptpd exit.

.TP
.BR -w | --logwtmp
update
.BR wtmp (5)
as users connect and disconnect.  See
.BR wtmp (1).

.TP
\fB-C\fR|\fB--connections \fIn
limits the number of client connections that may be accepted.  Corresponds to the
.BR connections
option in 
.IR pptpd.conf .
If pptpd is allocating IP addresses (e.g. 
.BR --delegate
is not used) then the number of connections is also limited by the
.BR remoteip
option in 
.IR pptpd.conf .

.TP
.BR -D | --delegate
delegates the allocation of client IP addresses to 
.BR pppd (8).
Without this option, which is the default, pptpd manages the list of
IP addresses for clients and passes the next free address to pppd.
With this option, pptpd does not pass an address, and so pppd may use
radius or chap-secrets to allocate an address.

.TP
.BR -v | --version
displays the current version of the pptp daemon.

.SH FILES
/etc/pptpd.conf
.br
/var/run/pptpd.pid

.SH DEBUGGING
To turn on debugging, add 'debug' to /etc/pptpd.conf and your
PPP options file, and restart pptpd.
.br
.LP
Typically the PPP options file is options.pptpd in /etc/ppp, though on
some distributions it may be pptpd-options.  Use your package manager
to find it, e.g. 'rpm -ql pptpd | grep options' or 'dpkg --listfiles
pptpd | grep options'.
.br
.LP
You may need to configure syslogd to catch debug messages.  e.g. edit
/etc/syslog.conf and add something similar to the example below, then
restart syslogd.
.br
.LP
# debug logging
.br
*.debug;mail.none                                       /var/log/debug
.br
.LP
This will log all debug information, except mail, to the file
/var/log/debug.  Note that this is a lot of information and might
flood your disks.  If performance is an issue, you can try turning off
sync during your debugging, by prefixing the destination with '-'.
.br
.LP
# debug logging
.br
*.debug;mail.none                                       -/var/log/debug
.br
.LP
Disable this line and restart syslog after you are done debugging.
See the syslog man pages for more details.
