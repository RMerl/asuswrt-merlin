Poptop README
-------------

You *must* do a 'make install' or Poptop will *NOT* find the binaries!
See INSTALL for generic compile/install instructions, and run
"./configure --help" for a list of valid options, or just type:

./configure
make
make install

(make install copies the binaries to /usr/local/sbin, so you better be root)

To run Poptop simply type: 'pptpd' (or /usr/local/sbin/pptpd if you don't
have /usr/local/sbin in your path).

You may specify a number of options on the command line to change
how Poptop launches PPP.

Type: 'pptpd -h' for options you may specify on the command line.

A sample config file is in samples/

Good Luck!
