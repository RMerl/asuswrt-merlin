	Reported by: Pawel Guraj.

Thu Apr 29 16:56:05 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	of strdup() and a blind cast instead of atoi().

	* pptpd.c: bug fix, --noipparam option on command line was causing

Fri Feb 27 09:50:41 2004  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* pptpctrl.c (launch_pppd): make sure SIGCHLD is unblocked. The
	procmask gets inherited from the manager and usually has the
	SIGCHLD blocked. Actually pppd does not expect that somebody
	tampered with its signal mask, thus we just unblock all signals
	and leave them to be handled by pppd.  This fixes the "ip-up
	zombie" bug.  From: Peter Stamfest <poptop@stamfest.at> 2003-09-06
