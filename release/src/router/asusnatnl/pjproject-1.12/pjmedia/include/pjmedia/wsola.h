 *
 * This section describes Waveform Similarity Based Overlap-Add (WSOLA)
 * implementation in PJMEDIA. The WSOLA API here can be used both to 
 * compress (speed-up) and stretch (expand, slow down) audio playback
 * without altering the pitch, or as a mean for performing packet loss
 * concealment (WSOLA).
 *
 * The WSOLA implementation is used by \ref PJMED_DELAYBUF and \ref PJMED_PLC.
