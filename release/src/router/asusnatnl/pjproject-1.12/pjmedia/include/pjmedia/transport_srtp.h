/**
 * @defgroup PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT_SRTP Secure RTP (SRTP) Media Transport
 * @ingroup PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT
 * @brief Media transport adapter to add SRTP feature to existing transports
 * @{
 *
 * This module implements SRTP as described by RFC 3711, using RFC 4568 as
 * key exchange method. It implements \ref PJMEDIA_TRANSPORT to integrate
 * with the rest of PJMEDIA framework.
 *
 * As we know, media transport is separated from the stream object (which 
 * does the encoding/decoding of PCM frames, (de)packetization of RTP/RTCP 
 * packets, and de-jitter buffering). The connection between stream and media
 * transport is established when the stream is created (we need to specify 
 * media transport during stream creation), and the interconnection can be 
 * depicted from the diagram below:
 *
   \image html media-transport.PNG

 * I think the diagram above is self-explanatory.
 *
 * SRTP functionality is implemented as some kind of "adapter", which is 
 * plugged between the stream and the actual media transport that does 
 * sending/receiving RTP/RTCP packets. When SRTP is used, the interconnection
 * between stream and transport is like the diagram below:
 *
    \image html media-srtp-transport.PNG

 * So to stream, the SRTP transport behaves as if it is a media transport 
 * (because it is a media transport), and to the media transport it behaves
 * as if it is a stream. The SRTP object then forwards RTP packets back and
 * forth between stream and the actual transport, encrypting/decrypting 
 * the RTP/RTCP packets as necessary.
 * 
 * The neat thing about this design is the SRTP "adapter" then can be used 
 * to encrypt any kind of media transports. We currently have UDP and ICE 
 * media transports that can benefit SRTP, and we could add SRTP to any 
 * media transports that will be added in the future.
