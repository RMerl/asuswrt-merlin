.SH "NAME"
tor \- The second\-generation onion router
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBtor\fR [\fIOPTION\fR \fIvalue\fR]\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Tor is a connection\-oriented anonymizing communication service\&. Users choose a source\-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others\&. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node\&.
.sp
Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of servers or relays ("onion routers")\&. Users bounce their TCP streams \(em web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc\&. \(em around the network, and recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream\&.
.sp
By default, \fBtor\fR will act as a client only\&. To help the network by providing bandwidth as a relay, change the \fBORPort\fR configuration option \(em see below\&. Please also consult the documentation on the Tor Project\(cqs website\&.
.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display a short help message and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
Specify a new configuration file to contain further Tor configuration options OR pass
\fB\-\fR
to make Tor read its configuration from standard input\&. (Default: @CONFDIR@/torrc, or $HOME/\&.torrc if that file is not found)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-allow\-missing\-torrc\fR
.RS 4
Do not require that configuration file specified by
\fB\-f\fR
exist if default torrc can be accessed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-defaults\-torrc\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
Specify a file in which to find default values for Tor options\&. The contents of this file are overridden by those in the regular configuration file, and by those on the command line\&. (Default: @CONFDIR@/torrc\-defaults\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ignore\-missing\-torrc\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that Tor should treat a missing torrc file as though it were empty\&. Ordinarily, Tor does this for missing default torrc files, but not for those specified on the command line\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Display Tor version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR|\fB\-\-hush\fR
.RS 4
Override the default console log\&. By default, Tor starts out logging messages at level "notice" and higher to the console\&. It stops doing so after it parses its configuration, if the configuration tells it to log anywhere else\&. You can override this behavior with the
\fB\-\-hush\fR
option, which tells Tor to only send warnings and errors to the console, or with the
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
option, which tells Tor not to log to the console at all\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keygen\fR [\fB\-\-newpass\fR]
.RS 4
Running "tor \-\-keygen" creates a new ed25519 master identity key for a relay, or only a fresh temporary signing key and certificate, if you already have a master key\&. Optionally you can encrypt the master identity key with a passphrase: Tor will ask you for one\&. If you don\(cqt want to encrypt the master key, just don\(cqt enter any passphrase when asked\&.


The
\fB\-\-newpass\fR
option should be used with \-\-keygen only when you need to add, change, or remove a passphrase on an existing ed25519 master identity key\&. You will be prompted for the old passphase (if any), and the new passphrase (if any)\&.


When generating a master key, you will probably want to use
\fB\-\-DataDirectory\fR
to control where the keys and certificates will be stored, and
\fB\-\-SigningKeyLifetime\fR
to control their lifetimes\&. Their behavior is as documented in the server options section below\&. (You must have write access to the specified DataDirectory\&.)


To use the generated files, you must copy them to the DataDirectory/keys directory of your Tor daemon, and make sure that they are owned by the user actually running the Tor daemon on your system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-passphrase\-fd\fR \fIFILEDES\fR
.RS 4
Filedescriptor to read the passphrase from\&. Note that unlike with the tor\-gencert program, the entire file contents are read and used as the passphrase, including any trailing newlines\&. Default: read from the terminal\&.
.RE
.sp
Other options can be specified on the command\-line in the format "\-\-option value", in the format "option value", or in a configuration file\&. For instance, you can tell Tor to start listening for SOCKS connections on port 9999 by passing \-\-SocksPort 9999 or SocksPort 9999 to it on the command line, or by putting "SocksPort 9999" in the configuration file\&. You will need to quote options with spaces in them: if you want Tor to log all debugging messages to debug\&.log, you will probably need to say \-\-Log \fIdebug file debug\&.log\fR\&.
.sp
Options on the command line override those in configuration files\&. See the next section for more information\&.
.SH "THE CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
.sp
All configuration options in a configuration are written on a single line by default\&. They take the form of an option name and a value, or an option name and a quoted value (option value or option "value")\&. Anything after a # character is treated as a comment\&. Options are case\-insensitive\&. C\-style escaped characters are allowed inside quoted values\&. To split one configuration entry into multiple lines, use a single backslash character (\e) before the end of the line\&. Comments can be used in such multiline entries, but they must start at the beginning of a line\&.
.sp
By default, an option on the command line overrides an option found in the configuration file, and an option in a configuration file overrides one in the defaults file\&.
.sp
This rule is simple for options that take a single value, but it can become complicated for options that are allowed to occur more than once: if you specify four SocksPorts in your configuration file, and one more SocksPort on the command line, the option on the command line will replace \fIall\fR of the SocksPorts in the configuration file\&. If this isn\(cqt what you want, prefix the option name with a plus sign (+), and it will be appended to the previous set of options instead\&. For example, setting SocksPort 9100 will use only port 9100, but setting +SocksPort 9100 will use ports 9100 and 9050 (because this is the default)\&.
.sp
Alternatively, you might want to remove every instance of an option in the configuration file, and not replace it at all: you might want to say on the command line that you want no SocksPorts at all\&. To do that, prefix the option name with a forward slash (/)\&. You can use the plus sign (+) and the forward slash (/) in the configuration file and on the command line\&.

\fBBandwidthRate\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKBytes\fR|\fBMBytes\fR|\fBGBytes\fR|\fBKBits\fR|\fBMBits\fR|\fBGBits\fR
.RS 4
A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value\&. If you want to run a relay in the public network, this needs to be
\fIat the very least\fR
75 KBytes for a relay (that is, 600 kbits) or 50 KBytes for a bridge (400 kbits) \(em but of course, more is better; we recommend at least 250 KBytes (2 mbits) if possible\&. (Default: 1 GByte)


With this option, and in other options that take arguments in bytes, KBytes, and so on, other formats are also supported\&. Notably, "KBytes" can also be written as "kilobytes" or "kb"; "MBytes" can be written as "megabytes" or "MB"; "kbits" can be written as "kilobits"; and so forth\&. Tor also accepts "byte" and "bit" in the singular\&. The prefixes "tera" and "T" are also recognized\&. If no units are given, we default to bytes\&. To avoid confusion, we recommend writing "bytes" or "bits" explicitly, since it\(cqs easy to forget that "B" means bytes, not bits\&.

If set, we will not advertise more than this amount of bandwidth for our BandwidthRate\&.

In its first form, when set along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client forwards its traffic to a SOCKS\-speaking proxy on "IP:PORT"\&. It\(cqs the duty of that proxy to properly forward the traffic to the bridge\&.


In its second form, when set along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client launches the pluggable transport proxy executable in

\fBConstrainedSockets\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
If set, Tor will tell the kernel to attempt to shrink the buffers for all sockets to the size specified in
\fBConstrainedSockSize\fR\&. This is useful for virtual servers and other environments where system level TCP buffers may be limited\&. If you\(cqre on a virtual server, and you encounter the "Error creating network socket: No buffer space available" message, you are likely experiencing this problem\&.


The preferred solution is to have the admin increase the buffer pool for the host itself via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem or equivalent facility; this configuration option is a second\-resort\&.


The DirPort option should also not be used if TCP buffers are scarce\&. The cached directory requests consume additional sockets which exacerbates the problem\&.


You should
\fBnot\fR
enable this feature unless you encounter the "no buffer space available" issue\&. Reducing the TCP buffers affects window size for the TCP stream and will reduce throughput in proportion to round trip time on long paths\&. (Default: 0)
.RE

When
\fBConstrainedSockets\fR

torspec)\&. Note: unless you also specify one or more of
\fBHashedControlPassword\fR
or
\fBCookieAuthentication\fR, setting this option will cause Tor to allow any process on the local host to control it\&. (Setting both authentication methods means either method is sufficient to authenticate to Tor\&.) This option is required for many Tor controllers; most use the value of 9051\&. If a unix domain socket is used, you may quote the path using standard C escape sequences\&. Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you\&. (Default: 0)

Use a nonstandard authoritative directory server at the provided address and port, with the specified key fingerprint\&. This option can be repeated many times, for multiple authoritative directory servers\&. Flags are separated by spaces, and determine what kind of an authority this directory is\&. By default, an authority is not authoritative for any directory style or version unless an appropriate flag is given\&. Tor will use this authority as a bridge authoritative directory if the "bridge" flag is set\&. If a flag "orport=\fBport\fR" is given, Tor will use the given port when opening encrypted tunnels to the dirserver\&. If a flag "weight=\fBnum\fR" is given, then the directory server is chosen randomly with probability proportional to that weight (default 1\&.0)\&. If a flag "v3ident=\fBfp\fR" is given, the dirserver is a v3 directory authority whose v3 long\-term signing key has the fingerprint
\fBfp\fR\&. Lastly, if an "ipv6=\fIaddress\fR:\fIorport\fR" flag is present, then the directory authority is listening for IPv6 connections on the indicated IPv6 address and OR Port\&.


Tor will contact the authority at
\fIaddress\fR:\fIport\fR
(the DirPort) to download directory documents\&. If an IPv6 address is supplied, Tor will also download directory documents at the IPv6 address on the DirPort\&.


If no

These options override the default behavior of Tor\(cqs (\fBcurrently experimental\fR) path bias detection algorithm\&. To try to find broken or misbehaving guard nodes, Tor looks for nodes where more than a certain fraction of circuits through that guard fail to get built\&.

The PathBiasCircThreshold option controls how many circuits we need to build through a guard before we make these checks\&. The PathBiasNoticeRate, PathBiasWarnRate and PathBiasExtremeRate options control what fraction of circuits must succeed through a guard so we won\(cqt write log messages\&. If less than PathBiasExtremeRate circuits succeed
\fBand\fR
PathBiasDropGuards is set to 1, we disable use of that guard\&.


When we have seen more than PathBiasScaleThreshold circuits through a guard, we scale our observations by 0\&.5 (governed by the consensus) so that new observations don\(cqt get swamped by old ones\&.


By default, or if a negative value is provided for one of these options, Tor uses reasonable defaults from the networkstatus consensus document\&. If no defaults are available there, these options default to 150, \&.70, \&.50, \&.30, 0, and 300 respectively\&.

Similar to the above options, these options override the default behavior of Tor\(cqs (\fBcurrently experimental\fR) path use bias detection algorithm\&.

Where as the path bias parameters govern thresholds for successfully building circuits, these four path use bias parameters govern thresholds only for circuit usage\&. Circuits which receive no stream usage are not counted by this detection algorithm\&. A used circuit is considered successful if it is capable of carrying streams or otherwise receiving well\-formed responses to RELAY cells\&.

By default, or if a negative value is provided for one of these options, Tor uses reasonable defaults from the networkstatus consensus document\&. If no defaults are available there, these options default to 20, \&.80, \&.60, and 100, respectively\&.

\fBExitRelay\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR|\fBauto\fR

Tells Tor whether to run as an exit relay\&. If Tor is running as a non\-bridge server, and ExitRelay is set to 1, then Tor allows traffic to exit according to the ExitPolicy option (or the default ExitPolicy if none is specified)\&.

If ExitRelay is set to 0, no traffic is allowed to exit, and the ExitPolicy option is ignored\&.


If ExitRelay is set to "auto", then Tor behaves as if it were set to 1, but warns the user if this would cause traffic to exit\&. In a future version, the default value will be 0\&. (Default: auto)
.RE

\fBExitPolicy\fR \fIpolicy\fR,\fIpolicy\fR,\fI\&...\fR
.RS 4
Set an exit policy for this server\&. Each policy is of the form "\fBaccept[6]\fR|\fBreject[6]\fR
\fIADDR\fR[/\fIMASK\fR][:\fIPORT\fR]"\&. If /\fIMASK\fR
is omitted then this policy just applies to the host given\&. Instead of giving a host or network you can also use "*" to denote the universe (0\&.0\&.0\&.0/0 and ::/128), or *4 to denote all IPv4 addresses, and *6 to denote all IPv6 addresses\&.
\fIPORT\fR
can be a single port number, an interval of ports "\fIFROM_PORT\fR\-\fITO_PORT\fR", or "*"\&. If
\fIPORT\fR
is omitted, that means "*"\&.


For example, "accept 18\&.7\&.22\&.69:*,reject 18\&.0\&.0\&.0/8:*,accept *:*" would reject any IPv4 traffic destined for MIT except for web\&.mit\&.edu, and accept any other IPv4 or IPv6 traffic\&.


Tor also allows IPv6 exit policy entries\&. For instance, "reject6 [FC00::]/7:*" rejects all destinations that share 7 most significant bit prefix with address FC00::\&. Respectively, "accept6 [C000::]/3:*" accepts all destinations that share 3 most significant bit prefix with address C000::\&.


accept6 and reject6 only produce IPv6 exit policy entries\&. Using an IPv4 address with accept6 or reject6 is ignored and generates a warning\&. accept/reject allows either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses\&. Use *4 as an IPv4 wildcard address, and *6 as an IPv6 wildcard address\&. accept/reject * expands to matching IPv4 and IPv6 wildcard address rules\&.


To specify all IPv4 and IPv6 internal and link\-local networks (including 0\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 169\&.254\&.0\&.0/16, 127\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16, 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8, 172\&.16\&.0\&.0/12, [::]/8, [FC00::]/7, [FE80::]/10, [FEC0::]/10, [FF00::]/8, and [::]/127), you can use the "private" alias instead of an address\&. ("private" always produces rules for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, even when used with accept6/reject6\&.)


Private addresses are rejected by default (at the beginning of your exit policy), along with any configured primary public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&. These private addresses are rejected unless you set the ExitPolicyRejectPrivate config option to 0\&. For example, once you\(cqve done that, you could allow HTTP to 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 and block all other connections to internal networks with "accept 127\&.0\&.0\&.1:80,reject private:*", though that may also allow connections to your own computer that are addressed to its public (external) IP address\&. See RFC 1918 and RFC 3330 for more details about internal and reserved IP address space\&. See ExitPolicyRejectLocalInterfaces if you want to block every address on the relay, even those that aren\(cqt advertised in the descriptor\&.


This directive can be specified multiple times so you don\(cqt have to put it all on one line\&.


Policies are considered first to last, and the first match wins\&. If you want to allow the same ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your rules using accept/reject *\&. If you want to allow different ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your IPv6 rules using accept6/reject6 *6, and your IPv4 rules using accept/reject *4\&. If you want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end your exit policy with either a reject *:* or an accept *:*\&. Otherwise, you\(cqre _augmenting_ (prepending to) the default exit policy\&. The default exit policy is:
