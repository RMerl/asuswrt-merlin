Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly.

To build Tor from source:
        ./configure && make && make install

To build Tor from a just-cloned git repository:
        sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
