OpenBSD_malloc_Linux.c:

    The OpenBSD malloc implementation, ported to Linux.  Used only when
    --enable-openbsd-malloc is passed to the configure script.

strlcat.c
strlcpy.c

    Implementations of strlcat and strlcpy, the more sane replacements
    for strcat and strcpy.  These are nonstandard, and some libc
    implementations refuse to add them for religious reasons.

ht.h

    An implementation of a hash table in the style of Niels Provos's
    tree.h.  Shared with Libevent.

tinytest.[ch]
tinytest_demos.c
tinytest_macros.h

    A unit testing framework. https://github.com/nmathewson/tinytest

tor_queue.h

    A copy of sys/queue.h from OpenBSD.  We keep our own copy rather
    than using sys/queue.h, since some platforms don't have a
    sys/queue.h, and the ones that do have diverged in incompatible
    ways.  (CIRCLEQ or no CIRCLEQ? SIMPLQ or STAILQ?)  We also rename
    the identifiers with a TOR_ prefix to avoid conflicts with
    the system headers.

curve25519_donna/*.c

    A copy of Adam Langley's curve25519-donna mostly-portable
    implementations of curve25519.

csiphash.c
siphash.h

    Marek Majkowski's implementation of siphash 2-4, a secure keyed
    hash algorithm to avoid collision-based DoS attacks against hash
    tables.

trunnel/*.[ch]

    Headers and runtime code for Trunnel, a system for generating
    code to encode and decode binary formats.

ed25519/ref10/*

    Daniel Bernsten's portable ref10 implementation of ed25519.
    Public domain.

ed25519/donna/*

    Andrew Moon's semi-portable ed25519-donna implementation of
    ed25519. Public domain.

keccak-tiny/

    David Leon Gil's portable Keccak implementation. CC0.

readpassphrase.[ch]

    Portable readpassphrase implementation from OpenSSH portable, version
    6.8p1.

timeouts/

    William Ahern's hierarchical timer-wheel implementation. MIT license.

mulodi/

    Contains an overflow-checking 64-bit signed integer multiply
    from LLVM's compiler_rt.  For some reason, this is missing from
    32-bit libclang in many places. Dual licensed MIT-license and
    BSD-like license; see mulodi/LICENSE.TXT.
