What it is
==========

USB_ModeSwitch is - hardly surprising -  a mode switching tool for controlling
USB devices with multiple "modes". Now, what does THAT mean?

More and more USB devices have their MS Windows drivers onboard; when plugged
in for the first time they act like a flash storage and offer their driver
installation from there.
After installation (and on every consecutive plugging) the driver switches the
mode internally by sending a certain command sequence; the storage device
vanishes (in most cases) and a different device - like a USB modem - shows up.
To the host, this is like unplugging one device and then plugging annother.

At first this feature appeared on devices with cell phone chipsets, presumably
because some of them were already able to change the mode of their USB port
from storage to communication - so why not make use of this in a modem stick?
Modem maker "Option" calls that feature "ZeroCD (TM)" since it eliminates the
need for shipping a separate driver carrier.

In the beginning, nothing of this was documented in any form and there was
hardly any Linux/Unix support available.
On the good side, most of the known devices are working out of the box in all
modes with available Linux modules like "usb-storage" or serial USB drivers.
That leaves only the problem of the mode-switching from storage to whatever
the thing is supposed to do.

Fortunately there are things like human smartness, USB sniffing programs and
LibUSB. The obvious way is to eavesdrop on the communication of the MS Windows
driver, to isolate the command or action that does the switching, and then re-
play the same sequence in a non-Windows system.

In theory, this task could also be handled on the kernel driver level, but a
userspace program is much more flexible and can easily be disabled if access
to the initial mode of those devices should be desired. There has been a
principle decision by kernel developers to keep mode-switching outside of the
kernel.

So USB_ModeSwitch has evolved to make this process easy to handle by taking the
relevant parameters from configuration files and handling all initialization
and communication business, with essential help from "libusb".

In Linux and friends it is intended to work automatically - via udev events
and rules - and doing the mode switch without any user interaction.
However, the core C program should be as portable als libusb itself; it does not
rely on specific Linux features.
It can also be run as an interactive command line tool, particularly useful when
trying to tinker with hitherto unknown devices.

We have already collected a wide range of information on how to mode-switch all
sorts of devices. If you run into a new one that is unknown yet, don't despair:
we can find out what you need to do!


How to install
==============

If you only need the core C program, just run "make". All further steps de-
scribed below are referring to a common, fairly current Linux system where
USB_ModeSwitch is expected to do its work automatically.

!! You need the usb-modeswitch-data package from the same source as this !!

If you have an earlier version installed, de-installation is recommended ("make
uninstall") but not mandatory. The wrapper script location changed in 1.1.0;
old files might be orphaned but will not do any harm.

The main prerequisite for installing from source is the development package for
"libusb". It may be called "libusb-dev" or similar in your distribution. From
usb_modeswitch 2.0.0 on, it should have an "1.x" in the name to reflect the change
to libusb-1. There are also variants around called "libusbx" if libusb-1 is not
available on your distribution.

To install the tool set, unpack and run the install command (see below) in the
newly created directory.

From version 1.2.0, there are three flavours of installing. The only difference
between those is the way the dispatcher is installed, but this affects the
dependencies as well:

1. If you have the "Tcl" scripting language available on your system (packages
   "tcl" or "jimsh"), use the light-weight installation:

   # make install

2. If you are size-constrained and have the Jimsh library on your system
   (package "libjim-dev"), you can have the Tcl interpreter embedded with the
   dispatcher, using its shared lib:

   # make install-shared

3. If you are size-constrained and definitely don't need a Tcl interpreter
   for anything else, choose the statically embedded flavour. This will have
   no further dependency as it uses the included interpreter code, which is
   configured for small size:

   # make install-static

Note that the "static"/"shared" targets are NOT referring to the usb_modeswitch
program, only to the dispatcher!
Any one of these commands will install a small posix shell script, the
dispatcher (wrapper) as script or as binary, a global config file, the core
program and a man page.

Install the data package as well and you are set.

NOTE: installing over (possibly outdated) Linux distribution packages of this
program and the data collection should not be a problem.


How to use
==========

If your device is known, you should be able to just plug it and use it. If
it doesn't work - we will find out why.

For manual use just run "usb_modeswitch" (as root). Work with the command
line interface or with a setup file. You can use any file and give its path
with the "-c" parameter.
The file named "device_reference.txt" that you can find on the home site of
this package is a device and configuration reference containing most known
devices; you can use it as a "database" to create your own configuration file.
It's heavily commented and should tell you what to do. It also contains a
thorough explanation of all the parameters.

Run "usb_modeswitch -h" to list the command line parameters.
See also the provided man page.

Important note: Manual use is mainly intended for testing and analyzing!!
The program puts no limits on what you can send to your USB device, so I
assume it is possible to screw it up profoundly.

Once your new device is switching fine you can add it to the data files to
make the process automatic.

For this to work, add a rule entry to the rules file to let udev run
usb_modeswitch as soon as the default IDs are found (when the device is
plugged). If you look into the rules file you will see immediately how
your new entry should look like.
The location is:
/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules

Then add your new config file to the folder
"/etc/usb_modeswitch.d" (only for custom config files!).
And don't forget to report your success !!

Again, remember that the rules file and the default device config folder
(/usr/share/usb_modeswitch) are installed by the usb_modeswitch data package.


##########
Important: libusb programs - like this tool - want to be run with administrative
privileges (as root or with sudo)!

Contribute
==========

USB_ModeSwitch comes quite handy for experimenting with your own hardware if
not supported yet. You could try this approach:

Note the device's vendor and product ID from /proc/bus/usb/devices (or from the
output of lsusb); the assigned driver is usually "usb-storage". Then try spying
on the USB communication to the device with the same ID inside MS Windoze. I
recommend this tool:
"SniffUSB" (http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/index.php.en).

PLEASE post any improvements, new device information and/or bug reports to the
forum (see above) or send it to the author (see below)!
