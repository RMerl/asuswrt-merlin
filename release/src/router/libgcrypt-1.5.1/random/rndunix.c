 Hi,

 Sure.  I assumed that since GPG was GPLd, you'd prefer the GPL for the entropy
 code as well, but Ian asked for LGPL as an option so as of the next release
 I'll have LGPL in there.  You can consider it to be retroactive, so your
 current version will be LGPLd as well.

 Peter.

 Sure, it covers the entire entropy-gathering subsystem.

/* The structure containing information on random-data sources.  Each
 * record contains the source and a relative estimate of its usefulness
 * (weighting) which is used to scale the number of kB of output from the
 * source (total = data_bytes / usefulness).  Usually the weighting is in the
 * range 1-3 (or 0 for especially useless sources), resulting in a usefulness
 * rating of 1...3 for each kB of source output (or 0 for the useless
 * sources).
 *
 * If the source is constantly changing (certain types of network statistics
 * have this characteristic) but the amount of output is small, the weighting
 * is given as a negative value to indicate that the output should be treated
 * as if a minimum of 1K of output had been obtained.  If the source produces
 * a lot of output then the scale factor is fractional, resulting in a
 * usefulness rating of < 1 for each kB of source output.
 *
 * In order to provide enough randomness to satisfy the requirements for a
 * slow poll, we need to accumulate at least 20 points of usefulness (a
 * typical system should get about 30 points).
 *
 * Some potential options are missed out because of special considerations.
 * pstat -i and pstat -f can produce amazing amounts of output (the record
 * is 600K on an Oracle server) which floods the buffer and doesn't yield
 * anything useful (apart from perhaps increasing the entropy of the vmstat
 * output a bit), so we don't bother with this.  pstat in general produces
 * quite a bit of output, but it doesn't change much over time, so it gets
 * very low weightings.  netstat -s produces constantly-changing output but
 * also produces quite a bit of it, so it only gets a weighting of 2 rather
 * than 3.  The same holds for netstat -in, which gets 1 rather than 2.
 *
 * Some binaries are stored in different locations on different systems so
 * alternative paths are given for them.  The code sorts out which one to
 * run by itself, once it finds an exectable somewhere it moves on to the
 * next source.  The sources are arranged roughly in their order of
 * usefulness, occasionally sources which provide a tiny amount of
 * relatively useless data are placed ahead of ones which provide a large
 * amount of possibly useful data because another 100 bytes can't hurt, and
 * it means the buffer won't be swamped by one or two high-output sources.
 * All the high-output sources are clustered towards the end of the list
 * for this reason.  Some binaries are checked for in a certain order, for
 * example under Slowaris /usr/ucb/ps understands aux as an arg, but the
 * others don't.  Some systems have conditional defines enabling alternatives
 * to commands which don't understand the usual options but will provide
 * enough output (in the form of error messages) to look like they're the
 * real thing, causing alternative options to be skipped (we can't check the
 * return either because some commands return peculiar, non-zero status even
 * when they're working correctly).
 *
 * In order to maximise use of the buffer, the code performs a form of run-
 * length compression on its input where a repeated sequence of bytes is
 * replaced by the occurrence count mod 256.  Some commands output an awful
 * lot of whitespace, this measure greatly increases the amount of data we
 * can fit in the buffer.
 *
 * When we scale the weighting using the SC() macro, some preprocessors may
 * give a division by zero warning for the most obvious expression
 * 'weight ? 1024 / weight : 0' (and gcc 2.7.2.2 dies with a division by zero
 * trap), so we define a value SC_0 which evaluates to zero when fed to
 * '1024 / SC_0' */
