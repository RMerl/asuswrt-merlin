.SH "COMPONENTS"
.PP
The Samba suite is made up of several components. Each component is described in a separate manual page. It is strongly recommended that you read the documentation that comes with Samba and the manual pages of those components that you use. If the manual pages and documents aren't clear enough then please visit
http://devel.samba.org
for information on how to file a bug report or submit a patch.
.PP
If you require help, visit the Samba webpage at
http://www.samba.org/
and explore the many option available to you.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
The Samba software suite is licensed under the GNU Public License(GPL). A copy of that license should have come with the package in the file COPYING. You are encouraged to distribute copies of the Samba suite, but please obey the terms of this license.
.PP
The latest version of the Samba suite can be obtained via anonymous ftp from samba.org in the directory pub/samba/. It is also available on several mirror sites worldwide.
.PP
You may also find useful information about Samba on the newsgroup
comp.protocol.smb
and the Samba mailing list. Details on how to join the mailing list are given in the README file that comes with Samba.
.PP
If you have access to a WWW viewer (such as Mozilla or Konqueror) then you will also find lots of useful information, including back issues of the Samba mailing list, at
http://lists.samba.org.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3.0 of the Samba suite.
.SH "CONTRIBUTIONS"
.PP
If you wish to contribute to the Samba project, then I suggest you join the Samba mailing list at
http://lists.samba.org.
.PP
If you have patches to submit, visit
http://devel.samba.org/
for information on how to do it properly. We prefer patches in
diff -u
format.
.SH "CONTRIBUTORS"
.PP
Contributors to the project are now too numerous to mention here but all deserve the thanks of all Samba users. To see a full list, look at the
\fIchange-log\fR
in the source package for the pre-CVS changes and at
http://cvs.samba.org/
for the contributors to Samba post-CVS. CVS is the Open Source source code control system used by the Samba Team to develop Samba. The project would have been unmanageable without it.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
