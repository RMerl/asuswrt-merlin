.SH "NAME"
smb.conf - The configuration file for the Samba suite
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
The
\fIsmb.conf\fR
file is a configuration file for the Samba suite.
\fIsmb.conf\fR
contains runtime configuration information for the Samba programs. The
\fIsmb.conf\fR
file is designed to be configured and administered by the
\fBswat\fR(8)
program. The complete description of the file format and possible parameters held within are here for reference purposes.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins. Sections contain parameters of the form:

.sp

.nf

\fIname\fR = \fIvalue \fR

.fi

.PP
The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter.
.PP
Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.
.PP
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant. Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim.
.PP
Any line beginning with a semicolon (\fB;\fR) or a hash (\fB#\fR) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.
.PP
Any line ending in a
\fB\\\fR
is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion.
.PP
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 0/1 or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values. Some items such as create masks are numeric.
.SH "SECTION DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP
Each section in the configuration file (except for the [global] section) describes a shared resource (known as a
\fBshare\fR). The section name is the name of the shared resource and the parameters within the section define the shares attributes.
.PP
There are three special sections, [global], [homes] and [printers], which are described under
\fBspecial sections\fR. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions.
.PP
A share consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of the service. Some housekeeping options are also specifiable.
.PP
Sections are either file share services (used by the client as an extension of their native file systems) or printable services (used by the client to access print services on the host running the server).
.PP
Sections may be designated
\fBguest\fR
services, in which case no password is required to access them. A specified UNIX
\fBguest account\fR
is used to define access privileges in this case.
.PP
Sections other than guest services will require a password to access them. The client provides the username. As older clients only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list of usernames to check against the password using the
user =
option in the share definition. For modern clients such as Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary.
.PP
The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host system. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants.
.PP
The following sample section defines a file space share. The user has write access to the path
\fI/home/bar\fR. The share is accessed via the share name
foo:

.sp

.nf

	\fI[foo]\fR
	path = /home/bar
	read only = no

.fi

.PP
The following sample section defines a printable share. The share is read-only, but printable. That is, the only write access permitted is via calls to open, write to and close a spool file. The
\fBguest ok\fR
parameter means access will be permitted as the default guest user (specified elsewhere):

.sp

.nf

	\fI[aprinter]\fR
	path = /usr/spool/public
	read only = yes
	printable = yes
	guest ok = yes

.fi

.SH "SPECIAL SECTIONS"
.SS "The [global] section"
.PP
Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole, or are defaults for sections that do not specifically define certain items. See the notes under PARAMETERS for more information.
.SS "The [homes] section"
.PP
If a section called [homes] is included in the configuration file, services connecting clients to their home directories can be created on the fly by the server.
.PP
When the connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no match is found, the requested section name is treated as a username and looked up in the local password file. If the name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is created by cloning the [homes] section.
.PP
Some modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.TP 3n
\(bu
The share name is changed from homes to the located username.
.TP 3n
\(bu
If no path was given, the path is set to the user's home directory.
.PP
If you decide to use a
\fBpath =\fR
line in your [homes] section, it may be useful to use the %S macro. For example:

.sp

.nf

\fBpath = /data/pchome/%S\fR

.fi
is useful if you have different home directories for your PCs than for UNIX access.
.PP
This is a fast and simple way to give a large number of clients access to their home directories with a minimum of fuss.
.PP
A similar process occurs if the requested section name is
\fBhomes\fR, except that the share name is not changed to that of the requesting user. This method of using the [homes] section works well if different users share a client PC.
.PP
The [homes] section can specify all the parameters a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense than others. The following is a typical and suitable [homes] section:

.sp

.nf

\fI[homes]\fR
read only = no

.fi

.PP
An important point is that if guest access is specified in the [homes] section, all home directories will be visible to all clients
\fBwithout a password\fR. In the very unlikely event that this is actually desirable, it is wise to also specify
\fBread only access\fR.
.PP
The
\fBbrowseable\fR
flag for auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable flag, not the [homes] browseable flag. This is useful as it means setting
\fBbrowseable = no\fR
in the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make any auto home directories visible.
.SS "The [printers] section"
.PP
This section works like [homes], but for printers.
.PP
If a [printers] section occurs in the configuration file, users are able to connect to any printer specified in the local host's printcap file.
.PP
When a connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is used. If no match is found, but a [homes] section exists, it is used as described above. Otherwise, the requested section name is treated as a printer name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see if the requested section name is a valid printer share name. If a match is found, a new printer share is created by cloning the [printers] section.
.PP
A few modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.TP 3n
\(bu
The share name is set to the located printer name
.TP 3n
\(bu
If no printer name was given, the printer name is set to the located printer name
.TP 3n
\(bu
If the share does not permit guest access and no username was given, the username is set to the located printer name.
.PP
The [printers] service MUST be printable - if you specify otherwise, the server will refuse to load the configuration file.
.PP
Typically the path specified is that of a world-writeable spool directory with the sticky bit set on it. A typical [printers] entry looks like this:

.sp

.nf

\fI[printers]\fR
path = /usr/spool/public
guest ok = yes
printable = yes

.fi

.PP
All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file are legitimate printer names as far as the server is concerned. If your printing subsystem doesn't work like that, you will have to set up a pseudo-printcap. This is a file consisting of one or more lines like this:

.sp

.nf

alias|alias|alias|alias...    

.fi

.PP
Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for your printing subsystem. In the [global] section, specify the new file as your printcap. The server will only recognize names found in your pseudo-printcap, which of course can contain whatever aliases you like. The same technique could be used simply to limit access to a subset of your local printers.
.PP
An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the first entry of a printcap record. Records are separated by newlines, components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical bar symbols (|).
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
\fBNote\fR
.PP
On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what printers are defined on the system you may be able to use
printcap name = lpstat
to automatically obtain a list of printers. See the
printcap name
option for more details.
.SH "USERSHARES"
.PP
Starting with Samba version 3.0.23 the capability for non-root users to add, modify, and delete their own share definitions has been added. This capability is called
\fBusershares\fR
and is controlled by a set of parameters in the [global] section of the smb.conf. The relevant parameters are :
.PP
usershare allow guests
.RS 3n
Controls if usershares can permit guest access.
.RE
.PP
usershare max shares
.RS 3n
Maximum number of user defined shares allowed.
.RE
.PP
usershare owner only
.RS 3n
If set only directories owned by the sharing user can be shared.
.RE
.PP
usershare path
.RS 3n
Points to the directory containing the user defined share definitions. The filesystem permissions on this directory control who can create user defined shares.
.RE
.PP
usershare prefix allow list
.RS 3n
Comma-separated list of absolute pathnames restricting what directories can be shared. Only directories below the pathnames in this list are permitted.
.RE
.PP
usershare prefix deny list
.RS 3n
Comma-separated list of absolute pathnames restricting what directories can be shared. Directories below the pathnames in this list are prohibited.
.RE
.PP
usershare template share
.RS 3n
Names a pre-existing share used as a template for creating new usershares. All other share parameters not specified in the user defined share definition are copied from this named share.
.RE
.PP
To allow members of the UNIX group
foo
to create user defined shares, create the directory to contain the share definitions as follows:
.PP
Become root:

.nf

mkdir /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chgrp foo /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chmod 1770 /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares

.fi
.PP
Then add the parameters

.sp

.nf

	usershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
	usershare max shares = 10 # (or the desired number of shares)

.fi
to the global section of your
\fIsmb.conf\fR. Members of the group foo may then manipulate the user defined shares using the following commands.
.PP
net usershare add sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]
.RS 3n
To create or modify (overwrite) a user defined share.
.RE
.PP
net usershare delete sharename
.RS 3n
To delete a user defined share.
.RE
.PP
net usershare list wildcard-sharename
.RS 3n
To list user defined shares.
.RE
.PP
net usershare info wildcard-sharename
.RS 3n
To print information about user defined shares.
.RE
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
Parameters define the specific attributes of sections.
.PP
Some parameters are specific to the [global] section (e.g.,
\fBsecurity\fR). Some parameters are usable in all sections (e.g.,
\fBcreate mask\fR). All others are permissible only in normal sections. For the purposes of the following descriptions the [homes] and [printers] sections will be considered normal. The letter
\fBG\fR
in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the [global] section. The letter
\fBS\fR
indicates that a parameter can be specified in a service specific section. All
\fBS\fR
parameters can also be specified in the [global] section - in which case they will define the default behavior for all services.
.PP
Parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order - this may not create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where there are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer to the preferred synonym.
.SH "VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS"
.PP
Many of the strings that are settable in the config file can take substitutions. For example the option
\fBpath = /tmp/%u\fR
is interpreted as
\fBpath = /tmp/john\fR
if the user connected with the username john.
.PP
These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, but there are some general substitutions which apply whenever they might be relevant. These are:
.PP
%U
.RS 3n
session username (the username that the client wanted, not necessarily the same as the one they got).
.RE
.PP
%G
.RS 3n
primary group name of %U.
.RE
.PP
%h
.RS 3n
the Internet hostname that Samba is running on.
.RE
.PP
%m
.RS 3n
the NetBIOS name of the client machine (very useful).
.sp
This parameter is not available when Samba listens on port 445, as clients no longer send this information. If you use this macro in an include statement on a domain that has a Samba domain controller be sure to set in the [global] section
\fIsmb ports = 139\fR. This will cause Samba to not listen on port 445 and will permit include functionality to function as it did with Samba 2.x.
.RE
.PP
%L
.RS 3n
the NetBIOS name of the server. This allows you to change your config based on what the client calls you. Your server can have a
\fBdual personality\fR.
.RE
.PP
%M
.RS 3n
the Internet name of the client machine.
.RE
.PP
%R
.RS 3n
the selected protocol level after protocol negotiation. It can be one of CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2 or NT1.
.RE
.PP
%d
.RS 3n
the process id of the current server process.
.RE
.PP
%a
.RS 3n
the architecture of the remote machine. It currently recognizes Samba (\fBSamba\fR), the Linux CIFS file system (\fBCIFSFS\fR), OS/2, (\fBOS2\fR), Windows for Workgroups (\fBWfWg\fR), Windows 9x/ME (\fBWin95\fR), Windows NT (\fBWinNT\fR), Windows 2000 (\fBWin2K\fR), Windows XP (\fBWinXP\fR), and Windows 2003 (\fBWin2K3\fR). Anything else will be known as
\fBUNKNOWN\fR.
.RE
.PP
%I
.RS 3n
the IP address of the client machine.
.RE
.PP
%i
.RS 3n
the local IP address to which a client connected.
.RE
.PP
%T
.RS 3n
the current date and time.
.RE
.PP
%D
.RS 3n
name of the domain or workgroup of the current user.
.RE
.PP
%w
.RS 3n
the winbind separator.
.RE
.PP
%$(\fIenvvar\fR)
.RS 3n
the value of the environment variable
\fIenvar\fR.
.RE
.PP
The following substitutes apply only to some configuration options (only those that are used when a connection has been established):
.PP
%S
.RS 3n
the name of the current service, if any.
.RE
.PP
%P
.RS 3n
the root directory of the current service, if any.
.RE
.PP
%u
.RS 3n
username of the current service, if any.
.RE
.PP
%g
.RS 3n
primary group name of %u.
.RE
.PP
%H
.RS 3n
the home directory of the user given by %u.
.RE
.PP
%N
.RS 3n
the name of your NIS home directory server. This is obtained from your NIS auto.map entry. If you have not compiled Samba with the
\fB--with-automount\fR
option, this value will be the same as %L.
.RE
.PP
%p
.RS 3n
the path of the service's home directory, obtained from your NIS auto.map entry. The NIS auto.map entry is split up as
%N:%p.
.RE
.PP
There are some quite creative things that can be done with these substitutions and other
\fIsmb.conf\fR
options.
.SH "NAME MANGLING"
.PP
Samba supports
name mangling
so that DOS and Windows clients can use files that don't conform to the 8.3 format. It can also be set to adjust the case of 8.3 format filenames.
.PP
There are several options that control the way mangling is performed, and they are grouped here rather than listed separately. For the defaults look at the output of the testparm program.
.PP
These options can be set separately for each service.
.PP
The options are:
.PP
case sensitive = yes/no/auto
.RS 3n
controls whether filenames are case sensitive. If they aren't, Samba must do a filename search and match on passed names. The default setting of auto allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS and smbclient 3.0.5 and above currently) to tell the Samba server on a per-packet basis that they wish to access the file system in a case-sensitive manner (to support UNIX case sensitive semantics). No Windows or DOS system supports case-sensitive filename so setting this option to auto is that same as setting it to no for them. Default
\fBauto\fR.
.RE
.PP
default case = upper/lower
.RS 3n
controls what the default case is for new filenames (ie. files that don't currently exist in the filesystem). Default
\fBlower\fR. IMPORTANT NOTE: This option will be used to modify the case of
\fBall\fR
incoming client filenames, not just new filenames if the options
case sensitive = yes,
preserve case = No,
short preserve case = No are set. This change is needed as part of the optimisations for directories containing large numbers of files.
.RE
.PP
preserve case = yes/no
.RS 3n
controls whether new files (ie. files that don't currently exist in the filesystem) are created with the case that the client passes, or if they are forced to be the
default
case. Default
\fByes\fR.
.RE
.PP
short preserve case = yes/no
.RS 3n
controls if new files (ie. files that don't currently exist in the filesystem) which conform to 8.3 syntax, that is all in upper case and of suitable length, are created upper case, or if they are forced to be the
default
case. This option can be used with
preserve case = yes
to permit long filenames to retain their case, while short names are lowercased. Default
\fByes\fR.
.RE
.PP
By default, Samba 3.0 has the same semantics as a Windows NT server, in that it is case insensitive but case preserving. As a special case for directories with large numbers of files, if the case options are set as follows, "case sensitive = yes", "case preserve = no", "short preserve case = no" then the "default case" option will be applied and will modify all filenames sent from the client when accessing this share.
.SH "NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION"
.PP
There are a number of ways in which a user can connect to a service. The server uses the following steps in determining if it will allow a connection to a specified service. If all the steps fail, the connection request is rejected. However, if one of the steps succeeds, the following steps are not checked.
.PP
If the service is marked
\fBguest only = yes\fR
and the server is running with share-level security (\fBsecurity = share\fR, steps 1 to 5 are skipped.
.TP 3n
1.
If the client has passed a username/password pair and that username/password pair is validated by the UNIX system's password programs, the connection is made as that username. This includes the
\\\\server\\service%\fIusername\fR
method of passing a username.
.TP 3n
2.
If the client has previously registered a username with the system and now supplies a correct password for that username, the connection is allowed.
.TP 3n
3.
The client's NetBIOS name and any previously used usernames are checked against the supplied password. If they match, the connection is allowed as the corresponding user.
.TP 3n
4.
If the client has previously validated a username/password pair with the server and the client has passed the validation token, that username is used.
.TP 3n
5.
If a
user =
field is given in the
\fIsmb.conf\fR
file for the service and the client has supplied a password, and that password matches (according to the UNIX system's password checking) with one of the usernames from the
user =
field, the connection is made as the username in the
user =
line. If one of the usernames in the
user =
list begins with a
@, that name expands to a list of names in the group of the same name.
.TP 3n
6.
If the service is a guest service, a connection is made as the username given in the
guest account =
for the service, irrespective of the supplied password.
.SH "EXPLANATION OF EACH PARAMETER"
.PP
abort shutdown script (G)
.RS 3n
This a full path name to a script called by
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
that should stop a shutdown procedure issued by the
shutdown script.
.sp

\fBSeRemoteShutdownPrivilege\fR, right, this command will be run as user.

Default:
\fB\fIabort shutdown script\fR = "" \fR
.sp
Example:
\fB\fIabort shutdown script\fR = /sbin/shutdown -c \fR
.RE
.PP
acl check permissions (S)
.RS 3n
This boolean parameter controls what
\fBsmbd\fR(8)does on receiving a protocol request of "open for delete" from a Windows client. If a Windows client doesn't have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time. POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory. As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file. With this parameter set to true (the default) then smbd checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it. This is not perfect, as it's possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly, but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour. Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case.
.sp
If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn't check permissions on "open for delete" and allows the open. If the user doesn't have permission to delete the file this will only be discovered at close time, which is too late for the Windows user tools to display an error message to the user. The symptom of this is files that appear to have been deleted "magically" re-appearing on a Windows explorer refersh. This is an extremely advanced protocol option which should not need to be changed. This parameter was introduced in its final form in 3.0.21, an earlier version with slightly different semantics was introduced in 3.0.20. That older version is not documented here.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIacl check permissions\fR = True \fR
.RE
.PP
acl compatibility (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter specifies what OS ACL semantics should be compatible with. Possible values are
\fBwinnt\fR
for Windows NT 4,
\fBwin2k\fR
for Windows 2000 and above and
\fBauto\fR. If you specify
\fBauto\fR, the value for this parameter will be based upon the version of the client. There should be no reason to change this parameter from the default.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIacl compatibility\fR = Auto \fR
.sp
Example:
\fB\fIacl compatibility\fR = win2k \fR
.RE
.PP
acl group control (S)
.RS 3n
In a POSIX filesystem, only the owner of a file or directory and the superuser can modify the permissions and ACLs on a file. If this parameter is set, then Samba overrides this restriction, and also allows the
\fBprimary group owner\fR
of a file or directory to modify the permissions and ACLs on that file.
.sp
On a Windows server, groups may be the owner of a file or directory - thus allowing anyone in that group to modify the permissions on it. This allows the delegation of security controls on a point in the filesystem to the group owner of a directory and anything below it also owned by that group. This means there are multiple people with permissions to modify ACLs on a file or directory, easing managability.
.sp
This parameter allows Samba to also permit delegation of the control over a point in the exported directory hierarchy in much the same was as Windows. This allows all members of a UNIX group to control the permissions on a file or directory they have group ownership on.
.sp
This parameter is best used with the
inherit owner option and also on on a share containing directories with the UNIX
\fBsetgid bit\fR
bit set on them, which causes new files and directories created within it to inherit the group ownership from the containing directory.
.sp
This is parameter has been marked deprecated in Samba 3.0.23. The same behavior is now implemented by the
\fIdos filemode\fR
option.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIacl group control\fR = no \fR
.RE
.PP
acl map full control (S)
.RS 3n
This boolean parameter controls whether
\fBsmbd\fR(8)maps a POSIX ACE entry of "rwx" (read/write/execute), the maximum allowed POSIX permission set, into a Windows ACL of "FULL CONTROL". If this parameter is set to true any POSIX ACE entry of "rwx" will be returned in a Windows ACL as "FULL CONTROL", is this parameter is set to false any POSIX ACE entry of "rwx" will be returned as the specific Windows ACL bits representing read, write and execute.

.RS 3n
This is the full pathname to a script that will be run

.sp
Normally, a Samba server requires that UNIX users are created for all users accessing files on this server. For sites that use Windows NT account databases as their primary user database creating these users and keeping the user list in sync with the Windows NT PDC is an onerous task. This option allows smbd to create the required UNIX users
\fBON DEMAND\fR
when a user accesses the Samba server.
.sp
In order to use this option,
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
must
\fBNOT\fR
be set to
security = share and
add user script must be set to a full pathname for a script that will create a UNIX user given one argument of
\fI%u\fR, which expands into the UNIX user name to create.
.sp
When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server, at login (session setup in the SMB protocol) time,
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
contacts the
password server and attempts to authenticate the given user with the given password. If the authentication succeeds then
smbd
attempts to find a UNIX user in the UNIX password database to map the Windows user into. If this lookup fails, and
add user script is set then
smbd
will call the specified script
\fBAS ROOT\fR, expanding any
\fI%u\fR
argument to be the user name to create.
.sp
If this script successfully creates the user then
smbd
will continue on as though the UNIX user already existed. In this way, UNIX users are dynamically created to match existing Windows NT accounts.

All UIDs and GIDs must be able to be resolved into SIDs for the correct operation of ACLs on the server.

.sp
This is useful if you only want your Samba server to serve resources to users in the domain it is a member of. As an example, suppose that there are two domains DOMA and DOMB. DOMB is trusted by DOMA, which contains the Samba server. Under normal circumstances, a user with an account in DOMB can then access the resources of a UNIX account with the same account name on the Samba server even if they do not have an account in DOMA.

bind interfaces only (G)
.RS 3n
This global parameter allows the Samba admin to limit what interfaces on a machine will serve SMB requests. It affects file service
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
and name service
\fBnmbd\fR(8)
in a slightly different ways.
.sp
For name service it causes
nmbd
to bind to ports 137 and 138 on the interfaces listed in the
interfaces parameter.
nmbd
also binds to the "all addresses" interface (0.0.0.0) on ports 137 and 138 for the purposes of reading broadcast messages. If this option is not set then
nmbd
will service name requests on all of these sockets. If
bind interfaces only is set then
nmbd
will check the source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast sockets and discard any that don't match the broadcast addresses of the interfaces in the
interfaces parameter list. As unicast packets are received on the other sockets it allows
nmbd
to refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive through any interfaces not listed in the
interfaces list. IP Source address spoofing does defeat this simple check, however, so it must not be used seriously as a security feature for
nmbd.
.sp
For file service it causes
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
to bind only to the interface list given in the
interfaces parameter. This restricts the networks that
smbd
will serve to packets coming in those interfaces. Note that you should not use this parameter for machines that are serving PPP or other intermittent or non-broadcast network interfaces as it will not cope with non-permanent interfaces.

bind interfaces only is set then unless the network address
\fB127.0.0.1\fR
is added to the

\fBsmbpasswd\fR(8)

.sp
To change a users SMB password, the
smbpasswd
by default connects to the
\fBlocalhost - 127.0.0.1\fR
address as an SMB client to issue the password change request. If
bind interfaces only is set then unless the network address
\fB127.0.0.1\fR
is added to the
interfaces parameter list then
smbpasswd
will fail to connect in it's default mode.
smbpasswd

\fI-r \fR\fI\fIremote machine\fR\fR
parameter, with
\fIremote machine\fR
set to the IP name of the primary interface of the local host.

The
swat
status page tries to connect with
smbd
and
nmbd
at the address
\fB127.0.0.1\fR
to determine if they are running. Not adding
\fB127.0.0.1\fR
will cause

default devmode (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter is only applicable to
printable services. When smbd is serving Printer Drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients, each printer on the Samba server has a Device Mode which defines things such as paper size and orientation and duplex settings. The device mode can only correctly be generated by the printer driver itself (which can only be executed on a Win32 platform). Because smbd is unable to execute the driver code to generate the device mode, the default behavior is to set this field to NULL.
.sp
Most problems with serving printer drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients can be traced to a problem with the generated device mode. Certain drivers will do things such as crashing the client's Explorer.exe with a NULL devmode. However, other printer drivers can cause the client's spooler service (spoolsv.exe) to die if the devmode was not created by the driver itself (i.e. smbd generates a default devmode).
.sp
This parameter should be used with care and tested with the printer driver in question. It is better to leave the device mode to NULL and let the Windows client set the correct values. Because drivers do not do this all the time, setting
default devmode = yes
will instruct smbd to generate a default one.

Windows allows specifying how a file will be shared with other processes when it is opened. Sharing violations occur when a file is opened by a different process using options that violate the share settings specified by other processes. This parameter causes smbd to act as a Windows server does, and defer returning a "sharing violation" error message for up to one second, allowing the client to close the file causing the violation in the meantime.

This option is used when Samba is attempting to delete a directory that contains one or more vetoed directories (see the

This is a new parameter introduced in Samba version 3.0.21. It specifies in seconds the time that smbd will cache the output of a disk free query. If set to zero (the default) no caching is done. This allows a heavily loaded server to prevent rapid spawning of
dfree command scripts increasing the load.

.sp
This setting allows the replacement of the internal routines to calculate the total disk space and amount available with an external routine. The example below gives a possible script that might fulfill this function.
.sp
In Samba version 3.0.21 this parameter has been changed to be a per-share parameter, and in addition the parameter
dfree cache time was added to allow the output of this script to be cached for systems under heavy load.
.sp
The external program will be passed a single parameter indicating a directory in the filesystem being queried. This will typically consist of the string
\fI./\fR. The script should return two integers in ASCII. The first should be the total disk space in blocks, and the second should be the number of available blocks. An optional third return value can give the block size in bytes. The default blocksize is 1024 bytes.

Note: Your script should
\fBNOT\fR
be setuid or setgid and should be owned by (and writeable only by) root!

This parameter is the octal modes which are used when converting DOS modes to UNIX modes when creating UNIX directories.
.sp
When a directory is created, the necessary permissions are calculated according to the mapping from DOS modes to UNIX permissions, and the resulting UNIX mode is then bit-wise 'AND'ed with this parameter. This parameter may be thought of as a bit-wise MASK for the UNIX modes of a directory. Any bit
\fBnot\fR
set here will be removed from the modes set on a directory when it is created.

This parameter is applied as a mask (AND'ed with) to the changed permission bits, thus preventing any bits not in this mask from being modified. Make sure not to mix up this parameter with
force directory security mode, which works similar like this one but uses logical OR instead of AND. Essentially, zero bits in this mask may be treated as a set of bits the user is not allowed to change.
.sp
If not set explicitly this parameter is set to 0777 meaning a user is allowed to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a directory.
.sp
\fBNote\fR
that users who can access the Samba server through other means can easily bypass this restriction, so it is primarily useful for standalone "appliance" systems. Administrators of most normal systems will probably want to leave it as the default of

workgroup on broadcast-isolated subnets will give this
nmbd

\fBsmbd\fR(8)
for a complete copy of the browse list for the whole wide area network. Browser clients will then contact their local master browser, and will receive the domain-wide browse list, instead of just the list for their broadcast-isolated subnet.
.sp
Note that Windows NT Primary Domain Controllers expect to be able to claim this
workgroup specific special NetBIOS name that identifies them as domain master browsers for that
workgroup by default (i.e. there is no way to prevent a Windows NT PDC from attempting to do this). This means that if this parameter is set and

.sp
This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares. If oplocks are enabled on a share, Visual C++ uses two different time reading calls to check if a file has changed since it was last read. One of these calls uses a one-second granularity, the other uses a two second granularity. As the two second call rounds any odd second down, then if the file has a timestamp of an odd number of seconds then the two timestamps will not match and Visual C++ will keep reporting the file has changed. Setting this option causes the two timestamps to match, and Visual C++ is happy.

Note that Windows NT 4.0 SP3 and above and also Windows 98 will by default expect encrypted passwords unless a registry entry is changed. To use encrypted passwords in Samba see the chapter "User Database" in the Samba HOWTO Collection.
.sp
MS Windows clients that expect Microsoft encrypted passwords and that do not have plain text password support enabled will be able to connect only to a Samba server that has encrypted password support enabled and for which the user accounts have a valid encrypted password. Refer to the smbpasswd command man page for information regarding the creation of encrypted passwords for user accounts.
.sp
The use of plain text passwords is NOT advised as support for this feature is no longer maintained in Microsoft Windows products. If you want to use plain text passwords you must set this parameter to no.
.sp
In order for encrypted passwords to work correctly
\fBsmbd\fR(8)

\fBsmbpasswd\fR(5)
file (see the
\fBsmbpasswd\fR(8)
program for information on how to set up and maintain this file), or set the

enhanced browsing (G)
.RS 3n
This option enables a couple of enhancements to cross-subnet browse propagation that have been added in Samba but which are not standard in Microsoft implementations.
.sp
The first enhancement to browse propagation consists of a regular wildcard query to a Samba WINS server for all Domain Master Browsers, followed by a browse synchronization with each of the returned DMBs. The second enhancement consists of a regular randomised browse synchronization with all currently known DMBs.
.sp
You may wish to disable this option if you have a problem with empty workgroups not disappearing from browse lists. Due to the restrictions of the browse protocols these enhancements can cause a empty workgroup to stay around forever which can be annoying.
.sp
In general you should leave this option enabled as it makes cross-subnet browse propagation much more reliable.

\fB\fIenhanced browsing\fR = yes \fR

enumports command (G)
.RS 3n
The concept of a "port" is fairly foreign to UNIX hosts. Under Windows NT/2000 print servers, a port is associated with a port monitor and generally takes the form of a local port (i.e. LPT1:, COM1:, FILE:) or a remote port (i.e. LPD Port Monitor, etc...). By default, Samba has only one port defined--\fB"Samba Printer Port"\fR. Under Windows NT/2000, all printers must have a valid port name. If you wish to have a list of ports displayed (smbd
does not use a port name for anything) other than the default
\fB"Samba Printer Port"\fR, you can define
\fIenumports command\fR
to point to a program which should generate a list of ports, one per line, to standard output. This listing will then be used in response to the level 1 and 2 EnumPorts() RPC.

.RS 3n
This option defines a list of log names that Samba will report to the Microsoft EventViewer utility. The listed eventlogs will be associated with tdb file on disk in the

.sp
The administrator must use an external process to parse the normal Unix logs such as
\fI/var/log/messages\fR

.PP
fake directory create times (S)
.RS 3n
NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create time for all files and directories. This is not the same as the ctime - status change time - that Unix keeps, so Samba by default reports the earliest of the various times Unix does keep. Setting this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 1-1-1980 as the create time for directories.
.sp
This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares. Visual C++ generated makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object file, and a make rule to create the directory. Also, when NMAKE compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a directory. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier timestamp than the object files it contains.
.sp
However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or or deleted in the directory. NMAKE finds all object files in the object directory. The timestamp of the last one built is then compared to the timestamp of the object directory. If the directory's timestamp if newer, then all object files will be rebuilt. Enabling this option ensures directories always predate their contents and an NMAKE build will proceed as expected.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIfake directory create times\fR = no \fR
.RE
.PP
fake oplocks (S)
.RS 3n
Oplocks are the way that SMB clients get permission from a server to locally cache file operations. If a server grants an oplock (opportunistic lock) then the client is free to assume that it is the only one accessing the file and it will aggressively cache file data. With some oplock types the client may even cache file open/close operations. This can give enormous performance benefits.
.sp
When you set
fake oplocks = yes,
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
will always grant oplock requests no matter how many clients are using the file.
.sp
It is generally much better to use the real
oplocks support rather than this parameter.
.sp
If you enable this option on all read-only shares or shares that you know will only be accessed from one client at a time such as physically read-only media like CDROMs, you will see a big performance improvement on many operations. If you enable this option on shares where multiple clients may be accessing the files read-write at the same time you can get data corruption. Use this option carefully!
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIfake oplocks\fR = no \fR

follow symlinks (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter allows the Samba administrator to stop
\fBsmbd\fR(8)

prevents any file or directory that is a symbolic link from being followed (the user will get an error). This option is very useful to stop users from adding a symbolic link to
\fI/etc/passwd\fR
in their home directory for instance. However it will slow filename lookups down slightly.

This option is enabled (i.e.
smbd
will follow symbolic links) by default.

force create mode (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit permissions that will

be set on a file created by Samba. This is done by bitwise 'OR'ing these bits onto the mode bits of a file that is being created or having its permissions changed. The default for this parameter is (in octal) 000. The modes in this parameter are bitwise 'OR'ed onto the file mode after the mask set in the
\fIcreate mask\fR
parameter is applied.
.sp
The example below would force all created files to have read and execute permissions set for 'group' and 'other' as well as the read/write/execute bits set for the 'user'.

force directory security mode (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter controls what UNIX permission bits can be modified when a Windows NT client is manipulating the UNIX permission on a directory using the native NT security dialog box.
.sp
This parameter is applied as a mask (OR'ed with) to the changed permission bits, thus forcing any bits in this mask that the user may have modified to be on. Make sure not to mix up this parameter with
directory security mask, which works in a similar manner to this one, but uses a logical AND instead of an OR.
.sp
Essentially, this mask may be treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security on a directory, to will enable (1) any flags that are off (0) but which the mask has set to on (1).
.sp
If not set explicitly this parameter is 0000, which allows a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a directory without restrictions.

.RS 3n
This parameter is a synonym for force group.
.RE
.PP
force group (S)
.RS 3n
This specifies a UNIX group name that will be assigned as the default primary group for all users connecting to this service. This is useful for sharing files by ensuring that all access to files on service will use the named group for their permissions checking. Thus, by assigning permissions for this group to the files and directories within this service the Samba administrator can restrict or allow sharing of these files.
.sp
In Samba 2.0.5 and above this parameter has extended functionality in the following way. If the group name listed here has a '+' character prepended to it then the current user accessing the share only has the primary group default assigned to this group if they are already assigned as a member of that group. This allows an administrator to decide that only users who are already in a particular group will create files with group ownership set to that group. This gives a finer granularity of ownership assignment. For example, the setting
\fIforce group = +sys\fR
means that only users who are already in group sys will have their default primary group assigned to sys when accessing this Samba share. All other users will retain their ordinary primary group.
.sp
If the
force user parameter is also set the group specified in
\fIforce group\fR
will override the primary group set in
\fIforce user\fR.

force printername (S)
.RS 3n
When printing from Windows NT (or later), each printer in
\fIsmb.conf\fR
has two associated names which can be used by the client. The first is the sharename (or shortname) defined in smb.conf. This is the only printername available for use by Windows 9x clients. The second name associated with a printer can be seen when browsing to the "Printers" (or "Printers and Faxes") folder on the Samba server. This is referred to simply as the printername (not to be confused with the
\fIprinter name\fR
option).
.sp
When assigning a new driver to a printer on a remote Windows compatible print server such as Samba, the Windows client will rename the printer to match the driver name just uploaded. This can result in confusion for users when multiple printers are bound to the same driver. To prevent Samba from allowing the printer's printername to differ from the sharename defined in smb.conf, set
\fIforce printername = yes\fR.
.sp
Be aware that enabling this parameter may affect migrating printers from a Windows server to Samba since Windows has no way to force the sharename and printername to match.
.sp
It is recommended that this parameter's value not be changed once the printer is in use by clients as this could cause a user not be able to delete printer connections from their local Printers folder.
.sp
Default:

force security mode (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter controls what UNIX permission bits can be modified when a Windows NT client is manipulating the UNIX permission on a file using the native NT security dialog box.
.sp
This parameter is applied as a mask (OR'ed with) to the changed permission bits, thus forcing any bits in this mask that the user may have modified to be on. Make sure not to mix up this parameter with
security mask, which works similar like this one but uses logical AND instead of OR.
.sp
Essentially, one bits in this mask may be treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security on a file, the user has always set to be on.
.sp
If not set explicitly this parameter is set to 0, and allows a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a file, with no restrictions.

force unknown acl user (S)
.RS 3n
If this parameter is set, a Windows NT ACL that contains an unknown SID (security descriptor, or representation of a user or group id) as the owner or group owner of the file will be silently mapped into the current UNIX uid or gid of the currently connected user.
.sp
This is designed to allow Windows NT clients to copy files and folders containing ACLs that were created locally on the client machine and contain users local to that machine only (no domain users) to be copied to a Samba server (usually with XCOPY /O) and have the unknown userid and groupid of the file owner map to the current connected user. This can only be fixed correctly when winbindd allows arbitrary mapping from any Windows NT SID to a UNIX uid or gid.
.sp
Try using this parameter when XCOPY /O gives an ACCESS_DENIED error.

Default:
\fB\fIforce unknown acl user\fR = no \fR

force user (S)
.RS 3n
This specifies a UNIX user name that will be assigned as the default user for all users connecting to this service. This is useful for sharing files. You should also use it carefully as using it incorrectly can cause security problems.
.sp
This user name only gets used once a connection is established. Thus clients still need to connect as a valid user and supply a valid password. Once connected, all file operations will be performed as the "forced user", no matter what username the client connected as. This can be very useful.
.sp
In Samba 2.0.5 and above this parameter also causes the primary group of the forced user to be used as the primary group for all file activity. Prior to 2.0.5 the primary group was left as the primary group of the connecting user (this was a bug).

The idmap backend provides a plugin interface for Winbind to use varying backends to store SID/uid/gid mapping tables. This option is mutually exclusive with the newer and more flexible
idmap domains parameter. The main difference between the "idmap backend" and the "idmap domains" is that the former only allows on backend for all domains while the latter supports configuring backends on a per domain basis.
.sp
Examples of SID/uid/gid backends include tdb (\fBidmap_tdb\fR(8)), ldap (\fBidmap_ldap\fR(8)), rid (\fBidmap_rid\fR(8)), and ad (\fBidmap_tdb\fR(8)).

idmap config (G)
.RS 3n
The idmap config prefix provides a means of managing each domain defined by the
idmap domains option using Samba's parameteric option support. The idmap config prefix should be followed by the name of the domain, a colon, and a setting specific to the chosen backend. There are three options available for all domains:

.RS 3n
.PP
backend = backend_name
.RS 3n
Specifies the name of the idmap plugin to use as the SID/uid/gid backend for this domain.
.RE
.PP
default = [yes|no]
.RS 3n
The default domain/backend will be used for searching for users and groups not belonging to one of the explicitly listed domains (matched by comparing the account SID and the domain SID).
.RE
.PP
readonly = [yes|no]
.RS 3n
Mark the domain as readonly which means that no attempts to allocate a uid or gid (by the
idmap alloc backend) for any user or group in that domain will be attempted.

inherit acls (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter can be used to ensure that if default acls exist on parent directories, they are always honored when creating a new file or subdirectory in these parent directories. The default behavior is to use the unix mode specified when creating the directory. Enabling this option sets the unix mode to 0777, thus guaranteeing that default directory acls are propagated.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIinherit acls\fR = no \fR
.RE
.PP
inherit owner (S)
.RS 3n
The ownership of new files and directories is normally governed by effective uid of the connected user. This option allows the Samba administrator to specify that the ownership for new files and directories should be controlled by the ownership of the parent directory.
.sp
Common scenarios where this behavior is useful is in implementing drop-boxes where users can create and edit files but not delete them and to ensure that newly create files in a user's roaming profile directory are actually owner by the user.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIinherit owner\fR = no \fR
.RE
.PP
inherit permissions (S)
.RS 3n
The permissions on new files and directories are normally governed by
create mask,
directory mask,
force create mode and
force directory mode but the boolean inherit permissions parameter overrides this.
.sp
New directories inherit the mode of the parent directory, including bits such as setgid.
.sp
New files inherit their read/write bits from the parent directory. Their execute bits continue to be determined by
map archive,
map hidden and
map system as usual.
.sp
Note that the setuid bit is
\fBnever\fR
set via inheritance (the code explicitly prohibits this).
.sp
This can be particularly useful on large systems with many users, perhaps several thousand, to allow a single [homes] share to be used flexibly by each user.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIinherit permissions\fR = no \fR
.RE
.PP
interfaces (G)
.RS 3n
This option allows you to override the default network interfaces list that Samba will use for browsing, name registration and other NBT traffic. By default Samba will query the kernel for the list of all active interfaces and use any interfaces except 127.0.0.1 that are broadcast capable.
.sp
The option takes a list of interface strings. Each string can be in any of the following forms:
.RS 3n
.TP 3n
\(bu
a network interface name (such as eth0). This may include shell-like wildcards so eth* will match any interface starting with the substring "eth"
.TP 3n
\(bu
an IP address. In this case the netmask is determined from the list of interfaces obtained from the kernel
.TP 3n
\(bu
an IP/mask pair.
.TP 3n
\(bu
a broadcast/mask pair.
.RE
.IP "" 3n
The "mask" parameters can either be a bit length (such as 24 for a C class network) or a full netmask in dotted decimal form.
.sp
The "IP" parameters above can either be a full dotted decimal IP address or a hostname which will be looked up via the OS's normal hostname resolution mechanisms.
.sp
By default Samba enables all active interfaces that are broadcast capable except the loopback adaptor (IP address 127.0.0.1).
.sp
The example below configures three network interfaces corresponding to the eth0 device and IP addresses 192.168.2.10 and 192.168.3.10. The netmasks of the latter two interfaces would be set to 255.255.255.0.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIinterfaces\fR = \fR

invalid users (S)
.RS 3n
This is a list of users that should not be allowed to login to this service. This is really a
\fBparanoid\fR
check to absolutely ensure an improper setting does not breach your security.
.sp
A name starting with a '@' is interpreted as an NIS netgroup first (if your system supports NIS), and then as a UNIX group if the name was not found in the NIS netgroup database.
.sp
A name starting with '+' is interpreted only by looking in the UNIX group database via the NSS getgrnam() interface. A name starting with '&' is interpreted only by looking in the NIS netgroup database (this requires NIS to be working on your system). The characters '+' and '&' may be used at the start of the name in either order so the value
\fI+&group\fR
means check the UNIX group database, followed by the NIS netgroup database, and the value
\fI&+group\fR
means check the NIS netgroup database, followed by the UNIX group database (the same as the '@' prefix).
.sp
The current servicename is substituted for
\fI%S\fR. This is useful in the [homes] section.

.RS 3n
For UNIXes that support kernel based

Kernel oplocks support allows Samba
\fIoplocks \fR

.sp
The LANMAN encrypted response is easily broken, due to it's case-insensitive nature, and the choice of algorithm. Servers without Windows 95/98/ME or MS DOS clients are advised to disable this option.
.sp
Unlike the
encrypt passwords
option, this parameter cannot alter client behaviour, and the LANMAN response will still be sent over the network. See the
client lanman auth

.sp
If this option, and
ntlm auth

ldap replication sleep (G)

When Samba is asked to write to a read-only LDAP replica, we are redirected to talk to the read-write master server. This server then replicates our changes back to the 'local' server, however the replication might take some seconds, especially over slow links. Certain client activities, particularly domain joins, can become confused by the 'success' that does not immediately change the LDAP back-end's data.
.sp
This option simply causes Samba to wait a short time, to allow the LDAP server to catch up. If you have a particularly high-latency network, you may wish to time the LDAP replication with a network sniffer, and increase this value accordingly.

ldapsam:editposix (G)
.RS 3n
Editposix is an option that leverages ldapsam:trusted to make it simpler to manage a domain controller eliminating the need to set up custom scripts to add and manage the posix users and groups. This option will instead directly manipulate the ldap tree to create, remove and modify user and group entries. This option also requires a running winbindd as it is used to allocate new uids/gids on user/group creation. The allocation range must be therefore configured.
.sp
To use this option, a basic ldap tree must be provided and the ldap suffix parameters must be properly configured. On virgin servers the default users and groups (Administrator, Guest, Domain Users, Domain Admins, Domain Guests) can be precreated with the command
net sam provision. To run this command the ldap server must be running, Winindd must be running and the smb.conf ldap options must be properly configured. The typical ldap setup used with the
ldapsam:trusted = yes option is usually sufficient to use
ldapsam:editposix = yes as well.
.sp
An example configuration can be the following:

.sp

.nf

	encrypt passwords = true
	passdb backend = ldapsam

	ldapsam:trusted=yes
	ldapsam:editposix=yes

	ldap admin dn = cn=admin,dc=samba,dc=org

	idmap backend = ldap:"ldap://localhost"

	idmap uid = 5000-50000
	idmap gid = 5000-50000

This configuration assume the ldap server have been loaded with a base tree like described in the following ldif:

ldapsam:trusted (G)
.RS 3n
By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the Unix-style NSS subsystem to access user and group information. Due to the way Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group this inevitably leads to inefficiencies. One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he is member of. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP. UNIX has optimized functions to enumerate group membership. Sadly, other functions that are used to deal with user and group attributes lack such optimization.
.sp
To make Samba scale well in large environments, the
ldapsam:trusted = yes option assumes that the complete user and group database that is relevant to Samba is stored in LDAP with the standard posixAccount/posixGroup attributes. It further assumes that the Samba auxiliary object classes are stored together with the POSIX data in the same LDAP object. If these assumptions are met,
ldapsam:trusted = yes can be activated and Samba can bypass the NSS system to query user group memberships. Optimized LDAP queries can greatly speed up domain logon and administration tasks. Depending on the size of the LDAP database a factor of 100 or more for common queries is easily achieved.

level2 oplocks (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter controls whether Samba supports level2 (read-only) oplocks on a share.
.sp
Level2, or read-only oplocks allow Windows NT clients that have an oplock on a file to downgrade from a read-write oplock to a read-only oplock once a second client opens the file (instead of releasing all oplocks on a second open, as in traditional, exclusive oplocks). This allows all openers of the file that support level2 oplocks to cache the file for read-ahead only (ie. they may not cache writes or lock requests) and increases performance for many accesses of files that are not commonly written (such as application .EXE files).
.sp
Once one of the clients which have a read-only oplock writes to the file all clients are notified (no reply is needed or waited for) and told to break their oplocks to "none" and delete any read-ahead caches.

logon home (G)
.RS 3n
This parameter specifies the home directory location when a Win95/98 or NT Workstation logs into a Samba PDC. It allows you to do
.sp

C:\>\fBNET USE H: /HOME\fR
.sp
from a command prompt, for example.
.sp
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine.
.sp
This parameter can be used with Win9X workstations to ensure that roaming profiles are stored in a subdirectory of the user's home directory. This is done in the following way:
.sp

logon home = \\\\%N\\%U\\profile
.sp
This tells Samba to return the above string, with substitutions made when a client requests the info, generally in a NetUserGetInfo request. Win9X clients truncate the info to \\server\share when a user does
net use /home
but use the whole string when dealing with profiles.
.sp
Note that in prior versions of Samba, the
logon path was returned rather than
\fIlogon home\fR. This broke
net use /home
but allowed profiles outside the home directory. The current implementation is correct, and can be used for profiles if you use the above trick.

Disable this feature by setting
logon home = "" - using the empty string.

logon path (G)
.RS 3n
This parameter specifies the directory where roaming profiles (Desktop, NTuser.dat, etc) are stored. Contrary to previous versions of these manual pages, it has nothing to do with Win 9X roaming profiles. To find out how to handle roaming profiles for Win 9X system, see the
logon home parameter.

This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or machine. It also specifies the directory from which the "Application Data",
\fIdesktop\fR,
\fIstart menu\fR,
\fInetwork neighborhood\fR,
\fIprograms\fR
and other folders, and their contents, are loaded and displayed on your Windows NT client.
.sp
The share and the path must be readable by the user for the preferences and directories to be loaded onto the Windows NT client. The share must be writeable when the user logs in for the first time, in order that the Windows NT client can create the NTuser.dat and other directories. Thereafter, the directories and any of the contents can, if required, be made read-only. It is not advisable that the NTuser.dat file be made read-only - rename it to NTuser.man to achieve the desired effect (a
\fBMAN\fRdatory profile).
.sp
Windows clients can sometimes maintain a connection to the [homes] share, even though there is no user logged in. Therefore, it is vital that the logon path does not include a reference to the homes share (i.e. setting this parameter to \\%N\homes\profile_path will cause problems).

\fBWarning\fR
Do not quote the value. Setting this as
\fB\\%N\profile\%U\fR
will break profile handling. Where the tdbsam or ldapsam passdb backend is used, at the time the user account is created the value configured for this parameter is written to the passdb backend and that value will over-ride the parameter value present in the smb.conf file. Any error present in the passdb backend account record must be editted using the appropriate tool (pdbedit on the command-line, or any other locally provided system tool).
Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up as a domain controller.
.sp
Disable the use of roaming profiles by setting the value of this parameter to the empty string. For example,
logon path = "". Take note that even if the default setting in the smb.conf file is the empty string, any value specified in the user account settings in the passdb backend will over-ride the effect of setting this parameter to null. Disabling of all roaming profile use requires that the user account settings must also be blank.

logon script (G)
.RS 3n
This parameter specifies the batch file (\fI.bat\fR) or NT command file (\fI.cmd\fR) to be downloaded and run on a machine when a user successfully logs in. The file must contain the DOS style CR/LF line endings. Using a DOS-style editor to create the file is recommended.
.sp
The script must be a relative path to the
\fI[netlogon]\fR
service. If the [netlogon] service specifies a
path of
\fI/usr/local/samba/netlogon\fR, and
logon script = STARTUP.BAT, then the file that will be downloaded is:

.sp

.nf

	/usr/local/samba/netlogon/STARTUP.BAT

.fi

.sp
The contents of the batch file are entirely your choice. A suggested command would be to add
NET TIME \\\\SERVER /SET /YES, to force every machine to synchronize clocks with the same time server. Another use would be to add
NET USE U: \\\\SERVER\\UTILS
for commonly used utilities, or

.sp

.nf

\fBNET USE Q: \\SERVER\ISO9001_QA\fR

.fi
for example.
.sp
Note that it is particularly important not to allow write access to the [netlogon] share, or to grant users write permission on the batch files in a secure environment, as this would allow the batch files to be arbitrarily modified and security to be breached.

lppause command (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter specifies the command to be executed on the server host in order to stop printing or spooling a specific print job.

This command should be a program or script which takes a printer name and job number to pause the print job. One way of implementing this is by using job priorities, where jobs having a too low priority won't be sent to the printer.

.sp
Some clients (notably Windows for Workgroups) may not correctly send the connection number for the printer they are requesting status information about. To get around this, the server reports on the first printer service connected to by the client. This only happens if the connection number sent is invalid.

This option allows you to put an upper limit on the apparent size of disks. If you set this option to 100 then all shares will appear to be not larger than 100 MB in size.
.sp
Note that this option does not limit the amount of data you can put on the disk. In the above case you could still store much more than 100 MB on the disk, but if a client ever asks for the amount of free disk space or the total disk size then the result will be bounded by the amount specified in
\fImax disk size\fR.

If you don't have a message command then the message won't be delivered and Samba will tell the sender there was an error. Unfortunately WfWg totally ignores the error code and carries on regardless, saying that the message was delivered.

This option is used by the programs in the Samba suite to determine what naming services to use and in what order to resolve host names to IP addresses. Its main purpose to is to control how netbios name resolution is performed. The option takes a space separated string of name resolution options.
.sp
The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause names to be resolved as follows:
.RS 3n
.TP 3n

nis homedir (G)
.RS 3n
Get the home share server from a NIS map. For UNIX systems that use an automounter, the user's home directory will often be mounted on a workstation on demand from a remote server.
.sp
When the Samba logon server is not the actual home directory server, but is mounting the home directories via NFS then two network hops would be required to access the users home directory if the logon server told the client to use itself as the SMB server for home directories (one over SMB and one over NFS). This can be very slow.
.sp
This option allows Samba to return the home share as being on a different server to the logon server and as long as a Samba daemon is running on the home directory server, it will be mounted on the Samba client directly from the directory server. When Samba is returning the home share to the client, it will consult the NIS map specified in
homedir map and return the server listed there.

Note that this also means Samba won't try to deduce usernames from the service name. This can be annoying for the [homes] section. To get around this you could use

This parameter controls whether Samba substitutes %-macros in the passdb fields if they are explicitly set. We used to expand macros here, but this turned out to be a bug because the Windows client can expand a variable %G_osver% in which %G would have been substituted by the user's primary group.

passwd chat (G)
.RS 3n
This string controls the
\fB"chat"\fR
conversation that takes places between
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
and the local password changing program to change the user's password. The string describes a sequence of response-receive pairs that
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
uses to determine what to send to the
passwd program and what to expect back. If the expected output is not received then the password is not changed.
.sp
This chat sequence is often quite site specific, depending on what local methods are used for password control (such as NIS etc).
.sp
Note that this parameter only is only used if the
unix password sync parameter is set to
\fByes\fR. This sequence is then called
\fBAS ROOT\fR
when the SMB password in the smbpasswd file is being changed, without access to the old password cleartext. This means that root must be able to reset the user's password without knowing the text of the previous password. In the presence of NIS/YP, this means that the
passwd program must be executed on the NIS master.
.sp
The string can contain the macro
\fI%n\fR
which is substituted for the new password. The chat sequence can also contain the standard macros \n, \r, \t and \s to give line-feed, carriage-return, tab and space. The chat sequence string can also contain a '*' which matches any sequence of characters. Double quotes can be used to collect strings with spaces in them into a single string.
.sp
If the send string in any part of the chat sequence is a full stop ".", then no string is sent. Similarly, if the expect string is a full stop then no string is expected.
.sp
If the
pam password change parameter is set to
\fByes\fR, the chat pairs may be matched in any order, and success is determined by the PAM result, not any particular output. The \n macro is ignored for PAM conversions.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIpasswd chat\fR = *new*password* %n\\n*new*password* %n\\n *changed* \fR

passwd program (G)
.RS 3n
The name of a program that can be used to set UNIX user passwords. Any occurrences of
\fI%u\fR
will be replaced with the user name. The user name is checked for existence before calling the password changing program.
.sp
Also note that many passwd programs insist in
\fBreasonable \fR
passwords, such as a minimum length, or the inclusion of mixed case chars and digits. This can pose a problem as some clients (such as Windows for Workgroups) uppercase the password before sending it.
.sp
\fBNote\fR
that if the
\fIunix password sync\fR
parameter is set to
\fByes \fR
then this program is called
\fBAS ROOT\fR
before the SMB password in the smbpasswd file is changed. If this UNIX password change fails, then
smbd
will fail to change the SMB password also (this is by design).

password level (G)
.RS 3n
Some client/server combinations have difficulty with mixed-case passwords. One offending client is Windows for Workgroups, which for some reason forces passwords to upper case when using the LANMAN1 protocol, but leaves them alone when using COREPLUS! Another problem child is the Windows 95/98 family of operating systems. These clients upper case clear text passwords even when NT LM 0.12 selected by the protocol negotiation request/response.
.sp
This parameter defines the maximum number of characters that may be upper case in passwords.
.sp
For example, say the password given was "FRED". If
\fI password level\fR
is set to 1, the following combinations would be tried if "FRED" failed:
.sp
"Fred", "fred", "fRed", "frEd","freD"
.sp
If
\fIpassword level\fR
was set to 2, the following combinations would also be tried:
.sp
"FRed", "FrEd", "FreD", "fREd", "fReD", "frED", ..
.sp
And so on.
.sp
The higher value this parameter is set to the more likely it is that a mixed case password will be matched against a single case password. However, you should be aware that use of this parameter reduces security and increases the time taken to process a new connection.
.sp
A value of zero will cause only two attempts to be made - the password as is and the password in all-lower case.
.sp
This parameter is used only when using plain-text passwords. It is not at all used when encrypted passwords as in use (that is the default since samba-3.0.0). Use this only when
encrypt passwords = No.

password server (G)
.RS 3n
By specifying the name of another SMB server or Active Directory domain controller with this option, and using
security = [ads|domain|server]
it is possible to get Samba to to do all its username/password validation using a specific remote server.
.sp
This option sets the name or IP address of the password server to use. New syntax has been added to support defining the port to use when connecting to the server the case of an ADS realm. To define a port other than the default LDAP port of 389, add the port number using a colon after the name or IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.100:389). If you do not specify a port, Samba will use the standard LDAP port of tcp/389. Note that port numbers have no effect on password servers for Windows NT 4.0 domains or netbios connections.
.sp
If parameter is a name, it is looked up using the parameter
name resolve order and so may resolved by any method and order described in that parameter.

The password server must be a machine capable of using the "LM1.2X002" or the "NT LM 0.12" protocol, and it must be in user level security mode.

\fBNote\fR
Using a password server means your UNIX box (running Samba) is only as secure as your password server.
\fBDO NOT CHOOSE A PASSWORD SERVER THAT YOU DON'T COMPLETELY TRUST\fR.
Never point a Samba server at itself for password serving. This will cause a loop and could lock up your Samba server!
.sp
The name of the password server takes the standard substitutions, but probably the only useful one is
\fI%m \fR, which means the Samba server will use the incoming client as the password server. If you use this then you better trust your clients, and you had better restrict them with hosts allow!
.sp
If the
\fIsecurity\fR
parameter is set to
\fBdomain\fR
or
\fBads\fR, then the list of machines in this option must be a list of Primary or Backup Domain controllers for the Domain or the character '*', as the Samba server is effectively in that domain, and will use cryptographically authenticated RPC calls to authenticate the user logging on. The advantage of using
security = domain
is that if you list several hosts in the
\fIpassword server\fR
option then
smbd
will try each in turn till it finds one that responds. This is useful in case your primary server goes down.
.sp
If the
\fIpassword server\fR
option is set to the character '*', then Samba will attempt to auto-locate the Primary or Backup Domain controllers to authenticate against by doing a query for the name
\fBWORKGROUP<1C>\fR
and then contacting each server returned in the list of IP addresses from the name resolution source.
.sp
If the list of servers contains both names/IP's and the '*' character, the list is treated as a list of preferred domain controllers, but an auto lookup of all remaining DC's will be added to the list as well. Samba will not attempt to optimize this list by locating the closest DC.
.sp
If the
\fIsecurity\fR
parameter is set to
\fBserver\fR, then there are different restrictions that
security = domain
doesn't suffer from:
.RS 3n

\(bu
You may list several password servers in the
\fIpassword server\fR
parameter, however if an
smbd
makes a connection to a password server, and then the password server fails, no more users will be able to be authenticated from this
smbd. This is a restriction of the SMB/CIFS protocol when in
security = server
mode and cannot be fixed in Samba.
.TP 3n
\(bu
If you are using a Windows NT server as your password server then you will have to ensure that your users are able to login from the Samba server, as when in

Use this option with caution, because if there are several hosts (whether Samba servers, Windows 95 or NT) that are preferred master browsers on the same subnet, they will each periodically and continuously attempt to become the local master browser.

.sp
To use the CUPS printing interface set
printcap name = cups. This should be supplemented by an addtional setting
printing = cups in the [global] section.
printcap name = cups

On System V systems that use
lpstat

printcap name = lpstat
to automatically obtain lists of available printers. This is the default for systems that define SYSV at configure time in Samba (this includes most System V based systems). If

print command (S)
.RS 3n
After a print job has finished spooling to a service, this command will be used via a
system()
call to process the spool file. Typically the command specified will submit the spool file to the host's printing subsystem, but there is no requirement that this be the case. The server will not remove the spool file, so whatever command you specify should remove the spool file when it has been processed, otherwise you will need to manually remove old spool files.
.sp
The print command is simply a text string. It will be used verbatim after macro substitutions have been made:
.sp
%s, %f - the path to the spool file name
.sp
%p - the appropriate printer name
.sp
%J - the job name as transmitted by the client.
.sp
%c - The number of printed pages of the spooled job (if known).
.sp
%z - the size of the spooled print job (in bytes)
.sp
The print command
\fBMUST\fR
contain at least one occurrence of
\fI%s\fR
or
\fI%f \fR
- the
\fI%p\fR
is optional. At the time a job is submitted, if no printer name is supplied the
\fI%p \fR
will be silently removed from the printer command.
.sp
If specified in the [global] section, the print command given will be used for any printable service that does not have its own print command specified.
.sp
If there is neither a specified print command for a printable service nor a global print command, spool files will be created but not processed and (most importantly) not removed.
.sp
Note that printing may fail on some UNIXes from the
\fBnobody\fR
account. If this happens then create an alternative guest account that can print and set the
guest account in the [global] section.
.sp
You can form quite complex print commands by realizing that they are just passed to a shell. For example the following will log a print job, print the file, then remove it. Note that ';' is the usual separator for command in shell scripts.
.sp
print command = echo Printing %s >> /tmp/print.log; lpr -P %p %s; rm %s
.sp
You may have to vary this command considerably depending on how you normally print files on your system. The default for the parameter varies depending on the setting of the
printing parameter.

Default: For
printing = BSD, AIX, QNX, LPRNG or PLP :

print command = lp -c -d%p %s; rm %s
.sp
For
printing = SOFTQ :
.sp
print command = lp -d%p -s %s; rm %s
.sp
For printing = CUPS : If SAMBA is compiled against libcups, then
printcap = cups uses the CUPS API to submit jobs, etc. Otherwise it maps to the System V commands with the -oraw option for printing, i.e. it uses
lp -c -d%p -oraw; rm %s. With

profile acls (S)

This boolean parameter was added to fix the problems that people have been having with storing user profiles on Samba shares from Windows 2000 or Windows XP clients. New versions of Windows 2000 or Windows XP service packs do security ACL checking on the owner and ability to write of the profile directory stored on a local workstation when copied from a Samba share.
.sp
When not in domain mode with winbindd then the security info copied onto the local workstation has no meaning to the logged in user (SID) on that workstation so the profile storing fails. Adding this parameter onto a share used for profile storage changes two things about the returned Windows ACL. Firstly it changes the owner and group owner of all reported files and directories to be BUILTIN\\Administrators, BUILTIN\\Users respectively (SIDs S-1-5-32-544, S-1-5-32-545). Secondly it adds an ACE entry of "Full Control" to the SID BUILTIN\\Users to every returned ACL. This will allow any Windows 2000 or XP workstation user to access the profile.
.sp
Note that if you have multiple users logging on to a workstation then in order to prevent them from being able to access each others profiles you must remove the "Bypass traverse checking" advanced user right. This will prevent access to other users profile directories as the top level profile directory (named after the user) is created by the workstation profile code and has an ACL restricting entry to the directory tree to the owning user.

.sp
This is useful if you want your Samba server to appear in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse propagation rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you can send IP packets to.
.sp
For example:

.sp

the above line would cause
nmbd

.sp
This is useful if you want your Samba server and all local clients to appear in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse propagation rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you can send IP packets to.
.sp
For example:

.sp

.nf

\fIremote browse sync = 192.168.2.255 192.168.4.255\fR

.fi
the above line would cause
nmbd
to request the master browser on the specified subnets or addresses to synchronize their browse lists with the local server.

The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast addresses of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses of known browse masters if your network config is that stable. If a machine IP address is given Samba makes NO attempt to validate that the remote machine is available, is listening, nor that it is in fact the browse master on its segment.

When a user with admin authority or SeAddUserPrivilege rights renames a user (e.g.: from the NT4 User Manager for Domains), this script will be run to rename the POSIX user. Two variables,

The script has all responsibility to rename all the necessary data that is accessible in this posix method. This can mean different requirements for different backends. The tdbsam and smbpasswd backends will take care of the contents of their respective files, so the script is responsible only for changing the POSIX username, and other data that may required for your circumstances, such as home directory. Please also consider whether or not you need to rename the actual home directories themselves. The ldapsam backend will not make any changes, because of the potential issues with renaming the LDAP naming attribute. In this case the script is responsible for changing the attribute that samba uses (uid) for locating users, as well as any data that needs to change for other applications using the same directory.

This boolean option controls whether an incoming session setup should kill other connections coming from the same IP. This matches the default Windows 2003 behaviour. Setting this parameter to yes becomes necessary when you have a flaky network and windows decides to reconnect while the old connection still has files with share modes open. These files become inaccessible over the new connection. The client sends a zero VC on the new connection, and Windows 2003 kills all other connections coming from the same IP. This way the locked files are accessible again. Please be aware that enabling this option will kill connections behind a masquerading router.

The server will

security (G)
.RS 3n
This option affects how clients respond to Samba and is one of the most important settings in the
\fI smb.conf\fR
file.
.sp
The option sets the "security mode bit" in replies to protocol negotiations with
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
to turn share level security on or off. Clients decide based on this bit whether (and how) to transfer user and password information to the server.
.sp
The default is
security = user, as this is the most common setting needed when talking to Windows 98 and Windows NT.
.sp
The alternatives are
security = share,
security = server
or
security = domain.
.sp
In versions of Samba prior to 2.0.0, the default was
security = share
mainly because that was the only option at one stage.
.sp
There is a bug in WfWg that has relevance to this setting. When in user or server level security a WfWg client will totally ignore the username and password you type in the "connect drive" dialog box. This makes it very difficult (if not impossible) to connect to a Samba service as anyone except the user that you are logged into WfWg as.
.sp
If your PCs use usernames that are the same as their usernames on the UNIX machine then you will want to use
security = user. If you mostly use usernames that don't exist on the UNIX box then use
security = share.
.sp
You should also use
security = share
if you want to mainly setup shares without a password (guest shares). This is commonly used for a shared printer server. It is more difficult to setup guest shares with
security = user, see the
map to guestparameter for details.
.sp
It is possible to use
smbd
in a
\fB hybrid mode\fR
where it is offers both user and share level security under different
NetBIOS aliases.
.sp
The different settings will now be explained.
.sp
\fBSECURITY = SHARE\fR
.sp
When clients connect to a share level security server they need not log onto the server with a valid username and password before attempting to connect to a shared resource (although modern clients such as Windows 95/98 and Windows NT will send a logon request with a username but no password when talking to a
security = share
server). Instead, the clients send authentication information (passwords) on a per-share basis, at the time they attempt to connect to that share.
.sp
Note that
smbd
\fBALWAYS\fR
uses a valid UNIX user to act on behalf of the client, even in
security = share
level security.
.sp
As clients are not required to send a username to the server in share level security,
smbd
uses several techniques to determine the correct UNIX user to use on behalf of the client.
.sp
A list of possible UNIX usernames to match with the given client password is constructed using the following methods :
.RS 3n
.TP 3n
\(bu
If the
guest only parameter is set, then all the other stages are missed and only the
guest account username is checked.
.TP 3n
\(bu
Is a username is sent with the share connection request, then this username (after mapping - see
username map), is added as a potential username.
.TP 3n
\(bu

\fBlogon \fR
request (the SessionSetup SMB call) then the username sent in this SMB will be added as a potential username.
.TP 3n

The name of the service the client requested is added as a potential username.
.TP 3n
\(bu
The NetBIOS name of the client is added to the list as a potential username.

.RE
.IP "" 3n
If the
\fIguest only\fR
parameter is not set, then this list is then tried with the supplied password. The first user for whom the password matches will be used as the UNIX user.
.sp
If the
\fIguest only\fR
parameter is set, or no username can be determined then if the share is marked as available to the
\fIguest account\fR, then this guest user will be used, otherwise access is denied.
.sp
Note that it can be
\fBvery\fR
confusing in share-level security as to which UNIX username will eventually be used in granting access.
.sp
See also the section
NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION.
.sp
\fBSECURITY = USER\fR
.sp
This is the default security setting in Samba 3.0. With user-level security a client must first "log-on" with a valid username and password (which can be mapped using the
username map parameter). Encrypted passwords (see the
encrypted passwords parameter) can also be used in this security mode. Parameters such as
user and
guest only if set are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
.sp
\fBNote\fR
that the name of the resource being requested is
\fBnot\fR
sent to the server until after the server has successfully authenticated the client. This is why guest shares don't work in user level security without allowing the server to automatically map unknown users into the
guest account. See the
map to guest parameter for details on doing this.
.sp
See also the section
NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION.
.sp
\fBSECURITY = DOMAIN\fR
.sp
This mode will only work correctly if
\fBnet\fR(8)
has been used to add this machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the
encrypted passwords parameter to be set to
\fByes\fR. In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.
.sp
\fBNote\fR
that a valid UNIX user must still exist as well as the account on the Domain Controller to allow Samba to have a valid UNIX account to map file access to.
.sp
\fBNote\fR
that from the client's point of view
security = domain
is the same as
security = user. It only affects how the server deals with the authentication, it does not in any way affect what the client sees.
.sp
\fBNote\fR
that the name of the resource being requested is

\fBSECURITY = SERVER\fR

In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box. If this fails it will revert to
security = user. It expects the
encrypted passwords parameter to be set to
\fByes\fR, unless the remote server does not support them. However note that if encrypted passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot revert back to checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid

This mode of operation has significant pitfalls since it is more vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and server impersonation. In particular, this mode of operation can cause significant resource consuption on the PDC, as it must maintain an active connection for the duration of the user's session. Furthermore, if this connection is lost, there is no way to reestablish it, and futher authentications to the Samba server may fail (from a single client, till it disconnects).

socket options (G)
.RS 3n
This option allows you to set socket options to be used when talking with the client.
.sp
Socket options are controls on the networking layer of the operating systems which allow the connection to be tuned.
.sp
This option will typically be used to tune your Samba server for optimal performance for your local network. There is no way that Samba can know what the optimal parameters are for your net, so you must experiment and choose them yourself. We strongly suggest you read the appropriate documentation for your operating system first (perhaps
man setsockopt
will help).
.sp
You may find that on some systems Samba will say "Unknown socket option" when you supply an option. This means you either incorrectly typed it or you need to add an include file to includes.h for your OS. If the latter is the case please send the patch to

store dos attributes (S)
.RS 3n
If this parameter is set Samba attempts to first read DOS attributes (SYSTEM, HIDDEN, ARCHIVE or READ-ONLY) from a filesystem extended attribute, before mapping DOS attributes to UNIX permission bits (such as occurs with
map hidden and
map readonly). When set, DOS attributes will be stored onto an extended attribute in the UNIX filesystem, associated with the file or directory. For no other mapping to occur as a fall-back, the parameters
map hidden,
map system,
map archive and
map readonly must be set to off. This parameter writes the DOS attributes as a string into the extended attribute named "user.DOSATTRIB". This extended attribute is explicitly hidden from smbd clients requesting an EA list. On Linux the filesystem must have been mounted with the mount option user_xattr in order for extended attributes to work, also extended attributes must be compiled into the Linux kernel.

This is a boolean that controls the handling of disk space allocation in the server. When this is set to

In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files. This can be slow on some systems.
.sp
When strict allocate is

strict locking (S)
.RS 3n
This is an enumerated type that controls the handling of file locking in the server. When this is set to
\fByes\fR, the server will check every read and write access for file locks, and deny access if locks exist. This can be slow on some systems.
.sp
When strict locking is set to Auto (the default), the server performs file lock checks only on non-oplocked files. As most Windows redirectors perform file locking checks locally on oplocked files this is a good trade off for inproved performance.
.sp
When strict locking is disabled, the server performs file lock checks only when the client explicitly asks for them.
.sp
Well-behaved clients always ask for lock checks when it is important. So in the vast majority of cases,
strict locking = Auto

strict sync (S)
.RS 3n
Many Windows applications (including the Windows 98 explorer shell) seem to confuse flushing buffer contents to disk with doing a sync to disk. Under UNIX, a sync call forces the process to be suspended until the kernel has ensured that all outstanding data in kernel disk buffers has been safely stored onto stable storage. This is very slow and should only be done rarely. Setting this parameter to
\fBno\fR
(the default) means that
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
ignores the Windows applications requests for a sync call. There is only a possibility of losing data if the operating system itself that Samba is running on crashes, so there is little danger in this default setting. In addition, this fixes many performance problems that people have reported with the new Windows98 explorer shell file copies.

update encrypted (G)
.RS 3n
This boolean parameter allows a user logging on with a plaintext password to have their encrypted (hashed) password in the smbpasswd file to be updated automatically as they log on. This option allows a site to migrate from plaintext password authentication (users authenticate with plaintext password over the wire, and are checked against a UNIX account atabase) to encrypted password authentication (the SMB challenge/response authentication mechanism) without forcing all users to re-enter their passwords via smbpasswd at the time the change is made. This is a convenience option to allow the change over to encrypted passwords to be made over a longer period. Once all users have encrypted representations of their passwords in the smbpasswd file this parameter should be set to

use client driver (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter applies only to Windows NT/2000 clients. It has no effect on Windows 95/98/ME clients. When serving a printer to Windows NT/2000 clients without first installing a valid printer driver on the Samba host, the client will be required to install a local printer driver. From this point on, the client will treat the print as a local printer and not a network printer connection. This is much the same behavior that will occur when
disable spoolss = yes.
.sp
The differentiating factor is that under normal circumstances, the NT/2000 client will attempt to open the network printer using MS-RPC. The problem is that because the client considers the printer to be local, it will attempt to issue the OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated with the logged on user. If the user possesses local administator rights but not root privilege on the Samba host (often the case), the OpenPrinterEx() call will fail. The result is that the client will now display an "Access Denied; Unable to connect" message in the printer queue window (even though jobs may successfully be printed).
.sp
If this parameter is enabled for a printer, then any attempt to open the printer with the PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER right is mapped to PRINTER_ACCESS_USE instead. Thus allowing the OpenPrinterEx() call to succeed.

username (S)
.RS 3n
Multiple users may be specified in a comma-delimited list, in which case the supplied password will be tested against each username in turn (left to right).
.sp
The
\fIusername\fR
line is needed only when the PC is unable to supply its own username. This is the case for the COREPLUS protocol or where your users have different WfWg usernames to UNIX usernames. In both these cases you may also be better using the \\server\share%user syntax instead.
.sp
The
\fIusername\fR
line is not a great solution in many cases as it means Samba will try to validate the supplied password against each of the usernames in the
\fIusername\fR
line in turn. This is slow and a bad idea for lots of users in case of duplicate passwords. You may get timeouts or security breaches using this parameter unwisely.
.sp
Samba relies on the underlying UNIX security. This parameter does not restrict who can login, it just offers hints to the Samba server as to what usernames might correspond to the supplied password. Users can login as whoever they please and they will be able to do no more damage than if they started a telnet session. The daemon runs as the user that they log in as, so they cannot do anything that user cannot do.
.sp
To restrict a service to a particular set of users you can use the
valid users parameter.
.sp
If any of the usernames begin with a '@' then the name will be looked up first in the NIS netgroups list (if Samba is compiled with netgroup support), followed by a lookup in the UNIX groups database and will expand to a list of all users in the group of that name.
.sp
If any of the usernames begin with a '+' then the name will be looked up only in the UNIX groups database and will expand to a list of all users in the group of that name.
.sp
If any of the usernames begin with a '&' then the name will be looked up only in the NIS netgroups database (if Samba is compiled with netgroup support) and will expand to a list of all users in the netgroup group of that name.

username level (G)

This option helps Samba to try and 'guess' at the real UNIX username, as many DOS clients send an all-uppercase username. By default Samba tries all lowercase, followed by the username with the first letter capitalized, and fails if the username is not found on the UNIX machine.
.sp
If this parameter is set to non-zero the behavior changes. This parameter is a number that specifies the number of uppercase combinations to try while trying to determine the UNIX user name. The higher the number the more combinations will be tried, but the slower the discovery of usernames will be. Use this parameter when you have strange usernames on your UNIX machine, such as

.RE
.PP
username map (G)
.RS 3n
This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server. This can be used for several purposes. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files.
.sp
Please note that for user or share mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user credentials. Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified enties in the map table (e.g. biddle = DOMAIN\foo).
.sp
The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a '=' followed by a list of usernames on the right. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group. The special client name '*' is a wildcard and matches any name. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long.
.sp
The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the '=' signs. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left. Processing then continues with the next line.
.sp
If any line begins with a '#' or a ';' then it is ignored.
.sp
If any line begins with an '!' then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line. Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed. Using '!' is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file.
.sp
For example to map from the name
\fBadmin\fR
or
\fBadministrator\fR
to the UNIX name
\fB root\fR
you would use:

.sp

.nf

root = admin administrator

.fi
Or to map anyone in the UNIX group
\fBsystem\fR
to the UNIX name
\fBsys\fR
you would use:

.sp

.nf

sys = @system

.fi

.sp
You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file.
.sp
If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup database is checked before the
\fI/etc/group \fR
database for matching groups.
.sp
You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double quotes around the name. For example:

.sp

.nf

tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"

.fi
would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username "tridge".
.sp
The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest. Note the use of the '!' to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:

.sp

.nf

!sys = mary fred
guest = *

.fi

.sp
Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames. Thus if you connect to \\server\fred and
\fBfred\fR
is remapped to
\fBmary\fR
then you will actually be connecting to \\server\mary and will need to supply a password suitable for
\fBmary\fR
not
\fBfred\fR. The only exception to this is the username passed to the
password server (if you have one). The password server will receive whatever username the client supplies without modification.
.sp
Also note that no reverse mapping is done. The main effect this has is with printing. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don't own the print job.
.sp
Samba versions prior to 3.0.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e.g.: DOMAIN\user) from the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client. However, when looking up a map entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be used for matches. This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes even on the same server.
.sp
The following functionality is obeyed in version 3.0.8 and later:
.sp
When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate the connection.
.sp
When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map to the fully qualified username (i.e. DOMAIN\user) only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
.sp
An example of use is:

User defined shares only have limited possible parameters such as path, guest ok etc. This parameter allows usershares to "cloned" from an existing share. If "usershare template share" is set to the name of an existing share, then all usershares created have their defaults set from the parameters set on this share.
.sp
The target share may be set to be invalid for real file sharing by setting the parameter "-valid = False" on the template share definition. This causes it not to be seen as a real exported share but to be able to be used as a template for usershares.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIusershare template share\fR = NULL \fR
.sp
Example:
\fB\fIusershare template share\fR = template_share \fR
.RE
.PP
use sendfile (S)
.RS 3n
If this parameter is
\fByes\fR, and the
\fBsendfile()\fR
system call is supported by the underlying operating system, then some SMB read calls (mainly ReadAndX and ReadRaw) will use the more efficient sendfile system call for files that are exclusively oplocked. This may make more efficient use of the system CPU's and cause Samba to be faster. Samba automatically turns this off for clients that use protocol levels lower than NT LM 0.12 and when it detects a client is Windows 9x (using sendfile from Linux will cause these clients to fail).
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIuse sendfile\fR = false \fR
.RE
.PP
use spnego (G)
.RS 3n
This variable controls controls whether samba will try to use Simple and Protected NEGOciation (as specified by rfc2478) with WindowsXP and Windows2000 clients to agree upon an authentication mechanism.
.sp
Unless further issues are discovered with our SPNEGO implementation, there is no reason this should ever be disabled.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIuse spnego\fR = yes \fR
.RE
.PP
utmp (G)
.RS 3n
This boolean parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled with the option
--with-utmp. If set to
\fByes\fR
then Samba will attempt to add utmp or utmpx records (depending on the UNIX system) whenever a connection is made to a Samba server. Sites may use this to record the user connecting to a Samba share.
.sp
Due to the requirements of the utmp record, we are required to create a unique identifier for the incoming user. Enabling this option creates an n^2 algorithm to find this number. This may impede performance on large installations.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIutmp\fR = no \fR
.RE
.PP
utmp directory (G)
.RS 3n
This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled with the option
--with-utmp. It specifies a directory pathname that is used to store the utmp or utmpx files (depending on the UNIX system) that record user connections to a Samba server. By default this is not set, meaning the system will use whatever utmp file the native system is set to use (usually
\fI/var/run/utmp\fR
on Linux).
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIutmp directory\fR = # Determined automatically \fR
.sp
Example:
\fB\fIutmp directory\fR = /var/run/utmp \fR
.RE
.PP
-valid (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter indicates whether a share is valid and thus can be used. When this parameter is set to false, the share will be in no way visible nor accessible.
.sp
This option should not be used by regular users but might be of help to developers. Samba uses this option internally to mark shares as deleted.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fI-valid\fR = yes \fR
.RE
.PP
valid users (S)
.RS 3n
This is a list of users that should be allowed to login to this service. Names starting with '@', '+' and '&' are interpreted using the same rules as described in the
\fIinvalid users\fR
parameter.
.sp
If this is empty (the default) then any user can login. If a username is in both this list and the
\fIinvalid users\fR
list then access is denied for that user.
.sp
The current servicename is substituted for
\fI%S\fR. This is useful in the [homes] section.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIvalid users\fR = # No valid users list (anyone can login) \fR
.sp
Example:
\fB\fIvalid users\fR = greg, @pcusers \fR
.RE
.PP
veto files (S)
.RS 3n
This is a list of files and directories that are neither visible nor accessible. Each entry in the list must be separated by a '/', which allows spaces to be included in the entry. '*' and '?' can be used to specify multiple files or directories as in DOS wildcards.
.sp
Each entry must be a unix path, not a DOS path and must
\fBnot\fR
include the unix directory separator '/'.
.sp
Note that the
case sensitive option is applicable in vetoing files.
.sp
One feature of the veto files parameter that it is important to be aware of is Samba's behaviour when trying to delete a directory. If a directory that is to be deleted contains nothing but veto files this deletion will
\fBfail\fR
unless you also set the
delete veto files parameter to
\fIyes\fR.
.sp
Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, as it will be forced to check all files and directories for a match as they are scanned.
.sp
Examples of use include:

.sp

.nf

; Veto any files containing the word Security,
; any ending in .tmp, and any directory containing the
; word root.
veto files = /*Security*/*.tmp/*root*/

; Veto the Apple specific files that a NetAtalk server
; creates.
veto files = /.AppleDouble/.bin/.AppleDesktop/Network Trash Folder/

.fi

.sp
Default:
\fB\fIveto files\fR = No files or directories are vetoed. \fR
.RE
.PP
veto oplock files (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter is only valid when the
oplocks parameter is turned on for a share. It allows the Samba administrator to selectively turn off the granting of oplocks on selected files that match a wildcarded list, similar to the wildcarded list used in the
veto files parameter.
.sp
You might want to do this on files that you know will be heavily contended for by clients. A good example of this is in the NetBench SMB benchmark program, which causes heavy client contention for files ending in
\fI.SEM\fR. To cause Samba not to grant oplocks on these files you would use the line (either in the [global] section or in the section for the particular NetBench share.
.sp
An example of use is:

.sp

.nf

veto oplock files = /.*SEM/

.fi

.sp
Default:
\fB\fIveto oplock files\fR = # No files are vetoed for oplock grants \fR

vfs objects (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter specifies the backend names which are used for Samba VFS I/O operations. By default, normal disk I/O operations are used but these can be overloaded with one or more VFS objects.

Default:
\fB\fIvfs objects\fR = \fR
.sp
Example:
\fB\fIvfs objects\fR = extd_audit recycle \fR
.RE
.PP
volume (S)
.RS 3n
This allows you to override the volume label returned for a share. Useful for CDROMs with installation programs that insist on a particular volume label.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIvolume\fR = # the name of the share \fR
.RE
.PP
wide links (S)
.RS 3n
This parameter controls whether or not links in the UNIX file system may be followed by the server. Links that point to areas within the directory tree exported by the server are always allowed; this parameter controls access only to areas that are outside the directory tree being exported.
.sp
Note that setting this parameter can have a negative effect on your server performance due to the extra system calls that Samba has to do in order to perform the link checks.
.sp
Default:

.RS 3n
This parameter specifies the number of seconds the

winbind expand groups (G)
.RS 3n
This option controls the maximum depth that winbindd will traverse when flattening nested group memberships of Windows domain groups. This is different from the
winbind nested groups option which implements the Windows NT4 model of local group nesting. The "winbind expand groups" parameter specifically applies to the membership of domain groups.
.sp
Be aware that a high value for this parameter can result in system slowdown as the main parent winbindd daemon must perform the group unrolling and will be unable to answer incoming NSS or authentication requests during this time.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIwinbind expand groups\fR = 1 \fR
.RE
.PP
winbind nested groups (G)
.RS 3n
If set to yes, this parameter activates the support for nested groups. Nested groups are also called local groups or aliases. They work like their counterparts in Windows: Nested groups are defined locally on any machine (they are shared between DC's through their SAM) and can contain users and global groups from any trusted SAM. To be able to use nested groups, you need to run nss_winbind.
.sp
Default:
\fB\fIwinbind nested groups\fR = yes \fR

winbind normalize names (G)
.RS 3n
This parameter controls whether winbindd will replace whitespace in user and group names with an underscore (_) character. For example, whether the name "Space Kadet" should be replaced with the string "space_kadet". Frequently Unix shell scripts will have difficulty with usernames contains whitespace due to the default field separator in the shell. Do not enable this option if the underscore character is used in account names within your domain

wins hook (G)
.RS 3n
When Samba is running as a WINS server this allows you to call an external program for all changes to the WINS database. The primary use for this option is to allow the dynamic update of external name resolution databases such as dynamic DNS.
.sp
The wins hook parameter specifies the name of a script or executable that will be called as follows:
.sp
wins_hook operation name nametype ttl IP_list
.RS 3n
.TP 3n
\(bu
The first argument is the operation and is one of "add", "delete", or "refresh". In most cases the operation can be ignored as the rest of the parameters provide sufficient information. Note that "refresh" may sometimes be called when the name has not previously been added, in that case it should be treated as an add.
.TP 3n
\(bu
The second argument is the NetBIOS name. If the name is not a legal name then the wins hook is not called. Legal names contain only letters, digits, hyphens, underscores and periods.
.TP 3n
\(bu
The third argument is the NetBIOS name type as a 2 digit hexadecimal number.

write cache size (S)
.RS 3n
If this integer parameter is set to non-zero value, Samba will create an in-memory cache for each oplocked file (it does
\fBnot\fR
do this for non-oplocked files). All writes that the client does not request to be flushed directly to disk will be stored in this cache if possible. The cache is flushed onto disk when a write comes in whose offset would not fit into the cache or when the file is closed by the client. Reads for the file are also served from this cache if the data is stored within it.
.sp
This cache allows Samba to batch client writes into a more efficient write size for RAID disks (i.e. writes may be tuned to be the RAID stripe size) and can improve performance on systems where the disk subsystem is a bottleneck but there is free memory for userspace programs.

The integer parameter specifies the size of this cache (per oplocked file) in bytes.
