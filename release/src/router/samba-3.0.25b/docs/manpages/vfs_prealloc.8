.SH "NAME"
vfs_prealloc - preallocate matching files to a predetermined size
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 1
vfs objects = prealloc
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This VFS module is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite.
.PP
The
vfs_prealloc
VFS module preallocates files to a specified size each time a new file is created. This is useful in environments where files are of a predetermined size will be written to a disk subsystem where extending file allocations is expensive.
.PP
This module is stackable.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
prealloc:EXT = BYTES
.RS 3n
Preallocate all files with the extension EXT to the size specified by BYTES.
.sp
The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:
.RS 3n
.TP 3n
\(bu
K
- BYTES is a number of kilobytes
.TP 3n
\(bu
M
- BYTES is a number of megabytes

A process writes TIFF files to a Samba share, and the is known these files will almost always be around 4 megabytes (4194304 bytes):

.nf

	path = /data/frames
	vfs objects = prealloc
	prealloc:tiff = 4M
