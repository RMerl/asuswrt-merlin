.SH "NAME"
net - Tool for administration of Samba and remote CIFS servers.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 1
net {<ads|rap|rpc>} [-h] [-w workgroup] [-W myworkgroup] [-U user] [-I ip-address] [-p port] [-n myname] [-s conffile] [-S server] [-l] [-P] [-d debuglevel] [-V]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite.
.PP
The samba net utility is meant to work just like the net utility available for windows and DOS. The first argument should be used to specify the protocol to use when executing a certain command. ADS is used for ActiveDirectory, RAP is using for old (Win9x/NT3) clients and RPC can be used for NT4 and Windows 2000. If this argument is omitted, net will try to determine it automatically. Not all commands are available on all protocols.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
-h|--help
.RS 3n
Print a summary of command line options.
.RE
.PP
-w target-workgroup
.RS 3n
Sets target workgroup or domain. You have to specify either this option or the IP address or the name of a server.
.RE
.PP
-W workgroup
.RS 3n
Sets client workgroup or domain
.RE
.PP
-U user
.RS 3n
User name to use
.RE
.PP
-I ip-address
.RS 3n
IP address of target server to use. You have to specify either this option or a target workgroup or a target server.
.RE
.PP
-p port
.RS 3n
Port on the target server to connect to (usually 139 or 445). Defaults to trying 445 first, then 139.
.RE
.PP
-n <primary NetBIOS name>
.RS 3n
This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical to setting the

parameter in the
\fIsmb.conf\fR
file. However, a command line setting will take precedence over settings in
\fIsmb.conf\fR.
.RE
.PP
-s <configuration file>
.RS 3n
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See
\fIsmb.conf\fR
for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.
.RE
.PP
-S server
.RS 3n
Name of target server. You should specify either this option or a target workgroup or a target IP address.
.RE
.PP
-l
.RS 3n
When listing data, give more information on each item.
.RE
.PP
-P
.RS 3n
Make queries to the external server using the machine account of the local server.
.RE
.PP
-d|--debuglevel=level
.RS 3n
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the

parameter in the
\fIsmb.conf\fR
file.
.RE
.SH "COMMANDS"
.SS "CHANGESECRETPW"
.PP
This command allows the Samba machine account password to be set from an external application to a machine account password that has already been stored in Active Directory. DO NOT USE this command unless you know exactly what you are doing. The use of this command requires that the force flag (-f) be used also. There will be NO command prompt. Whatever information is piped into stdin, either by typing at the command line or otherwise, will be stored as the literal machine password. Do NOT use this without care and attention as it will overwrite a legitimate machine password without warning. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
.SS "TIME"
.PP
The
NET TIME
command allows you to view the time on a remote server or synchronise the time on the local server with the time on the remote server.

.SS "TIME"
.PP
Without any options, the
NET TIME
command displays the time on the remote server.

.SS "TIME SYSTEM"
.PP
Displays the time on the remote server in a format ready for
/bin/date

.SS "TIME SET"
.PP
Tries to set the date and time of the local server to that on the remote server using
/bin/date.

.SS "TIME ZONE"
.PP
Displays the timezone in hours from GMT on the remote computer.
.SS "[RPC|ADS] JOIN [TYPE] [-U username[%password]] [createupn=UPN] [createcomputer=OU] [options]"
.PP
Join a domain. If the account already exists on the server, and [TYPE] is MEMBER, the machine will attempt to join automatically. (Assuming that the machine has been created in server manager) Otherwise, a password will be prompted for, and a new account may be created.

[TYPE] may be PDC, BDC or MEMBER to specify the type of server joining the domain.
.PP
[UPN] (ADS only) set the principalname attribute during the join. The default format is host/netbiosname@REALM.
.PP
[OU] (ADS only) Precreate the computer account in a specific OU. The OU string reads from top to bottom without RDNs, and is delimited by a '/'. Please note that '\' is used for escape by both the shell and ldap, so it may need to be doubled or quadrupled to pass through, and it is not used as a delimiter.

.SS "USERSHARE"
.PP
Starting with version 3.0.23, a Samba server now supports the ability for non-root users to add user define shares to be exported using the "net usershare" commands.
.PP
To set this up, first set up your smb.conf by adding to the [global] section : usershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares Next create the directory /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares, change the owner to root and set the group owner to the UNIX group who should have the ability to create usershares, for example a group called "serverops". Set the permissions on /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares to 01770. (Owner and group all access, no access for others, plus the sticky bit, which means that a file in that directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the file). Finally, tell smbd how many usershares you will allow by adding to the [global] section of smb.conf a line such as : usershare max shares = 100. To allow 100 usershare definitions. Now, members of the UNIX group "serverops" can create user defined shares on demand using the commands below.
.PP
The usershare commands are:
.IP "" 3n
net usershare add sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]] - to add or change a user defined share.
.IP "" 3n
net usershare delete sharename - to delete a user defined share.
.IP "" 3n
net usershare info [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename] - to print info about a user defined share.
.IP "" 3n
net usershare list [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename] - to list user defined shares.


.SS "USERSHARE ADD sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]"
.PP
Add or replace a new user defined share, with name "sharename".
.PP
"path" specifies the absolute pathname on the system to be exported. Restrictions may be put on this, see the global smb.conf parameters : "usershare owner only", "usershare prefix allow list", and "usershare prefix deny list".
.PP
The optional "comment" parameter is the comment that will appear on the share when browsed to by a client.
.PP
The optional "acl" field specifies which users have read and write access to the entire share. Note that guest connections are not allowed unless the smb.conf parameter "usershare allow guests" has been set. The definition of a user defined share acl is : "user:permission", where user is a valid username on the system and permission can be "F", "R", or "D". "F" stands for "full permissions", ie. read and write permissions. "D" stands for "deny" for a user, ie. prevent this user from accessing this share. "R" stands for "read only", ie. only allow read access to this share (no creation of new files or directories or writing to files).
.PP
The default if no "acl" is given is "Everyone:R", which means any authenticated user has read-only access.
.PP
The optional "guest_ok" has the same effect as the parameter of the same name in smb.conf, in that it allows guest access to this user defined share. This parameter is only allowed if the global parameter "usershare allow guests" has been set to true in the smb.conf.


There is no separate command to modify an existing user defined share,
just use the "net usershare add [sharename]" command using the same
sharename as the one you wish to modify and specify the new options
you wish. The Samba smbd daemon notices user defined share modifications
at connect time so will see the change immediately, there is no need
to restart smbd on adding, deleting or changing a user defined share.

.SS "USERSHARE DELETE sharename"
.PP
Deletes the user defined share by name. The Samba smbd daemon immediately notices this change, although it will not disconnect any users currently connected to the deleted share.

.SS "USERSHARE INFO [-l|--long] [wildcard sharename]"
.PP
Get info on user defined shares owned by the current user matching the given pattern, or all users.
.PP
net usershare info on its own dumps out info on the user defined shares that were created by the current user, or restricts them to share names that match the given wildcard pattern ('*' matches one or more characters, '?' matches only one character). If the '-l' or '--long' option is also given, it prints out info on user defined shares created by other users.
.PP
The information given about a share looks like : [foobar] path=/home/jeremy comment=testme usershare_acl=Everyone:F guest_ok=n And is a list of the current settings of the user defined share that can be modified by the "net usershare add" command.

.SS "USERSHARE LIST [-l|--long] wildcard sharename"
.PP
List all the user defined shares owned by the current user matching the given pattern, or all users.
.PP
net usershare list on its own list out the names of the user defined shares that were created by the current user, or restricts the list to share names that match the given wildcard pattern ('*' matches one or more characters, '?' matches only one character). If the '-l' or '--long' option is also given, it includes the names of user defined shares created by other users.
.SS "HELP [COMMAND]"
.PP
Gives usage information for the specified command.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
