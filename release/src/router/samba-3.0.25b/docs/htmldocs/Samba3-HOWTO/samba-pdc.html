There are many who approach MS Windows networking with incredible misconceptions.
That's okay, because it gives the rest of us plenty of opportunity to be of assistance.
Those who really want help are well advised to become familiar with information
that is already available.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id327547"></a>
You are advised not to tackle this section without having first understood
and mastered some basics. MS Windows networking is not particularly forgiving of
misconfiguration. Users of MS Windows networking are likely to complain 
of persistent niggles that may be caused by a broken network configuration.
To a great many people, however, MS Windows networking starts with a domain controller
that in some magical way is expected to solve all network operational ills.
</p><p>
<a href="samba-pdc.html#domain-example" title="Figure 4.1. An Example Domain.">The Example Domain Illustration</a> shows a typical MS Windows domain security
network environment. Workstations A, B, and C are representative of many physical MS Windows
network clients.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="domain-example"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.1. An Example Domain.</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/domain.png" width="216" alt="An Example Domain."></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
From the Samba mailing list we can readily identify many common networking issues.
If you are not clear on the following subjects, then it will do much good to read the 
sections of this HOWTO that deal with it. These are the most common causes of MS Windows
networking problems:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Basic TCP/IP configuration.</p></li><li><p>NetBIOS name resolution.</p></li><li><p>Authentication configuration.</p></li><li><p>User and group configuration.</p></li><li><p>Basic file and directory permission control in UNIX/Linux.</p></li><li><p>Understanding how MS Windows clients interoperate in a network environment.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Do not be put off; on the surface of it MS Windows networking seems so simple that anyone 
can do it. In fact, it is not a good idea to set up an MS Windows network with
inadequate training and preparation. But let's get our first indelible principle out of the
way: <span class="emphasis"><em>It is perfectly okay to make mistakes!</em></span> In the right place and at
the right time, mistakes are the essence of learning. It is very much not okay to make
mistakes that cause loss of productivity and impose an avoidable financial burden on an
organization.
</p><p>
Where is the right place to make mistakes? Only out of harms way. If you are going to
make mistakes, then please do it on a test network, away from users, and in such a way as
to not inflict pain on others. Do your learning on a test network.

In a word, <span class="emphasis"><em>single sign-on</em></span>, or SSO for short. To many, this is the Holy Grail of MS
Windows NT and beyond networking. SSO allows users in a well-designed network to log onto any workstation that
is a member of the domain that contains their user account (or in a domain that has an appropriate trust
relationship with the domain they are visiting) and they will be able to log onto the network and access
resources (shares, files, and printers) as if they are sitting at their home (personal) workstation. This is a
feature of the domain security protocols.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id327735"></a>

<a class="indexterm" name="id327757"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id327766"></a>
The benefits of domain security are available to those sites that deploy a Samba PDC.  A domain provides a
unique network security identifier (SID). Domain user and group security identifiers are comprised of the
network SID plus a relative identifier (RID) that is unique to the account. User and group SIDs (the network
SID plus the RID) can be used to create access control lists (ACLs) attached to network resources to provide
organizational access control. UNIX systems recognize only local security identifiers.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id327780"></a>
A SID represents a security context. For example, every Windows machine has local accounts within the security
context of the local machine which has a unique SID. Every domain (NT4, ADS, Samba) contains accounts that
exist within the domain security context which is defined by the domain SID.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id327793"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id327799"></a>
A domain member server will have a SID that differs from the domain SID.  The domain member server can be
configured to regard all domain users as local users. It can also be configured to recognize domain users and
groups as non-local. SIDs are persistent. A typical domain of user SID looks like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
S-1-5-21-726309263-4128913605-1168186429
</pre><p>
Every account (user, group, machine, trust, etc.) is assigned a RID. This is done automatically as an account
is created. Samba produces the RID algorithmically. The UNIX operating system uses a separate name space for
user and group identifiers (the UID and GID) but Windows allocates the RID from a single name space. A Windows
user and a Windows group can not have the same RID. Just as the UNIX user <code class="literal">root</code> has the
UID=0, the Windows Administrator has the well-known RID=500. The RID is catenated to the Windows domain SID,
so Administrator account for a domain that has the above SID will have the user SID
</p><pre class="screen">
S-1-5-21-726309263-4128913605-1168186429-500
</pre><p>
The result is that every account in the Windows networking world has a globally unique security identifier.

Network clients of an MS Windows domain security environment must be domain members to be able to gain access
to the advanced features provided. Domain membership involves more than just setting the workgroup name to the
domain name. It requires the creation of a domain trust account for the workstation (called a machine
account). Refer to <a href="domain-member.html" title="Chapter 6. Domain Membership">Domain Membership</a> for more information.

The following functionalities are new to the Samba-3 release:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id327882"></a>
	Samba-3 supports the use of a choice of backends that may be used in which user, group and machine
	accounts may be stored. Multiple passwd backends can be used in combination, either as additive backend
	data sets, or as fail-over data sets.
	</p><p>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id327917"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id327924"></a>
	An LDAP passdb backend confers the benefit that the account backend can be distributed and replicated,
	which is of great value because it confers scalability and provides a high degree of reliability.

	Windows NT4 domain trusts. Samba-3 supports workstation and server (machine) trust accounts. It also
	supports Windows NT4 style interdomain trust accounts, which further assists in network scalability
	and interoperability.

	Operation without NetBIOS over TCP/IP, rather using the raw SMB over TCP/IP. Note, this is feasible
	only when operating as a Microsoft active directory domain member server. When acting as a Samba domain
	controller the use of NetBIOS is necessary to provide network browsing support.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id328026"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id328032"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id328039"></a>
	Samba-3 provides NetBIOS name services (WINS), NetBIOS over TCP/IP (TCP port 139) session services, SMB over
	TCP/IP (TCP port 445) session services, and Microsoft compatible ONC DCE RPC services (TCP port 135)
	services.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id328052"></a>
	Management of users and groups via the User Manager for Domains. This can be done on any MS Windows client
	using the <code class="filename">Nexus.exe</code> toolkit for Windows 9x/Me, or using the SRVTOOLS.EXE package for MS
	Windows NT4/200x/XP platforms. These packages are available from Microsoft's Web site.
	</p></li><li><p>
	Implements full Unicode support. This simplifies cross-locale internationalization support. It also opens up
	the use of protocols that Samba-2.2.x had but could not use due to the need to fully support Unicode.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id328092"></a>
	SAM replication with Windows NT4 domain controllers (i.e., a Samba PDC and a Windows NT BDC, or vice versa).
	This means Samba cannot operate as a BDC when the PDC is Microsoft-based Windows NT PDC. Samba-3 can not
	participate in replication of account data to Windows PDCs and BDCs.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id328105"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id328112"></a>
	Acting as a Windows 2000 active directory domain controller (i.e., Kerberos and Active Directory). In point of
	fact, Samba-3 does have some Active Directory domain control ability that is at this time purely experimental.
	Active directory domain control is one of the features that is being developed in Samba-4, the next
	generation Samba release. At this time there are no plans to enable active directory domain control
	support during the Samba-3 series life-cycle.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id328144"></a>
	The Windows 200x/XP Microsoft Management Console (MMC) cannot be used to manage a Samba-3 server. For this you
	can use only the MS Windows NT4 Domain Server Manager and the MS Windows NT4 Domain User Manager. Both are
	part of the SVRTOOLS.EXE package mentioned later.

Windows 9x/Me/XP Home clients are not true members of a domain for reasons outlined in this chapter. The
protocol for support of Windows 9x/Me-style network (domain) logons is completely different from NT4/Windows
200x-type domain logons and has been officially supported for some time. These clients use the old LanMan
network logon facilities that are supported in Samba since approximately the Samba-1.9.15 series.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328180"></a>
Samba-3 implements group mapping between Windows NT groups and UNIX groups (this is really quite complicated
to explain in a short space). This is discussed more fully in <a href="groupmapping.html" title="Chapter 12. Group Mapping: MS Windows and UNIX">Group Mapping: MS

Samba-3, like an MS Windows NT4 PDC or a Windows 200x Active Directory, needs to store user and Machine Trust
Account information in a suitable backend data-store.  Refer to <a href="domain-member.html#machine-trust-accounts" title="MS Windows Workstation/Server Machine Trust Accounts">MS
Windows Workstation/Server Machine Trust Accounts</a>. With Samba-3 there can be multiple backends for
this. A complete discussion of account database backends can be found in <a href="passdb.html" title="Chapter 11. Account Information Databases">Account
Information Databases</a>.

When network administrators  are asked to describe the benefits of Windows NT4 and active directory networking
the most often mentioned feature is that of single sign-on (SSO). Many companies have implemented SSO
solutions. The mode of implementation of a single sign-on solution is an important factor in the practice of
networking in general, and is critical in respect of Windows networking. A company may have a wide variety of
information systems, each of which requires a form of user authentication and validation, thus it is not
uncommon that users may need to remember more than ten login IDs and passwords. This problem is compounded
when the password for each system must be changed at regular intervals, and particularly so where password
uniqueness and history limits are applied.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328311"></a>
There is a broadly held perception that SSO is the answer to the problem of users having to deal with too many
information system access credentials (username/password pairs). Many elaborate schemes have been devised to
make it possible to deliver a user-friendly SSO solution. The trouble is that if this implementation is not
done correctly, the site may end up paying dearly by way of complexity and management overheads. Simply put,
many SSO solutions are an administrative nightmare.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328325"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328332"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328339"></a>
SSO implementations utilize centralization of all user account information. Depending on environmental
complexity and the age of the systems over which a SSO solution is implemented, it may not be possible to
change the solution architecture so as to accomodate a new identity management and user authentication system.
Many SSO solutions involving legacy systems consist of a new super-structure that handles authentication on
behalf of the user. The software that gets layered over the old system may simply implement a proxy
authentication system. This means that the addition of SSO increases over-all information systems complexity.
Ideally, the implementation of SSO should reduce complexity and reduce administative overheads.

<a class="indexterm" name="id328387"></a>
The initial goal of many network administrators is often to create and use a centralized identity management
system. It is often assumed that such a centralized system will use a single authentication infrastructure
that can be used by all information systems. The Microsoft Windows NT4 security domain architecture and the
Micrsoft active directory service are often put forward as the ideal foundation for such a system. It is
conceptually simple to install an external authentication agent on each of the disparate infromation systems
that can then use the Microsoft (NT4 domain or ads service) for user authentication and access control. The
wonderful dream of a single centralized authentication service is commonly broken when realities are realized.
The problem with legacy systems is often the inability to externalize the authentication and access control
system it uses because its implementation will be excessively invasive from a re-engineering perspective, or
because application software has built-in dependencies on particular elements of the way user authentication
and access control were designed and built.

Over the past decade an industry has been developed around the various methods that have been built to get
around the key limitations of legacy information technology systems. One approach that is often used involves
the use of a meta-directory. The meta-directory stores user credentials for all disparate information systems
in the format that is particular to each system. An elaborate set of management procedures is coupled with a
rigidly enforced work-flow protocol for managing user rights and privileges within the maze of systems that
are provisioned by the new infrastructure makes possible user access to all systems using a single set of user
credentials.

The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) has developed the Security
Assertion Markup Language (SAML), a structured method for communication of authentication information. The
over-all umbrella name for the technologies and methods that deploy SAML is called Federated Identity
Management (FIM). FIM depends on each system in the complex maze of disparate information systems to
authenticate their respective users and vouch for secure access to the services each provides.
</p><p>

<a class="indexterm" name="id328548"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328553"></a>
SAML documents can be wrapped in a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) message for the computer-to-computer
communications needed for Web services. Or they may be passed between Web servers of federated organizations
that share live services. The Liberty Alliance, an industry group formed to promote federated-identity
standards, has adopted SAML 1.1 as part of its application framework. Microsoft and IBM have proposed an
alternative specification called WS-Security. Some believe that the competing technologies and methods may
converge when the SAML 2.0 standard is introduced. A few Web access-management products support SAML today,
but implemention of the technology mostly requires customization to integrate applications and develop user
interfaces. In a nust-shell, that is why FIM is a big and growing industry.

<a class="indexterm" name="id328596"></a>
Ignoring the bigger picture, which is beyond the scope of this book, the migration of all user and group
management to a centralized system is a step in the right direction. It is essential for interoperability
reasons to locate the identity management system data in a directory such as Microsoft Active Directory
Service (ADS), or any proprietary or open source system that provides a standard protocol for information
access (such as LDAP) and that can be coupled with a flexible array of authentication mechanisms (such as
kerberos) that use the protocols that are defined by the various general security service application
programming interface (GSSAPI) services.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328614"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328621"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328628"></a>
A growing number of companies provide authentication agents for disparate legacy platforms to permit the use
of LDAP systems. Thus the use of OpenLDAP, the dominant open source software implementation of the light
weight directory access protocol standard. This fact, means that by providing support in Samba for the use of
LDAP and Microsoft ADS make Samba a highly scalable and forward reaching organizational networking technology.
</p><p>

<a class="indexterm" name="id328668"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328675"></a>
Microsoft ADS provides purely proprietary services that, with limitation, can be extended to provide a
centralized authentication infrastructure. Samba plus LDAP provides a similar opportunity for extension of a
centralized authentication architecture, but it is the fact that the Samba Team are pro-active in introducing
the extension of authentication services, using LDAP or otherwise, to applications such as SQUID (the open
source proxy server) through tools such as the <code class="literal">ntlm_auth</code> utility, that does much to create
sustainable choice and competition in the FIM market place.

Primary domain control, if it is to be scalable to meet the needs of large sites, must therefore be capable of
using LDAP. The rapid adoption of OpenLDAP, and Samba configurations that use it, is ample proof that the era
of the directoy has started. Samba-3 does not demand the use of LDAP, but the demand for a mechanism by which
user and group identity information can be distributed makes it an an unavoidable option.

At this time, the use of Samba based BDCs, necessitates the use of LDAP. The most commonly used LDAP
implementation used by Samba sites is OpenLDAP. It is possible to use any standards compliant LDAP server.
Those known to work includes those manufactured by: IBM, CA, Novell (e-Directory), and others.

<a class="indexterm" name="id328756"></a>
Over the years, public perceptions of what domain control really is has taken on an almost mystical nature.
Before we branch into a brief overview of domain control, there are three basic types of domain controllers.

The <span class="emphasis"><em>Primary Domain Controller</em></span> or PDC plays an important role in MS Windows NT4. In
Windows 200x domain control architecture, this role is held by domain controllers.  Folklore dictates that
because of its role in the MS Windows network, the domain controller should be the most powerful and most
capable machine in the network.  As strange as it may seem to say this here, good overall network performance
dictates that the entire infrastructure needs to be balanced. It is advisable to invest more in standalone
(domain member) servers than in the domain controllers.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328836"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328843"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328849"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328856"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328863"></a>
In the case of MS Windows NT4-style domains, it is the PDC that initiates a new domain control database.
This forms a part of the Windows registry called the Security Account Manager (SAM). It plays a key
part in NT4-type domain user authentication and in synchronization of the domain authentication
database with BDCs. 
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328878"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328890"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328896"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328906"></a>
With MS Windows 200x Server-based Active Directory domains, one domain controller initiates a potential
hierarchy of domain controllers, each with its own area of delegated control. The master domain
controller has the ability to override any downstream controller, but a downline controller has
control only over its downline. With Samba-3, this functionality can be implemented using an
LDAP-based user and machine account backend.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328919"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328926"></a>
New to Samba-3 is the ability to use a backend database that holds the same type of data as the NT4-style SAM
database (one of the registry files)<sup>[<a name="id328934" href="#ftn.id328934">1</a>]</sup>
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id328950"></a>

<a class="indexterm" name="id328983"></a>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>Backup Domain Controller</em></span> or BDC plays a key role in servicing network authentication
requests. The BDC is biased to answer logon requests in preference to the PDC.  On a network segment that has
a BDC and a PDC, the BDC will most likely service network logon requests. The PDC will answer network logon
requests when the BDC is too busy (high load). When a user logs onto a Windows domain member client the
workstation will query the network to locate the nearest network logon server. Where a WINS server is used,
this is done via a query to the WINS server. If a netlogon server can not be found from the WINS query, or in
the absence of a WINS server, the workstation will perform a NetBIOS name lookup via a mailslot broadcast over
the UDP broadcast protocol. This means that the netlogon server that the windows client will use is influenced
by a number of variables, thus there is no simple determinant of whether a PDC or a BDC will serve a
particular logon authentication request.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329005"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329012"></a>
A Windows NT4 BDC can be promoted to a PDC. If the PDC is online at the time that a BDC is promoted to PDC,
the previous PDC is automatically demoted to a BDC. With Samba-3, this is not an automatic operation; the PDC
and BDC must be manually configured, and other appropriate changes also need to be made.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329025"></a>
With MS Windows NT4, a decision is made at installation to determine what type of machine the server will be.
It is possible to promote a BDC to a PDC, and vice versa. The only method Microsoft provide to convert a
Windows NT4 domain controller to a domain member server or a standalone server is to reinstall it. The install
time choices offered are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Primary Domain Controller</em></span>  the one that seeds the domain SAM.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Backup Domain Controller</em></span>  one that obtains a copy of the domain SAM.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Domain Member Server</em></span>  one that has no copy of the domain SAM; rather

<a class="indexterm" name="id329088"></a>

Samba-3 servers can readily be converted to and from domain controller roles through simple changes to the
<code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file. Samba-3 is capable of acting fully as a native member of a Windows 200x server Active
Directory domain.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329135"></a>
For the sake of providing a complete picture, MS Windows 2000 domain control configuration is done after the server has been
installed. Please refer to Microsoft documentation for the procedures that should be followed to convert a
domain member server to or from a domain control, and to install or remove active directory service support.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329150"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329159"></a>
New to Samba-3 is the ability to function fully as an MS Windows NT4-style domain controller,
excluding the SAM replication components. However, please be aware that Samba-3 also supports the
MS Windows 200x domain control protocols.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329173"></a>
At this time any appearance that Samba-3 is capable of acting as a <span class="emphasis"><em>domain controller</em></span> in
native ADS mode is limited and experimental in nature.  This functionality should not be used until the Samba
Team offers formal support for it.  At such a time, the documentation will be revised to duly reflect all
configuration and management requirements. Samba can act as a NT4-style domain controller in a Windows 2000/XP
environment. However, there are certain compromises:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>No machine policy files.</p></li><li><p>No Group Policy Objects.</p></li><li><p>No synchronously executed Active Directory logon scripts.</p></li><li><p>Can't use Active Directory management tools to manage users and machines.</p></li><li><p>Registry changes tattoo the main registry, while with Active Directory they do not leave

<a class="indexterm" name="id329231"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329237"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329244"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329251"></a>
There are two ways that MS Windows machines may interact with each other, with other servers,
and with domain controllers: either as <span class="emphasis"><em>standalone</em></span> systems, more commonly
called <span class="emphasis"><em>workgroup</em></span> members, or as full participants in a security system,
more commonly called <span class="emphasis"><em>domain</em></span> members.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329274"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329281"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329290"></a>
It should be noted that workgroup membership involves no special configuration other than the machine being
configured so the network configuration has a commonly used name for its workgroup entry. It is not uncommon
for the name WORKGROUP to be used for this. With this mode of configuration, there are no Machine Trust
Accounts, and any concept of membership as such is limited to the fact that all machines appear in the network
neighborhood to be logically grouped together. Again, just to be clear: <span class="emphasis"><em>workgroup mode does not
involve security machine accounts</em></span>.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329308"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329315"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329324"></a>
Domain member machines have a machine trust account in the domain accounts database. A special procedure
must be followed on each machine to effect domain membership. This procedure, which can be done
only by the local machine Administrator account, creates the domain machine account (if it does
not exist), and then initializes that account. When the client first logs onto the
domain, a machine trust account password change will be automatically triggered.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329339"></a>
When Samba is configured as a domain controller, secure network operation demands that
all MS Windows NT4/200x/XP Professional clients should be configured as domain members.
If a machine is not made a member of the domain, then it will operate like a workgroup
(standalone) machine. Please refer to <a href="domain-member.html" title="Chapter 6. Domain Membership">Domain Membership</a>, for
information regarding domain membership.

A domain controller is an SMB/CIFS server that:

	<a class="indexterm" name="id329534"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id329542"></a>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id329556"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id329563"></a>
	Registers and advertises itself as a domain controller (through NetBIOS broadcasts
	as well as by way of name registrations either by Mailslot Broadcasts over UDP broadcast,
	to a WINS server over UDP unicast, or via DNS and Active Directory).
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id329576"></a>

	Provides the NETLOGON service. (This is actually a collection of services that runs over
	multiple protocols. These include the LanMan logon service, the Netlogon service,
	the Local Security Account service, and variations of them.)
	</p></li><li><p>
	Provides a share called NETLOGON.

<a class="indexterm" name="id329630"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id329637"></a>
It is rather easy to configure Samba to provide these. Each Samba domain controller must provide the NETLOGON
service that Samba calls the <a class="indexterm" name="id329645"></a>domain logons functionality (after the name of the
parameter in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file). Additionally, one server in a Samba-3 domain must advertise itself as the
domain master browser.<sup>[<a name="id329659" href="#ftn.id329659">3</a>]</sup> This causes the PDC to claim a domain-specific NetBIOS name that identifies
it as a DMB for its given domain or workgroup. Local master browsers (LMBs) in the same domain or workgroup on
broadcast-isolated subnets then ask for a complete copy of the browse list for the whole wide-area network.
Browser clients then contact their LMB, and will receive the domain-wide browse list instead of just the list
for their broadcast-isolated subnet.

To be sure, Samba-3 is designed to provide most of the functionality that Microsoft Windows NT4-style
domain controllers have. Samba-3 does not have all the capabilities of Windows NT4, but it does have
a number of features that Windows NT4 domain controllers do not have. In short, Samba-3 is not NT4 and it
is not Windows Server 200x: it is not an Active Directory server. We hope this is plain and simple
enough for all to understand.

The subject of network or domain logons is discussed here because it forms
an integral part of the essential functionality that is provided by a domain controller.

All domain controllers must run the netlogon service (<span class="emphasis"><em>domain logons</em></span>
in Samba). One domain controller must be configured with <a class="indexterm" name="id330510"></a>domain master = Yes

To be completely clear: If you want MS Windows XP Home Edition to integrate with your
MS Windows NT4 or Active Directory domain security, understand it cannot be done.
The only option is to purchase the upgrade from MS Windows XP Home Edition to
MS Windows XP Professional.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
MS Windows XP Home Edition does not have the ability to join any type of domain
security facility. Unlike MS Windows 9x/Me, MS Windows XP Home Edition also completely
lacks the ability to log onto a network.
</p></div><p>
Now that this has been said, please do not ask the mailing list or email any of the
Samba Team members with your questions asking how to make this work. It can't be done.
If it can be done, then to do so would violate your software license agreement with
Microsoft, and we recommend that you do not do that.

A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same in terms of network
browsing. The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network. Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server. Samba-3 does this
now in the same way as MS Windows NT/200x.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id330721"></a>
The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is identical and
is explained in this documentation under the browsing discussions.
It should be noted that browsing is totally orthogonal to logon support.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id330737"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id330744"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id330750"></a>
Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
section. Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts, and user
profiles for MS Windows for Workgroups and MS Windows 9x/Me clients,
which are the focus of this section.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id330763"></a>
When an SMB client in a domain wishes to log on, it broadcasts requests for a logon server. The first one to
reply gets the job and validates its password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but ill advised) to create a domain where the user database is not shared between servers;
that is, they are effectively workgroup servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain. This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely involved with domains.
</p><p>
Using these features, you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server, make clients run a batch file when they log on to
the network and download their preferences, desktop, and start menu.
</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>
MS Windows XP Home edition is not able to join a domain and does not permit the use of domain logons.
</em></span></p><p>
Before launching into the configuration instructions, it is worthwhile to look at how a Windows 9x/Me client
performs a logon:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330801"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330807"></a>
	The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
	a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS name DOMAIN&lt;1C&gt; at the
	NetBIOS layer. The client chooses the first response it receives, which
	contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
	<code class="filename">\\SERVER</code>. The <code class="literal">1C</code> name is the name
	type that is registered by domain controllers (SMB/CIFS servers that provide
	the netlogon service).
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330841"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330847"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330854"></a>
	The client connects to that server, logs on (does an SMBsessetupX) and
	then connects to the IPC$ share (using an SMBtconX).
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330869"></a>
	The client does a NetWkstaUserLogon request, which retrieves the name
	of the user's logon script. 
	</p></li><li><p>
	The client then connects to the NetLogon share and searches for said script.	
	If it is found and can be read, it is retrieved and executed by the client.
	After this, the client disconnects from the NetLogon share.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330891"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330898"></a>
	The client sends a NetUserGetInfo request to the server to retrieve
	the user's home share, which is used to search for profiles. Since the
	response to the NetUserGetInfo request does not contain much more than	
	the user's home share, profiles for Windows 9x clients must reside in the user
	home directory.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330914"></a>
	The client connects to the user's home share and searches for the 
	user's profile. As it turns out, you can specify the user's home share as
	a share name and path. For example, <code class="filename">\\server\fred\.winprofile</code>.
	If the profiles are found, they are implemented.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330935"></a>
	The client then disconnects from the user's home share and reconnects to
	the NetLogon share and looks for <code class="filename">CONFIG.POL</code>, the policies file. If this is
	found, it is read and implemented.
	</p></li></ol></div><p>
The main difference between a PDC and a Windows 9x/Me logon server configuration is:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330962"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330971"></a>
	Password encryption is not required for a Windows 9x/Me logon server. But note
	that beginning with MS Windows 98 the default setting is that plaintext
	password support is disabled. It can be re-enabled with the registry
	changes that are documented in <a href="PolicyMgmt.html" title="Chapter 26. System and Account Policies">System and Account Policies</a>.
	</p></li><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id330992"></a>
	Windows 9x/Me clients do not require and do not use Machine Trust Accounts.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331003"></a>
A Samba PDC will act as a Windows 9x/Me logon server; after all, it does provide the
network logon services that MS Windows 9x/Me expect to find.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331016"></a>
Use of plaintext passwords is strongly discouraged. Where used they are easily detected
using a sniffer tool to examine network traffic.
</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id331027"></a>Security Mode and Master Browsers</h3></div></div></div><p>

<a class="indexterm" name="id331048"></a>
There are a few comments to make in order to tie up some loose ends. There has been much debate over the issue
of whether it is okay to configure Samba as a domain controller that operates with security mode other than
user-mode. The only security mode that will not work due to technical reasons is share-mode security. Domain
and server mode security are really just a variation on SMB user-level security.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331062"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331069"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331076"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331082"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331089"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331095"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331102"></a>
Actually, this issue is also closely tied to the debate on whether Samba must be the DMB for its workgroup
when operating as a domain controller.  In a pure Microsoft Windows NT domain, the PDC wins the election to be
the DMB, and then registers the DOMAIN&lt;1B&gt; NetBIOS name. This is not the name used by Windows clients
to locate the domain controller, all domain controllers register the DOMAIN&lt;1C&gt; name and Windows clients
locate a network logon server by seraching for the DOMAIN&lt;1C&gt; name.  A DMB is a Domain Master Browser
 see <a href="NetworkBrowsing.html" title="Chapter 10. Network Browsing">The Network Browsing Chapter</a>, <a href="NetworkBrowsing.html#DMB" title="Configuring Workgroup Browsing">Configuring WORKGROUP Browsing</a>; Microsoft PDCs expect to win the election to become the
DMB, if it loses that election it will report a continuous and rapid sequence of warning messages to its
Windows event logger complaining that it has lost the election to become a DMB.  For this reason, in networks
where a Samba server is the PDC it is wise to configure the Samba domain controller as the DMB.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331143"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331149"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331156"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331163"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331170"></a>
SMB/CIFS servers that register the DOMAIN&lt;1C&gt; name do so because they provide the network logon
service. Server that register the DOMAIN&lt;1B&gt; name are DMBs  meaning that they are responsible
for browse list synchronization across all machines that have registered the DOMAIN&lt;1D&gt; name. The later
are LMBs that have the responsibility to listen to all NetBIOS name registrations that occur locally to their
own network segment. The network logon service (NETLOGON) is germane to domain control and has nothing to do
with network browsing and browse list management. The 1C and 1B/1D name services are orthogonal to each
other.
</p></div><p>
Now back to the issue of configuring a Samba domain controller to use a mode other than <a class="indexterm" name="id331201"></a>security = user. If a Samba host is configured to use another SMB server or domain
controller in order to validate user connection requests, it is a fact that some other machine on the network
(the <a class="indexterm" name="id331209"></a>password server) knows more about the user than the Samba host. About 99 percent
of the time, this other host is a domain controller. Now to operate in domain mode security, the
<a class="indexterm" name="id331218"></a>workgroup parameter must be set to the name of the Windows NT domain (which already
has a domain controller).  If the domain does not already have a domain controller, you do not yet have a
domain.
</p><p>
Configuring a Samba box as a domain controller for a domain that already by definition has a
PDC is asking for trouble. Therefore, you should always configure the Samba domain controller
to be the DMB for its domain and set <a class="indexterm" name="id331231"></a>security = user.
This is the only officially supported mode of operation.

A machine account, typically stored in <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, takes the form of the machine
name with a &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221; appended. Some BSD systems will not create a user with a &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221; in the name.
Recent versions of FreeBSD have removed this limitation, but older releases are still in common use.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331296"></a>
The problem is only in the program used to make the entry. Once made, it works perfectly.  Create a user
without the &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221;. Then use <code class="literal">vipw</code> to edit the entry, adding the &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221;.
Or create the whole entry with vipw if you like; make sure you use a unique user login ID.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The machine account must have the exact name that the workstation has.</p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
The UNIX tool <code class="literal">vipw</code> is a common tool for directly editing the <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> file.
The use of vipw will ensure that shadow files (where used) will remain current with the passwd file. This is
important for security reasons.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id331343"></a>Joining Domain Fails Because of Existing Machine Account</h3></div></div></div><p>

&#8220;<span class="quote">I get told, `You already have a connection to the Domain....' or `Cannot join domain, the
credentials supplied conflict with an existing set...' when creating a Machine Trust Account.</span>&#8221;
</p><p>
This happens if you try to create a Machine Trust Account from the machine itself and already have a
connection (e.g., mapped drive) to a share (or IPC$) on the Samba PDC. The following command will remove all
network drive connections:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">C:\&gt; </code><strong class="userinput"><code>net use * /d</code></strong>
</pre><p>
This will break all network connections.
</p><p>
Further, if the machine is already a &#8220;<span class="quote">member of a workgroup</span>&#8221; that is the same name as the domain
you are joining (bad idea), you will get this message. Change the workgroup name to something else 
it does not matter what  reboot, and try again.

<span class="errorname">`The system cannot log you on (C000019B). Please try again or consult your system

</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id331419"></a>
This occurs when the domain SID stored in the secrets.tdb database is changed. The most common cause of a
change in domain SID is when the domain name and/or the server name (NetBIOS name) is changed.  The only way
to correct the problem is to restore the original domain SID or remove the domain client from the domain and
rejoin. The domain SID may be reset using either the net or rpcclient utilities.
</p><p>
To reset or change the domain SID you can use the net command as follows:

</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code><strong class="userinput"><code>net getlocalsid 'OLDNAME'</code></strong>
<code class="prompt">root# </code><strong class="userinput"><code>net setlocalsid 'SID'</code></strong>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Workstation Machine Trust Accounts work only with the domain (or network) SID. If this SID changes,
domain members (workstations) will not be able to log onto the domain. The original domain SID
can be recovered from the secrets.tdb file. The alternative is to visit each workstation to rejoin
it to the domain.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id331468"></a>The Machine Trust Account Is Not Accessible</h3></div></div></div><p>
&#8220;<span class="quote">When I try to join the domain I get the message, <span class="errorname">"The machine account 
for this computer either does not exist or is not accessible</span>." What's wrong?</span>&#8221;
</p><p>
This problem is caused by the PDC not having a suitable Machine Trust Account.  If you are using the
<a class="indexterm" name="id331488"></a>add machine script method to create accounts, then this would indicate that it has not
worked. Ensure the domain admin user system is working.
</p><p>
Alternately, if you are creating account entries manually, then they have not been created correctly. Make
sure that you have the entry correct for the Machine Trust Account in <code class="filename">smbpasswd</code> file on
the Samba PDC.  If you added the account using an editor rather than using the smbpasswd utility, make sure
that the account name is the machine NetBIOS name with a &#8220;<span class="quote">$</span>&#8221; appended to it (i.e.,
computer_name$). There must be an entry in both the POSIX UNIX system account backend as well as in the
SambaSAMAccount backend. The default backend for Samba-3 (i.e., the parameter <em class="parameter"><code>passdb
backend</code></em> is not specified in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file, or if specified is set to
<code class="literal">smbpasswd</code>, are respectively the <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> and
<code class="filename">/etc/samba/smbpasswd</code> (or <code class="filename">/usr/local/samba/lib/private/smbpasswd</code> if
compiled using Samba Team default settings). The use of the <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> can be overridden
by alternative settings in the NSS <code class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> file.
</p><p>
Some people have also reported that inconsistent subnet masks between the Samba server and the NT 
client can cause this problem.  Make sure that these are consistent for both client and server.

After successfully joining the domain, user logons fail with one of two messages: one to the
effect that the domain controller cannot be found; the other claims that the account does not
exist in the domain or that the password is incorrect. This may be due to incompatible
settings between the Windows client and the Samba-3 server for <span class="emphasis"><em>schannel</em></span>
(secure channel) settings or <span class="emphasis"><em>smb signing</em></span> settings. Check your Samba
settings for <span class="emphasis"><em>client schannel</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>server schannel</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>client signing</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>server signing</em></span> by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">testparm -v | grep channel</code> and looking for the value of these parameters.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Also use the MMC  Local Security Settings. This tool is available from the
Control Panel. The Policy settings are found in the Local Policies/Security Options area and are prefixed by
<span class="emphasis"><em>Secure Channel:..., and Digitally sign...</em></span>.
</p><p>
It is important that these be set consistently with the Samba-3 server settings.
