	The <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file is a configuration  file for the Samba suite. <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> contains  runtime configuration information for the Samba programs. The
	 <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file is designed to be configured and administered by the
	 <a href="swat.8.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">swat</span>(8)</span></a> program. The
	complete description of the file format and possible parameters held within are here for reference purposes.
	</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="FILEFORMATSECT"></a><h2>FILE FORMAT</h2><p>
	The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets
	and continues until the next section begins. Sections contain parameters of the form:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em> = <em class="replaceable"><code>value </code></em>
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or
	a parameter.
	</p><p>Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.</p><p>
	Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant.  Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is
	discarded.  Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant. Leading
	and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is
	retained verbatim.
	</p><p>
	Any line beginning with a semicolon (&#8220;<span class="quote">;</span>&#8221;) or a hash (&#8220;<span class="quote">#</span>&#8221;) 
	character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.
	</p><p>
	Any line ending in a &#8220;<span class="quote"><code class="literal">\</code></span>&#8221; is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion.
	</p><p>
	The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean,
	which may be given as yes/no, 0/1 or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved
	in string values. Some items such as create masks are numeric.
	</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id259596"></a><h2>SECTION DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p>
	Each section in the configuration file (except for the [global] section) describes a shared resource (known as
	a &#8220;<span class="quote">share</span>&#8221;). The section name is the name of the shared resource and the parameters within the
	section define the shares attributes.
	</p><p>
	There are three special sections, [global], [homes] and [printers], which are described under
	 <span class="emphasis"><em>special sections</em></span>. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions.
	</p><p>
	A share consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights
	which are granted to the user of the service. Some housekeeping options are also specifiable.
	</p><p>
	Sections are either file share services (used by the client as an extension of their native file systems)
	or printable services (used by the client to access print services on the host running the server).
	</p><p>
	Sections may be designated <span class="emphasis"><em>guest</em></span> services, in which case no password is required to
	access them. A specified UNIX <span class="emphasis"><em>guest account</em></span> is used to define access privileges in this
	case.
	</p><p>
	Sections other than guest services will require a password to access them. The client provides the
	username. As older clients only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list of usernames to
	check against the password using the <code class="literal">user =</code> option in the share definition. For modern clients
	such as Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary.
	</p><p>
	The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest
	UNIX user by the host system. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants.
	</p><p>
	The following sample section defines a file space share.  The user has write access to the path <code class="filename">/home/bar</code>.  The share is accessed via the share name <code class="literal">foo</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
	<em class="parameter"><code>[foo]</code></em>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id259433"></a>path = /home/bar
	<a class="indexterm" name="id260355"></a>read only = no
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	The following sample section defines a printable share.  The share is read-only, but printable. That is,
	the only write access permitted is via calls to open, write to and close a spool file. The <span class="emphasis"><em>guest
	ok</em></span> parameter means access will be permitted as the default guest user (specified elsewhere):
</p><pre class="programlisting">
	<em class="parameter"><code>[aprinter]</code></em>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id260383"></a>path = /usr/spool/public
	<a class="indexterm" name="id260390"></a>read only = yes
	<a class="indexterm" name="id260397"></a>printable = yes
	<a class="indexterm" name="id260404"></a>guest ok = yes
</pre><p>
	</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id260415"></a><h2>SPECIAL SECTIONS</h2><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="id260420"></a><h3>The [global] section</h3><p>
		Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole, or are defaults for sections that do not
		specifically define certain items. See the notes under PARAMETERS for more information.
		</p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="HOMESECT"></a><h3>The [homes] section</h3><p>
		If a section called [homes] is included in the configuration file, services connecting clients
		to their home directories can be created on the fly by the server.
		</p><p>
		When the connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is
		used. If no match is found, the requested section name is treated as a username and looked up in the local
		password file. If the name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is created by cloning the
		[homes] section.
		</p><p>
		Some modifications are then made to the newly created share:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
			The share name is changed from homes to the located username.
			</p></li><li><p>
			If no path was given, the path is set to the user's home directory.
			</p></li></ul></div><p>
		If you decide to use a <span class="emphasis"><em>path =</em></span> line in your [homes] section, it may be useful 
		to use the %S macro. For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="userinput"><code>path = /data/pchome/%S</code></strong>
</pre><p>
		is useful if you have different home directories for your PCs than for UNIX access.
		</p><p>
		This is a fast and simple way to give a large number of clients access to their home directories with a minimum 
		of fuss.
		</p><p>
		A similar process occurs if the requested section name is &#8220;<span class="quote">homes</span>&#8221;, except that the share
		name is not changed to that of the requesting user. This method of using the [homes] section works well if
		different users share a client PC.
		</p><p>
		The [homes] section can specify all the parameters a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense 
		than others. The following is a typical and suitable [homes] section:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<em class="parameter"><code>[homes]</code></em>
<a class="indexterm" name="id260157"></a>read only = no
</pre><p>
		</p><p>
		An important point is that if guest access is specified in the [homes] section, all home directories will be 
		visible to all clients <span class="emphasis"><em>without a password</em></span>.  In the very unlikely event that this is actually
		desirable, it is wise to also specify <span class="emphasis"><em>read only access</em></span>.
		</p><p>
		The <span class="emphasis"><em>browseable</em></span> flag for auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable 
		flag, not the [homes] browseable flag. This is useful as it means setting <span class="emphasis"><em>browseable = no</em></span> in
		the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make any auto home directories visible.
		</p></div><div class="refsect2" lang="en"><a name="PRINTERSSECT"></a><h3>The [printers] section</h3><p>
		This section works like [homes], but for printers.
		</p><p>
		If a [printers] section occurs in the configuration file, users are able to connect to any printer 
		specified in the local host's printcap file.
		</p><p>
		When a connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned. If a match is found, it is used.
		If no match is found, but a [homes] section exists, it is used as described above. Otherwise, the requested
		section name is treated as a printer name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see if the requested
		section name is a valid printer share name. If a match is found, a new printer share is created by cloning the
		[printers] section.
		</p><p>
		A few modifications are then made to the newly created share:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The share name is set to the located printer name</p></li><li><p>If no printer name was given, the printer name is set to the located printer name</p></li><li><p>If the share does not permit guest access and no username was given, the username is set
				to the located printer name.</p></li></ul></div><p>
		The [printers] service MUST be printable - if you specify otherwise, the server will refuse 
		to load the configuration file.
		</p><p>
		Typically the path specified is that of a world-writeable spool directory with the sticky bit set on 
		it. A typical [printers] entry looks like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<em class="parameter"><code>[printers]</code></em>
<a class="indexterm" name="id300481"></a>path = /usr/spool/public
<a class="indexterm" name="id300488"></a>guest ok = yes
<a class="indexterm" name="id300495"></a>printable = yes
</pre><p>
		</p><p>
		All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file are legitimate printer names as far as the server is concerned. 
		If your printing subsystem doesn't work like that, you will have to set up a pseudo-printcap. This is a file
		consisting of one or more lines like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
alias|alias|alias|alias...    
</pre><p>
		</p><p>
		Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for your printing subsystem. In the [global] section,
		specify the new file as your printcap.  The server will only recognize names found in your pseudo-printcap,
		which of course can contain whatever aliases you like. The same technique could be used simply to limit access
		to a subset of your local printers.
		</p><p>
		An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the first entry of a printcap record. Records are separated by newlines,
		components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical bar symbols (<code class="literal">|</code>).
		</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
		On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what printers are defined on the system you may be able to use
		<code class="literal">printcap name = lpstat</code> to automatically obtain a list of printers. See the
		<code class="literal">printcap name</code> option for more details.

	</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id300798"></a><h2>VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS</h2><p>
	Many of the strings that are settable in the config file can take substitutions. For example the option
	&#8220;<span class="quote">path = /tmp/%u</span>&#8221; is interpreted as &#8220;<span class="quote">path = /tmp/john</span>&#8221; if the user connected with the
	username john.
	</p><p>
	These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, but there are some general substitutions

	There are some quite creative things that can be done with these substitutions and other
	<code class="filename">smb.conf</code> options.
	</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="NAMEMANGLINGSECT"></a><h2>NAME MANGLING</h2><p>
	Samba supports <code class="literal">name mangling</code> so that DOS and Windows clients can use files that don't
	conform to the 8.3 format. It can also be set to adjust the case of 8.3 format filenames.
	</p><p>
	There are several options that control the way mangling is performed, and they are grouped here rather
	than listed separately. For the defaults look at the output of the testparm program.
	</p><p>
	These options can be set separately for each service.
	</p><p>
	The options are:

		controls whether filenames are case sensitive. If they aren't, Samba must do a filename search and match on
		passed names. The default setting of auto allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS
		and smbclient 3.0.5 and above currently) to tell the Samba server on a per-packet basis that they wish to
		access the file system in a case-sensitive manner (to support UNIX case sensitive semantics). No Windows or

		<a class="indexterm" name="id301253"></a>short preserve case = No are set.  This change is needed as part of the

	By default, Samba 3.0 has the same semantics as a Windows NT server, in that it is case insensitive

	There are a number of ways in which a user can connect to a service. The server uses the following steps

    from a Windows client. If a Windows client doesn't have permissions to delete a file then they
    expect this to be denied at open time. POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by
    actually attempting to delete the file or directory. As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a
    delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately
    on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file. With this parameter set to
    true (the default) then smbd checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the
    request without actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it.
    This is not perfect, as it's possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to
    check the permissions correctly, but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct
    behaviour. Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case.
    </p><p>If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn't check permissions on "open for delete"
    and allows the open. If the user doesn't have permission to delete the file this will only be
    discovered at close time, which is too late for the Windows user tools to display an error message
    to the user. The symptom of this is files that appear to have been deleted "magically" re-appearing
    on a Windows explorer refersh. This is an extremely advanced protocol option which should not
    need to be changed. This parameter was introduced in its final form in 3.0.21, an earlier version
    with slightly different semantics was introduced in 3.0.20. That older version is not documented here.

	</p><p>
	On a Windows server, groups may be the owner of a file or directory - thus allowing anyone in

	on a point in the filesystem to the group owner of a directory and anything below it also owned
	by that group. This means there are multiple people with permissions to modify ACLs on a file
	or directory, easing managability.
	</p><p>
	This parameter allows Samba to also permit delegation of the control over a point in the exported

    When smbd is serving Printer Drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients, each printer on the Samba
    server has a Device Mode which defines things such as paper size and
    orientation and duplex settings.  The device mode can only correctly be
    generated by the printer driver itself (which can only be executed on a
    Win32 platform).  Because smbd is unable to execute the driver code
    to generate the device mode, the default behavior is to set this field
    to NULL.
    </p><p>Most problems with serving printer drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients
    can be traced to a problem with the generated device mode.  Certain drivers
    will do things such as crashing the client's Explorer.exe with a NULL devmode.
    However, other printer drivers can cause the client's spooler service
    (spoolsv.exe) to die if the devmode was not created by the driver itself
    (i.e. smbd generates a default devmode).
    </p><p>This parameter should be used with care and tested with the printer
    driver in question.  It is better to leave the device mode to NULL
    and let the Windows client set the correct values.  Because drivers do not
    do this all the time, setting <code class="literal">default devmode = yes</code>
    will instruct smbd to generate a default one.

    If this parameter is set, a Windows NT ACL that contains an unknown SID (security descriptor, or 
    representation of a user or group id) as the owner or group owner of the file will be silently
    mapped into the current UNIX uid or gid of the currently connected user.
    </p><p>
    This is designed to allow Windows NT clients to copy files and folders containing ACLs that were 
    created locally on the client machine and contain users local to that machine only (no domain
    users) to be copied to a Samba server (usually with XCOPY /O) and have the unknown userid and 
    groupid of the file owner map to the current connected user.  This can only be fixed correctly
    when winbindd allows arbitrary mapping from any Windows NT SID to a UNIX uid or gid.

	By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the Unix-style NSS subsystem to
	access user and group information. Due to the way Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group
	this inevitably leads to inefficiencies. One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he
	is member of. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS
	counterparts in LDAP. UNIX has optimized functions to enumerate group membership. Sadly, other functions that
	are used to deal with user and group attributes lack such optimization.
	</p><p>
	To make Samba scale well in large environments, the <a class="indexterm" name="id312581"></a>ldapsam:trusted = yes
	option assumes that the complete user and group database that is relevant to Samba is stored in LDAP with the
	standard posixAccount/posixGroup attributes. It further assumes that the Samba auxiliary object classes are

	<a class="indexterm" name="id312590"></a>ldapsam:trusted = yes can be activated and Samba can bypass the

	This parameter can be used with Win9X workstations to ensure that roaming profiles are stored in a

	<code class="literal">logon home = \\%N\%U\profile</code>

	This tells Samba to return the above string, with substitutions made when a client requests the info, generally

  	 <code class="literal">net use /home</code> but use the whole string when dealing with profiles.

	This parameter specifies the directory where roaming profiles (Desktop, NTuser.dat, etc) are

	<a class="indexterm" name="id313953"></a>logon home parameter.

	This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have separate logon scripts for each user or

	folders, and their contents, are loaded and displayed on your Windows NT client.
	</p><p>
	The share and the path must be readable by the user for the preferences and directories to be loaded onto the
	Windows NT client. The share must be writeable when the user logs in for the first time, in order that the
	Windows NT client can create the NTuser.dat and other directories.  
	Thereafter, the directories and any of the contents can, if required, be made read-only.  It is not advisable
	that the NTuser.dat file be made read-only - rename it to NTuser.man to achieve the desired effect (a
	<span class="emphasis"><em>MAN</em></span>datory profile).
	</p><p>
	Windows clients can sometimes maintain a connection to the [homes] share, even though there is no user logged
	in.  Therefore, it is vital that the logon path does not include a reference to the homes share (i.e. setting
	this parameter to \\%N\homes\profile_path will cause problems).

	over-ride the parameter value present in the smb.conf file. Any error
	present in the passdb backend account record must be editted using the

	Disable the use of roaming profiles by setting the value of this parameter to the empty string. For

	of all reported files and directories to be BUILTIN\\Administrators,
	BUILTIN\\Users respectively (SIDs S-1-5-32-544, S-1-5-32-545). Secondly
	it adds an ACE entry of "Full Control" to the SID BUILTIN\\Users to
	every returned ACL. This will allow any Windows 2000 or XP workstation
	user to access the profile.
	</p><p>
	Note that if you have multiple users logging

	each others profiles you must remove the "Bypass traverse checking" advanced
	user right. This will prevent access to other users profile directories as
	the top level profile directory (named after the user) is created by the

</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><a name="USERNAMEMAP"></a>username map (G)</span></dt><dd><p>
	This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server.
	This can be used for several purposes. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows
	machines to those that the UNIX box uses. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they
	can more easily share files.
	</p><p>
	Please note that for user or share mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user
	credentials.  Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been
	successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified enties in the map table (e.g.
	biddle = DOMAIN\foo).
	</p><p>
	The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a '='
	followed by a list of usernames on the right. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form
	@group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group. The special client name '*' is a
	wildcard and matches any name. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long.
	</p><p>
	The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the
	right hand side of the '=' signs. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it
	is replaced with the name on the left. Processing then continues with the next line.
	</p><p>
	If any line begins with a '#' or a ';' then it is ignored.
	</p><p>
	If any line begins with an '!' then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the
	line.  Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed.  Using '!' is most useful when you have a
	wildcard mapping line later in the file.
	</p><p>
	For example to map from the name <code class="constant">admin</code> or <code class="constant">administrator</code> to the UNIX
	name <code class="constant"> root</code> you would use:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="literal">root = admin administrator</code>
</pre><p>
	Or to map anyone in the UNIX group <code class="constant">system</code> to the UNIX name <code class="constant">sys</code> you would use:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="literal">sys = @system</code>
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file.
	</p><p>
	If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup database is checked before the <code class="filename">/etc/group </code> database for matching groups.
	</p><p>
	You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double quotes around the name. For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="literal">tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"</code>
</pre><p>
    would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username "tridge".
	</p><p>
	The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest. Note the use of the
    '!' to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
!sys = mary fred
guest = *
</pre><p>
    </p><p>
	Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames.  Thus if you connect to \\server\fred and
	<code class="constant">fred</code> is remapped to <code class="constant">mary</code> then you will actually be connecting to
	\\server\mary and will need to supply a password suitable for <code class="constant">mary</code> not
	<code class="constant">fred</code>. The only exception to this is the username passed to the <a class="indexterm" name="id326373"></a>password server (if you have one). The password server will receive whatever username the client
	supplies without  modification.
    </p><p>
	Also note that no reverse mapping is done. The main effect this has is with printing. Users who have been
	mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don't own the print
	job.
	</p><p>
	Samba versions prior to 3.0.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e.g.: DOMAIN\user) from
	the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client.  However, when looking up a map entry for a
	user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be used for matches.  This resulted in inconsistent
	behavior sometimes even on the same server.
   </p><p>
   The following functionality is obeyed in version 3.0.8 and later:
   </p><p>
    When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate
    the connection.
    </p><p>
    When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map
    to the fully qualified username (i.e. DOMAIN\user) only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
    </p><p>
