	in text mode. It is similar to the "Network Neighborhood" found 
	on Windows computers. It prints a tree with all 
	the known domains, the servers in those domains and 
	the shares on the servers.

configuration details required by the server.  The 
information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well 
as descriptions of all the services that the server is 
to provide. See <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> for more information.
The default configuration file name is determined at 
compile time.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-d|--debuglevel=level</span></dt><dd><p><em class="replaceable"><code>level</code></em> is an integer 
from 0 to 10.  The default value if this parameter is 
not specified is zero.</p><p>The higher this value, the more detail will be 
logged to the log files about the activities of the 
server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious 
warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of 
information about operations carried out.</p><p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable 
amounts of log data, and should only be used when 
investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for 
use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.</p><p>Note that specifying this parameter here will 
override the <a class="indexterm" name="id259405"></a> parameter
in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-l|--logfile=logdirectory</span></dt><dd><p>Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension
<code class="constant">".progname"</code> will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, 
log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-N</span></dt><dd><p>If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal
password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when
accessing a service that does not require a password. </p><p>Unless a password is specified on the command line or
this parameter is specified, the client will request a
password.</p><p>If a password is specified on the command line and this
option is also defined the password on the command line will
be silently ingnored and no password will be used.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-k</span></dt><dd><p>

an Active Directory environment.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-A|--authentication-file=filename</span></dt><dd><p>This option allows
you to specify a file from which to read the username and

client will first check the <code class="envar">USER</code> environment variable, then the
<code class="envar">LOGNAME</code> variable and if either exists, the
string is uppercased. If these environmental variables are not
found, the username <code class="constant">GUEST</code> is used. </p><p>A third option is to use a credentials file which
contains the plaintext of the username and password.  This
option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not
wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment
variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions
on the file restrict access from unwanted users.  See the
<em class="parameter"><code>-A</code></em> for more details. </p><p>Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on
many systems the command line of a running process may be seen
via the <code class="literal">ps</code> command.  To be safe always allow
<code class="literal">rpcclient</code> to prompt for a password and type
it in directly. </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-h|--help</span></dt><dd><p>Print a summary of command line options.
