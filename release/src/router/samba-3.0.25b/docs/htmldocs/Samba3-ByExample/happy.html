	In the world of computer networks, problems are as varied as the people who create them
	or experience them. The design of the network implemented in <a href="Big500users.html" title="Chapter 4. The 500-User Office">???</a>
	may create problems for some network users. The following lists some of the problems that
	may occur:
	</p><a class="indexterm" name="id335700"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id335707"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id335716"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id335722"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id335729"></a><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3><p>
A significant number of network administrators have responded to the guidance given
here. It should be noted that there are sites that have a single PDC for many hundreds of
concurrent network clients. Network bandwidth, network bandwidth utilization, and server load
are among the factors that determine the maximum number of Windows clients that
can be served by a single domain controller (PDC or BDC) on a network segment. It is possible
to operate with only a single PDC over a routed network. What is possible is not necessarily
<span class="emphasis"><em>best practice</em></span>. When Windows client network logons begin to fail with
the message that the domain controller cannot be found or that the user account cannot
be found (when you know it exists), that may be an indication that the domain controller is
overloaded or network bandwidth is overloaded. The guidance given for PDC/BDC ratio to Windows
clients is conservative and if followed will minimize problems  but it is not absolute.
</p></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Users experiencing difficulty logging onto the network</span></dt><dd><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id335766"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id335775"></a>
		When a Windows client logs onto the network, many data packets are exchanged
		between the client and the server that is providing the network logon services.
		Each request between the client and the server must complete within a specific
		time limit. This is one of the primary factors that govern the installation of
		multiple domain controllers (usually called secondary or backup controllers).
		As a rough rule, there should be one such backup controller for every
		30 to 150 clients. The actual limits are determined by network operational
		characteristics. 
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id335790"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id335797"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id335803"></a>
		If the domain controller provides only network logon services
		and all file and print activity is handled by domain member servers, one domain	
		controller per 150 clients on a single network segment may suffice. In any
		case, it is highly recommended to have a minimum of one domain controller (PDC or BDC)
		per network segment. It is better to have at least one BDC on the network
		segment that has a PDC. If the domain controller is also used as a file and
		print server, the number of clients it can service reliably is reduced,
		and generally for low powered hardware should not exceed 30 machines (Windows 
		workstations plus domain member servers) per domain controller. Many sites are
		able to operate with more clients per domain controller, the number of clients
		that can be supported is limited by the CPU speed, memory and the workload on
		the Samba server as well as network bandwidth utilization.

		<a class="indexterm" name="id335837"></a>
		Slow logons and log-offs may be caused by many factors that include:

			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335850"></a>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335861"></a>
				Excessive delays in the resolution of a NetBIOS name to its IP
				address. This may be observed when an overloaded domain controller 
				is also the WINS server. Another cause may be the failure to use
				a WINS server (this assumes that there is a single network segment).
				</p></li><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335877"></a>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335884"></a>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335890"></a>
				Network traffic collisions due to overloading of the network
				segment. One short-term workaround to this may be to replace
				network HUBs with Ethernet switches.
				</p></li><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335903"></a>
				Defective networking hardware. Over the past few years, we have seen
				on the Samba mailing list a significant increase in the number of
				problems that were traced to a defective network interface controller,
				a defective HUB or Ethernet switch, or defective cabling. In most cases,
				it was the erratic nature of the problem that ultimately pointed to
				the cause of the problem.
				</p></li><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335920"></a>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335929"></a>
				Excessively large roaming profiles. This type of problem is typically
				the result of poor user education as well as poor network management.
				It can be avoided by users not storing huge quantities of email in
				MS Outlook PST files as well as by not storing files on the desktop.
				These are old bad habits that require much discipline and vigilance
				on the part of network management.
				</p></li><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335946"></a>
				You should verify that the Windows XP WebClient service is not running.
				The use of the WebClient service has been implicated in many Windows
				networking-related problems.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Loss of access to network drives and printer resources</span></dt><dd><p>
		Loss of access to network resources during client operation may be caused by a number
		of factors, including:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335976"></a>
				Network overload (typically indicated by a high network collision rate)
				</p></li><li><p>
				Server overload
				</p></li><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id335995"></a>
				Timeout causing the client to close a connection that is in use but has

				</p></li><li><p>
				<a class="indexterm" name="id336009"></a>
				Defective networking hardware
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id336023"></a>
		No matter what the cause, a sudden loss of access to network resources can
		result in BSOD (blue screen of death) situations that necessitate rebooting of the client
		workstation. In the case of a mild problem, retrying to access the network drive of the printer
		may restore operations, but in any case this is a serious problem that may lead to the next
		problem, data corruption.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Potential data corruption</span></dt><dd><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id336047"></a>
		Data corruption is one of the most serious problems. It leads to uncertainty, anger, and 
		frustration, and generally precipitates immediate corrective demands. Management response
		to this type of problem may be rational, as well as highly irrational. There have been
		cases where management has fired network staff for permitting this situation to occur without 
		immediate correction. There have been situations where perfectly functional hardware was thrown 
		out and replaced, only to find the problem caused by a low-cost network hardware item. There 
		have been cases where server operating systems were replaced, or where Samba was updated, 
		only to later isolate the problem due to defective client software.

	In this chapter, you can work through a number of measures that significantly arm you to
	anticipate and combat network performance issues. You can work through complex and thorny
	methods to improve the reliability of your network environment, but be warned that all such steps
	demand the price of complexity.
	</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id336072"></a>Regarding LDAP Directories and Windows Computer Accounts</h2></div></div></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336080"></a>
	Computer (machine) accounts can be placed wherever you like in an LDAP directory subject to some 
	constraints that are described in this section.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336094"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336100"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336107"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336114"></a>
	The POSIX and SambaSAMAccount components of computer (machine) accounts are both used by Samba. 
	That is, machine  accounts are treated inside Samba in the same way that Windows NT4/200X treats 
	them. A user account and a machine account are indistinguishable from each other, except that
	the machine account ends in a $ character, as do trust accounts.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336127"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336134"></a>
	The need for Windows user, group, machine, trust, and other such accounts to be tied to a valid UNIX UID
	is a design decision that was made a long way back in the history of Samba development. It is 
	unlikely that this decision will be reversed or changed during the remaining life of the 
	Samba-3.x series. 
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336146"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336153"></a>
	The resolution of a UID from the Windows SID is achieved within Samba through a mechanism that
	must refer back to the host operating system on which Samba is running. The name service
	switch (NSS) is the preferred mechanism that shields applications (like Samba) from the
	need to know everything about every host OS it runs on.
	</p><p>
	Samba asks the host OS to provide a UID via the &#8220;<span class="quote">passwd</span>&#8221;, &#8220;<span class="quote">shadow</span>&#8221;
	and &#8220;<span class="quote">group</span>&#8221; facilities in the NSS control (configuration) file. The best tool
	for achieving this is left up to the UNIX administrator to determine. It is not imposed by
	Samba. Samba provides winbindd together with its support libraries as one method. It is
	possible to do this via LDAP, and for that Samba provides the appropriate hooks so that
	all account entities can be located in an LDAP directory.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336184"></a>
	For many the weapon of choice is to use the PADL nss_ldap utility. This utility must
	be configured so that computer accounts can be resolved to a POSIX/UNIX account UID. That
	is fundamentally an LDAP design question.  The information provided on the Samba list and
	in the documentation is directed at providing working examples only. The design
	of an LDAP directory is a complex subject that is beyond the scope of this documentation.

	Good morning,
	</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>
	A few months ago we sat down to design the network. We discussed the challenges ahead and we all
	agreed to compromise our design to keep it simple. We knew there would be problems, but anticipated
	that we would have some time to resolve any issues that might be encountered.
	</p><p>
	As you now know, we started off on the wrong foot. We have a lot of unhappy users. One of them
	resigned yesterday afternoon because she was under duress to complete some critical projects. She
	suffered a blue screen of death situation just as she was finishing four hours of intensive work, all
	of which was lost. She has a unique requirement that involves storing large files on her desktop.
	Mary's desktop profile is nearly 1 GB in size. As a result of her desktop configuration, it
	takes her nearly 15 minutes just to log onto her workstation. But that is not enough. Because all
	network logon traffic passes over the network links between our buildings, logging on may take
	three or four attempts due to blue screen problems associated with network timeouts.
	</p><p>
	A few of us worked to help her out of trouble. We convinced her to stay and promised to fully 
	resolve the difficulties she is facing. We have no choice. We must implement LDAP and set hard 
	limits on what our users can do with their desktops. Otherwise, we face staff losses 
	that can surely do harm to our growth as well as to staff morale. I am sure we can better deal 
	with the consequences of what we know we must do than we can with the unrest we have now.
	</p><p>
	Stan and I have discussed the current situation. We are resolved to help our users and protect
	the well being of Abmas. Please acknowledge this advice with consent to proceed as required to
	regain control of our vital IT operations.

	The implementation of Samba BDCs necessitates the installation and configuration of LDAP.
	For this site, you use OpenLDAP, the open source software LDAP server platform. Commercial
	LDAP servers in current use with Samba-3 include:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id336437"></a>
		Novell <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/edirectory/" target="_top">eDirectory</a>
		is being successfully used by some sites. Information on how to use eDirectory can be
		obtained from the Samba mailing lists or from Novell.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id336455"></a>
		IBM <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/directory-server/" target="_top">Tivoli 
		Directory Server</a> can be used to provide the Samba LDAP backend. Example schema 
		files are provided in the Samba source code tarball under the directory 
		<code class="filename">~samba/example/LDAP.</code>
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id336480"></a>
		Sun <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/software/products/identity_srvr/home_identity.xml" target="_top">ONE Identity 
		Server product suite</a> provides an LDAP server that can be used for Samba.
		Example schema files are provided in the Samba source code tarball under the directory
		<code class="filename">~samba/example/LDAP.</code>
		</p></li></ul></div><p>
	A word of caution is fully in order. OpenLDAP is purely an LDAP server, and unlike commercial
	offerings, it requires that you manually edit the server configuration files and manually
	initialize the LDAP directory database. OpenLDAP itself has only command-line tools to
	help you to get OpenLDAP and Samba-3 running as required, albeit with some learning curve challenges.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336511"></a>
	For most sites, the deployment of Microsoft Active Directory from the shrink-wrapped installation is quite
	adequate. If you are migrating from Microsoft Active Directory, be warned that OpenLDAP does not include
	GUI-based directory management tools. Even a simple task such as adding users to the OpenLDAP database 
	requires an understanding of what you are doing, why you are doing it, and the tools that you must use.

	When installed and configured, an OpenLDAP Identity Management backend for Samba functions well. 
	High availability operation may be obtained through directory replication/synchronization and 
	master/slave server configurations. OpenLDAP is a mature platform to host the organizational 
	directory infrastructure that can include all UNIX accounts, directories for electronic mail, and much more. 
	The price paid through learning how to design an LDAP directory schema in implementation and configuration 
	of management tools is well rewarded by performance and flexibility and the freedom to manage directory
	contents with greater ability to back up, restore, and modify the directory than is generally possible
	with Microsoft Active Directory.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id336608"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336615"></a>
	A comparison of OpenLDAP with Microsoft Active Directory does not do justice to either. OpenLDAP is an LDAP directory
	tool-set. Microsoft Active Directory Server is an implementation of an LDAP server that is largely preconfigured
	for a specific task orientation. It comes with a set of administrative tools that is entirely customized
	for the purpose of running MS Windows applications that include file and print services, Microsoft Exchange
	server, Microsoft SQL server, and more. The complexity of OpenLDAP is highly valued by the UNIX administrator
	who wants to build a custom directory solution. Microsoft provides an application called 
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/adam/default.mspx" target="_top">
	MS ADAM</a> that provides more generic LDAP services, yet it does not have the vanilla-like services
	of OpenLDAP.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336638"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336647"></a>
	You may wish to consider outsourcing the development of your OpenLDAP directory to an expert, particularly
	if you find the challenge of learning about LDAP directories, schemas, configuration, and management
	tools and the creation of shell and Perl scripts a bit
	challenging. OpenLDAP can be easily customized, though it includes
	many ready-to-use schemas. Samba-3 provides an OpenLDAP schema file
	that is required for use as a passdb backend.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336661"></a>
	For those who are willing to brave the process of installing and configuring LDAP and Samba-3 interoperability,
	there are a few nice Web-based tools that may help you to manage your users and groups more effectively.
	The Web-based tools you might like to consider include the
	<a href="http://lam.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">LDAP Account Manager</a> (LAM) and the Webmin-based
	<a href="http://www.webmin.com" target="_top">Webmin</a> Idealx

	Mary's problems are due to two factors. First, the absence of a domain controller on the local network is the
	main cause of the errors that result in blue screen crashes. Second, Mary has a large profile that must
	be loaded over the WAN connection. The addition of BDCs on each network segment significantly
	improves overall network performance for most users, but it is not enough. You must gain control over
	user desktops, and this must be done in a way that wins their support and does not cause further loss of
	staff morale. The following procedures solve this problem.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id336786"></a>
	There is also an opportunity to implement smart printing features. You add this to the Samba configuration
	so that future printer changes can be managed without need to change desktop configurations.
	</p><p>
	You add the ability to automatically download new printer drivers, even if they are not installed 
	in the default desktop profile. Only one example of printing configuration is given. It is assumed that
	you can extrapolate the principles and use them to install all printers that may be needed.

	The solution provided is a minimal approach to getting OpenLDAP running as an identity management directory
	server for UNIX system accounts as well as for Samba. From the OpenLDAP perspective, UNIX system
	accounts are stored POSIX schema extensions. Samba provides its own schema to permit storage of account 
	attributes Samba needs. Samba-3 can use the LDAP backend to store:

	<a class="indexterm" name="id336920"></a>
	The use of LDAP with Samba-3 makes it necessary to store UNIX accounts as well as Windows Networking
	accounts in the LDAP backend. This implies the need to use the 
	<a href="http://www.padl.com/Contents/OpenSourceSoftware.html" target="_top">PADL LDAP tools</a>. The resolution 
	of the UNIX group name to its GID must be enabled from either the <code class="filename">/etc/group</code> 
	or from the LDAP backend. This requires the use of the PADL <code class="filename">nss_ldap</code> tool-set
	that integrates with the NSS. The same requirements exist for resolution
	of the UNIX username to the UID. The relationships are demonstrated in <a href="happy.html#sbehap-LDAPdiag" title="Figure 5.1. The Interaction of LDAP, UNIX Posix Accounts and Samba Accounts">???</a>.

	You configure OpenLDAP so that it is operational. Before deploying the OpenLDAP, you really
	ought to learn how to configure secure communications over LDAP so that site security is not
	at risk. This is not covered in the following guidance.

	When OpenLDAP has been made operative, you configure the PDC called <code class="constant">MASSIVE</code>.
	You initialize the Samba <code class="filename">secrets.tdb<sub></sub></code> file. Then you
	create the LDAP Interchange Format (LDIF) file from which the LDAP database can be initialized.
	You need to decide how best to create user and group accounts. A few hints are, of course, provided.
	You can also find on the enclosed CD-ROM, in the <code class="filename">Chap06</code> directory, a few tools
	that help to manage user and group configuration.

	In order to effect folder redirection and to add robustness to the implementation,

	when the user logs off.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id337100"></a>
	The profile is configured so that users cannot change the appearance

		As XP roaming profiles grow, so does the amount of time it takes to log in and out.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337291"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337298"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337305"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337311"></a>
		An XP roaming profile consists of the <code class="constant">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> hive file
		<code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code> and a number of folders (My Documents, Application Data,
		Desktop, Start Menu, Templates, NetHood, Favorites, and so on).  When a user logs onto the 
		network with the default configuration of MS Windows NT/200x/XPP, all this data is 
		copied to the local machine under the <code class="filename">C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%</code>
		directory. While the user is logged in, any changes made to any of these folders or to the
		<code class="constant">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> branch of the registry are made to the local copy
		of the profile.  At logout the profile data is copied back to the server. This behavior
		can be changed through appropriate registry changes and/or through changes to the default
		user profile. In the latter case, it updates the registry with the values that are set in the
		profile <code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code>
		file.
		</p><p>
		The first challenge is to reduce the amount of data that must be transferred to and 
		from the profile server as roaming profiles are processed.  This includes removing 
		all the shortcuts in the Recent directory, making sure the cache used by the Web browser 
		is not being dumped into the <code class="filename">Application Data</code> folder, removing the 
		Java plug-ins cache (the .jpi_cache directory in the profile), as well as training the 
		user to not place large files on the desktop and to use his or her mapped home directory
		instead of the <code class="filename">My Documents</code> folder for saving documents.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337373"></a>
		Using a folder other than <code class="filename">My Documents</code> is a nuisance for 
		some users, since many applications use it by default.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337390"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337396"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337403"></a>
		The secret to rapid loading of roaming profiles is to prevent unnecessary data from 
		being copied back and forth, without losing any functionality. This is not difficult; 
		it can be done by making changes to the Local Group Policy on each client as well 
		as changing some paths in each user's <code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code> hive.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337422"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337429"></a>
		Every user profile has its own <code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code> file. This means
		you need to edit every user's profile, unless a better method can be
		followed. Fortunately, with the right preparations, this is not difficult.
		It is possible to remove the <code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code> file from each
		user's profile. Then just create a Network Default Profile. Of course, it is
		necessary to copy all files from redirected folders to the network share to which
		they are redirected.

		&#8220;<span class="quote">Local Settings; Temporary Internet Files; History; Temp</span>&#8221;.
		</p><p>
		Simply add the folders you do not wish to be copied back and forth to this

		</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id337546"></a>Profile Changes</h4></div></div></div><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337554"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337561"></a>
		There are two changes that should be done to each user's profile. Move each of 
		the directories that you have excluded from being copied back and forth out of 
		the usual profile path. Modify each user's <code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code> file 
		to point to the new paths that are shared over the network instead of to the default
		path (<code class="filename">C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%</code>).
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337586"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337592"></a>
		The above modifies existing user profiles. So that newly created profiles have 
		these settings, you need to modify the <code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code> in 
		the <code class="filename">C:\Documents and Settings\Default User</code> folder on each 
		client machine, changing the same registry keys.  You could do this by copying 
		<code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code> to a Linux box and using <code class="literal">regedt32</code>.
		The basic method is described under <a href="happy.html#redirfold" title="Configuration of Default Profile with Folder Redirection">???</a>.

		<a class="indexterm" name="id337643"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337649"></a>
		If you are using Samba as your PDC, you should create a file share called 
		<code class="constant">NETLOGON</code> and within that create a directory called 
		<code class="filename">Default User</code>, which is a copy of the desired default user 
		configuration (including a copy of <code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code>).
		If this share exists and the <code class="filename">Default User</code> folder exists, 
		the first login from a new account pulls its configuration from it.

		The subject of printing is quite topical. Printing problems run second place to name
		resolution issues today. So far in this book, you have experienced only what is generally
		known as &#8220;<span class="quote">dumb</span>&#8221; printing. Dumb printing is the arrangement by which all drivers
		are manually installed on each client and the printing subsystems perform no filtering
		or intelligent processing. Dumb printing is easily understood. It usually works without
		many problems, but it has its limitations also. Dumb printing is better known as
		<code class="literal">Raw-Print-Through</code> printing.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337737"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337746"></a>
		Samba permits the configuration of <code class="literal">smart</code> printing using the Microsoft
		Windows point-and-click (also called drag-and-drop) printing. What this provides is
		essentially the ability to print to any printer. If the local client does not yet have a
		driver installed, the driver is automatically downloaded from the Samba server and
		installed on the client. Drag-and-drop printing is neat; it means the user never needs
		to fuss with driver installation, and that is a <span class="trademark">Good Thing,</span>&#8482;
		isn't it?
		</p><p>
		There is a further layer of print job processing that is known as <code class="literal">intelligent</code>
		printing that automatically senses the file format of data submitted for printing and
		then invokes a suitable print filter to convert the incoming data stream into a format
		suited to the printer to which the job is dispatched.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337786"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337793"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id337800"></a>
		The CUPS printing subsystem is capable of intelligent printing. It has the capacity to
		detect the data format and apply a print filter. This means that it is feasible to install
		on all Windows clients a single printer driver for use with all printers that are routed
		through CUPS. The most sensible driver to use is one for a PostScript printer. Fortunately,
		<a href="http://www.easysw.com" target="_top">Easy Software Products</a>, the authors of CUPS, have
		released a PostScript printing driver for Windows. It can be installed into the Samba
		printing backend so that it automatically downloads to the client when needed. 
		</p><p>
		This means that so long as there is a CUPS driver for the printer, all printing from Windows 
		software can use PostScript, no matter what the actual printer language for the physical 
		device is. It also means that the administrator can swap out a printer with a totally 
		different type of device without ever needing to change a client workstation driver.
		</p><p>
		This book is about Samba-3, so you can confine the printing style to just the smart
		style of installation. Those interested in further information regarding intelligent
		printing should review documentation on the Easy Software Products Web site.

	It is feasible to comment out the <code class="constant">passwd</code> and <code class="constant">group</code>
	entries so they will not be cached. Alternatively, it is often simpler to just disable the
	<code class="literal">nscd</code> service by executing (on Novell SUSE Linux):
</p><pre class="screen">

		<a class="indexterm" name="id338034"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id338041"></a>
		In the example <code class="filename">/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</code> control file
		(see <a href="happy.html#sbehap-dbconf" title="Example 5.1. LDAP DB_CONFIG File">???</a>) there is an entry for <code class="constant">loglevel	256</code>.

		LDAP log information can be directed into a file that is separate from the normal system
		log files by changing the <code class="filename">/etc/syslog.conf</code> file so it has the following
		contents:
</p><pre class="screen">
# Some foreign boot scripts require local7
#
local0,local1.*                 -/var/log/localmessages
local2,local3.*                 -/var/log/localmessages
local5.*                        -/var/log/localmessages
local6,local7.*                 -/var/log/localmessages
local4.*                        -/var/log/ldaplogs
</pre><p>
		In this case, all LDAP-related logs will be directed to the file
		<code class="filename">/var/log/ldaplogs</code>. This makes it easy to track LDAP errors.
		The snippet provides a simple example of usage that can be modified to suit
		local site needs. The configuration used later in this chapter reflects such
		customization with the intent that LDAP log files will be stored at a location
		that meets local site needs and wishes more fully.
		</p></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id338115"></a>Debugging NSS_LDAP</h5></div></div></div><p>
		The basic mechanism for diagnosing problems with the nss_ldap utility involves adding to the
		<code class="filename">/etc/ldap.conf</code> file the following parameters:
</p><pre class="screen">
debug 256
logdir /data/logs
</pre><p>
		Create the log directory as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> mkdir /data/logs
</pre><p>
		</p><p>
		The diagnostic process should follow these steps:
		</p><div class="procedure"><a name="id338155"></a><p class="title"><b>Procedure 5.1. NSS_LDAP Diagnostic Steps</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>
			Verify the <code class="constant">nss_base_passwd, nss_base_shadow, nss_base_group</code> entries
			in the <code class="filename">/etc/ldap.conf</code> file and compare them closely with the directory
			tree location that was chosen when the directory was first created.
			</p><p>
			One way this can be done is by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> slapcat | grep Group | grep dn
dn: ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
dn: cn=Domain Admins,ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
dn: cn=Domain Users,ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
dn: cn=Domain Guests,ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
dn: cn=Domain Computers,ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
dn: cn=Administrators,ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
dn: cn=Print Operators,ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
dn: cn=Backup Operators,ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
dn: cn=Replicators,ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz
</pre><p>
			The first line is the DIT entry point for the container for POSIX groups. The correct entry
			for the <code class="filename">/etc/ldap.conf</code> for the <code class="constant">nss_base_group</code>
			parameter therefore is the distinguished name (dn) as applied here:
</p><pre class="screen">
nss_base_group ou=Groups,dc=abmas,dc=biz?one
</pre><p>
			The same process may be followed to determine the appropriate dn for user accounts.
			If the container for computer accounts is not the same as that for users (see the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code>
			file entry for <code class="constant">ldap machine suffix</code>), it may be necessary to set the 
			following DIT dn in the <code class="filename">/etc/ldap.conf</code> file:
</p><pre class="screen">
nss_base_passwd dc=abmas,dc=biz?sub
</pre><p>
			This instructs LDAP to search for machine as well as user entries from the top of the DIT
			down. This is inefficient, but at least should work. Note: It is possible to specify multiple
			<code class="constant">nss_base_passwd</code> entries in the <code class="filename">/etc/ldap.conf</code> file; they
			will be evaluated sequentially. Let us consider an example of use where the following DIT
			has been implemented:
			</p><p>
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>User accounts are stored under the DIT: ou=Users, dc=abmas, dc=biz</p></li><li><p>User login accounts are under the DIT: ou=People, ou-Users, dc=abmas, dc=biz</p></li><li><p>Computer accounts are under the DIT: ou=Computers, ou=Users, dc=abmas, dc=biz</p></li></ul></div><p>
			</p><p>
			The appropriate multiple entry for the <code class="constant">nss_base_passwd</code> directive
			in the <code class="filename">/etc/ldap.conf</code> file may be:
</p><pre class="screen">
nss_base_passwd ou=People,ou=Users,dc=abmas,dc=org?one
nss_base_passwd ou=Computers,ou=Users,dc=abmas,dc=org?one
</pre><p>
			</p></li><li><p>
			Perform lookups such as:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> getent passwd
</pre><p>
			Each such lookup will create an entry in the <code class="filename">/data/log</code> directory
			for each such process executed. The contents of each file created in this directory
			may provide a hint as to the cause of the a problem that is under investigation. 
			</p></li><li><p>
			For additional diagnostic information, check the contents of the <code class="filename">/var/log/messages</code>
			to see what error messages are being generated as a result of the LDAP lookups. Here is an example of
			a successful lookup:
</p><pre class="screen">

	Since you have chosen to put UNIX user and group accounts into the LDAP database, it is likely
	that you may want to use them for UNIX system (Linux) local machine logons. This necessitates
	correct configuration of PAM. The <code class="literal">pam_ldap</code> open source package provides the

	module also has the ability to redirect authentication requests through LDAP.

	You have chosen to configure these services by directly editing the system files, but of course, you

	SUSE Linux has a facility in YaST (the system admin tool) through <span class="guimenu">yast</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">system</span> &#8594; <span class="guimenuitem">ldap-client</span> that permits

</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> strings /lib/libnss_ldap.so.2 | grep conf

		On the servers called <code class="constant">BLDG1</code> and <code class="constant">BLDG2</code>, install the file shown in

		Edit the NSS control file (<code class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>) so that the lines that
		control user and group resolution will obtain information from the normal system files as
		well as from <code class="literal">ldap</code>:
</p><pre class="screen">
passwd: files ldap
shadow: files ldap
group:  files ldap
hosts:  files dns wins
</pre><p>
		Later, when the LDAP database has been initialized and user and group accounts have been
		added, you can validate resolution of the LDAP resolver process. The inclusion of 
		WINS-based hostname resolution is deliberate so that all MS Windows client hostnames can be 
		resolved to their IP addresses, whether or not they are DHCP clients.
		</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
		Some Linux systems (Novell SUSE Linux in particular) add entries to the <code class="filename">nsswitch.conf</code>
		file that may cause operational problems with the configuration methods adopted in this book. It is
		advisable to comment out the entries <code class="constant">passwd_compat</code> and <code class="constant">group_compat</code>
		where they are found in this file.
		</p></div><p>
		Even at the risk of overstating the issue, incorrect and inappropriate configuration of the
		<code class="filename">nsswitch.conf</code> file is a significant cause of operational problems with LDAP.

		For PAM LDAP configuration on this SUSE Linux 9.0 system, the simplest solution is to edit the following
		files in the <code class="filename">/etc/pam.d</code> directory: <code class="literal">login</code>, <code class="literal">password</code>,
		<code class="literal">samba</code>, <code class="literal">sshd</code>.  In each file, locate every entry that has the
		<code class="literal">pam_unix2.so</code> entry and add to the line the entry <code class="literal">use_ldap</code> as shown
		for the <code class="literal">login</code> module in this example:
</p><pre class="screen">
#%PAM-1.0
auth      requisite  pam_unix2.so   nullok use_ldap #set_secrpc
auth      required   pam_securetty.so

#auth     required   pam_homecheck.so
auth      required   pam_env.so
auth      required   pam_mail.so
account   required   pam_unix2.so   use_ldap
password  required   pam_pwcheck.s  nullok
password  required   pam_unix2.so   nullok use_first_pass \
                                    use_authtok use_ldap

session   required   pam_limits.so
</pre><p>
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id339609"></a>
		On other Linux systems that do not have an LDAP-enabled <code class="literal">pam_unix2.so</code> module,
		you must edit these files by adding the <code class="literal">pam_ldap.so</code> modules as shown here:
</p><pre class="screen">
#%PAM-1.0
auth     required    pam_securetty.so
auth     required    pam_nologin.so
auth     sufficient  pam_ldap.so
auth     required    pam_unix2.so   nullok try_first_pass #set_secrpc
account  sufficient  pam_ldap.so
account  required    pam_unix2.so
password required    pam_pwcheck.so nullok
password required    pam_ldap.so    use_first_pass use_authtok
password required    pam_unix2.so   nullok use_first_pass use_authtok
session  required    pam_unix2.so   none # debug or trace
session  required    pam_limits.so
session  required    pam_env.so
session  optional    pam_mail.so
</pre><p>
		This example does have the LDAP-enabled <code class="literal">pam_unix2.so</code>, but simply
		demonstrates the use of the <code class="literal">pam_ldap.so</code> module. You can use either
		implementation, but if the <code class="literal">pam_unix2.so</code> on your system supports
		LDAP, you probably want to use it rather than add an additional module.

		Samba-3 communicates with the LDAP server. The password that it uses to
		authenticate to the LDAP server must be stored in the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code>
		file. Execute the following to create the new <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> files
		and store the password for the LDAP Manager:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> smbpasswd -w not24get
</pre><p>

</p><pre class="screen">

		<a class="indexterm" name="id339908"></a>
		Samba-3 generates a Windows Security Identifier (SID) only when <code class="literal">smbd</code>
		has been started. For this reason, you start Samba. After a few seconds delay,
		execute:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> smbclient -L localhost -U%
<code class="prompt">root# </code> net getlocalsid
</pre><p>
		A report such as the following means that the domain SID has not yet
		been written to the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> or to the LDAP backend:
</p><pre class="screen">
[2005/03/03 23:19:34, 0] lib/smbldap.c:smbldap_connect_system(852)
  failed to bind to server ldap://massive.abmas.biz
with dn="cn=Manager,dc=abmas,dc=biz" Error: Can't contact LDAP server
        (unknown)
[2005/03/03 23:19:48, 0] lib/smbldap.c:smbldap_search_suffix(1169)
  smbldap_search_suffix: Problem during the LDAP search:
        (unknown) (Timed out)
</pre><p>
		The attempt to read the SID will cause and attempted bind to the LDAP server. Because the LDAP server
		is not running, this operation will fail by way of a timeout, as shown previously. This is
		normal output; do not worry about this error message.  When the domain has been created and
		written to the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file, the output should look like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
SID for domain MASSIVE is: S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765
</pre><p>
		If, after a short delay (a few seconds), the domain SID has still not been written to 
		the <code class="filename">secrets.tdb</code> file, it is necessary to investigate what 
		may be misconfigured. In this case, carefully check the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file for typographical 
		errors (the most common problem).  The use of the <code class="literal">testparm</code> is highly 
		recommended to validate the contents of this file.
		</p></li><li><p>
		When a positive domain SID has been reported, stop Samba.

		Configure the NFS server for your Linux system. So you can complete the steps that
		follow, enter into the <code class="filename">/etc/exports</code> the following entry:
</p><pre class="screen">
/home   *(rw,root_squash,sync)
</pre><p>
		This permits the user home directories to be used on the BDC servers for testing
		purposes. You, of course, decide what is the best way for your site to distribute
		data drives, and you create suitable backup and restore procedures for Abmas
		I'd strongly recommend that for normal operation the BDC is completely independent 
		of the PDC. rsync is a useful tool here, as it resembles the NT replication service quite 
		closely. If you do use NFS, do not forget to start the NFS server as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> rcnfsserver start

	The LDAP database must be populated with well-known Windows domain user accounts and domain group 
	accounts before Samba can be used. The following procedures step you through the process.
	</p><p>
	At this time, Samba-3 requires that on a PDC all UNIX (POSIX) group accounts that are
	mapped (linked) to Windows domain group accounts must be in the LDAP database. It does not
	hurt to have UNIX user and group accounts in both the system files as well as in the LDAP
	database. From a UNIX system perspective, the NSS resolver checks system files before
	referring to LDAP. If the UNIX system can resolve (find) an account in the system file, it
	does not need to ask LDAP.
	</p><p>
	Addition of an account to the LDAP backend can be done in two ways:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id341352"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id341359"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id341365"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id341372"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id341379"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id341386"></a>
		If you always have a user account in the <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> on every 
		server or in a NIS(+) backend, it is not necessary to add POSIX accounts for them in 
		LDAP. In this case, you can add Windows domain user accounts using the 
		<code class="literal">pdbedit</code> utility. Use of this tool from the command line adds the 
		SambaSamAccount entry for the user, but does not add the PosixAccount entry for the user.
		</p><p>
		This is the least desirable method because when LDAP is used as the passwd backend Samba
		expects the POSIX account to be in LDAP also. It is possible to use the PADL account
		migration tool to migrate all system accounts from either the <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>
		files, or from NIS, to LDAP.
		</p></li><li><p>
		If you decide that it is probably a good idea to add both the PosixAccount attributes
		as well as the SambaSamAccount attributes for each user, then a suitable script is needed.
		In the example system you are installing in this exercise, you are making use of the
		Idealx smbldap-tools scripts. A copy of these tools, preconfigured for this system,
		is included on the enclosed CD-ROM under <code class="filename">Chap06/Tools.</code>
		</p></li></ul></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id341437"></a>
	If you wish to have more control over how the LDAP database is initialized or 
	if you don't want to use the Idealx smbldap-tools, you should refer to 
	<a href="appendix.html" title="Chapter 15. A Collection of Useful Tidbits">???</a>, <a href="appendix.html#altldapcfg" title="Alternative LDAP Database Initialization">???</a>.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id341463"></a>
	The following steps initialize the LDAP database, and then you can add user and group
	accounts that Samba can use. You use the <code class="literal">smbldap-populate</code> to
	seed the LDAP database. You then manually add the accounts shown in <a href="happy.html#sbehap-bigacct" title="Table 5.3. Abmas Network Users and Groups">???</a>. 
	The list of users does not cover all 500 network users; it provides examples only.
	</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id341489"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id341498"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id341508"></a>
	In the following examples, as the LDAP database is initialized, we do create a container
	for Computer (machine) accounts. In the Samba-3 <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> files, specific use is made
	of the People container, not the Computers container, for domain member accounts. This is not a
	mistake; it is a deliberate action that is necessitated by the fact that the resolution of 
	a machine (computer) account to a UID is done via NSS. The only way this can be handled is
	using the NSS (<code class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>) entry for <code class="constant">passwd</code>,
	which is resolved using the <code class="filename">nss_ldap</code> library. The configuration file for
	the <code class="filename">nss_ldap</code> library is the file <code class="filename">/etc/ldap.conf</code> that
	provides only one possible LDAP search command that is specified by the entry called
	<code class="constant">nss_base_passwd</code>. This means that the search path must take into account
	the directory structure so that the LDAP search will commence at a level that is above
	both the Computers container and the Users (or People) container. If this is done, it is
	necessary to use a search that will descend the directory tree so that the machine account
	can be found. Alternatively, by placing all machine accounts in the People container, we
	are able to sidestep this limitation. This is the simpler solution that has been adopted
	in this chapter.

		So that we can use a global IDMAP repository, the LDAP directory must have a container object for IDMAP data. 
		There are several ways you can check that your LDAP database is able to receive IDMAP information. One of 
		the simplest is to execute:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> slapcat | grep -i idmap
dn: ou=Idmap,dc=abmas,dc=biz
ou: idmap
</pre><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id341906"></a>
	        If the execution of this command does not return IDMAP entries, you need to create an LDIF
		template file (see <a href="happy.html#sbehap-ldifadd" title="Example 5.12. LDIF IDMAP Add-On Load File File: /etc/openldap/idmap.LDIF">???</a>). You can add the required entries using 
		the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=abmas,dc=biz" \
		-w not24get &lt; /etc/openldap/idmap.LDIF
</pre><p>
		Samba automatically populates this LDAP directory container when it needs to.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id341942"></a>
		It looks like all has gone well, as expected. Let's confirm that this is the case
		by running a few tests. First we check the contents of the database directly
		by running <code class="literal">slapcat</code> as follows (the output has been cut down):

		<a class="indexterm" name="id342158"></a>
		Now verify that the UNIX (POSIX) accounts can be resolved via NSS by executing the
		following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> getent passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/bin/bash
...
root:x:0:512:Netbios Domain Administrator:/home:/bin/false
nobody:x:999:514:nobody:/dev/null:/bin/false
bobj:x:1000:513:System User:/home/bobj:/bin/bash
stans:x:1001:513:System User:/home/stans:/bin/bash
chrisr:x:1002:513:System User:/home/chrisr:/bin/bash
maryv:x:1003:513:System User:/home/maryv:/bin/bash
</pre><p>
		This demonstrates that user account resolution via LDAP is working.
		</p></li><li><p>
		This step will determine whether or not identity resolution is working correctly.
		Do not procede is this step fails, rather find the cause of the failure. The
		<code class="literal">id</code> command may be used to validate your configuration so far,
		as shown here:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> id chrisr
uid=1002(chrisr) gid=513(Domain Users) groups=513(Domain Users)
</pre><p>
		This confirms that the UNIX (POSIX) user account information can be resolved from LDAP
		by system tools that make a getentpw() system call.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id342218"></a>
		The root account must have UID=0; if not, this means that operations conducted from
		a Windows client using tools such as the Domain User Manager fails under UNIX because
		the management of user and group accounts requires that the UID=0. Additionally, it is
		a good idea to make certain that no matter how root account credentials are resolved,
		the home directory and shell are valid. You decide to effect this immediately
		as demonstrated here:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> cd /opt/IDEALX/sbin
<code class="prompt">root# </code> ./smbldap-usermod -u 0 -d /root -s /bin/bash root
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p>
		Verify that the changes just made to the <code class="constant">root</code> account were
		accepted by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> getent passwd | grep root
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
root:x:0:512:Netbios Domain Administrator:/root:/bin/bash
</pre><p>
		This demonstrates that the changes were accepted.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Make certain that a home directory has been created for every user by listing the
		directories in <code class="filename">/home</code> as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> ls -al /home
drwxr-xr-x   8 root   root         176 Dec 17 18:50 ./
drwxr-xr-x  21 root   root         560 Dec 15 22:19 ../
drwx------   7 bobj   Domain Users     568 Dec 17 01:16 bobj/
drwx------   7 chrisr Domain Users     568 Dec 17 01:19 chrisr/
drwx------   7 maryv  Domain Users     568 Dec 17 01:27 maryv/
drwx------   7 stans  Domain Users     568 Dec 17 01:43 stans/
</pre><p>
		This is precisely what we want to see.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id342306"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id342312"></a>
		The final validation step involves making certain that Samba-3 can obtain the user
		accounts from the LDAP ldapsam passwd backend. Execute the following command as shown:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> pdbedit -Lv chrisr
Unix username:        chrisr
NT username:          chrisr

</pre><p>
		This looks good. Of course, you fully expected that it would all work, didn't you?
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id342355"></a>
		Now you add the group accounts that are used on the Abmas network. Execute
		the following exactly as shown:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> ./smbldap-groupadd -a Accounts
<code class="prompt">root# </code> ./smbldap-groupadd -a Finances
<code class="prompt">root# </code> ./smbldap-groupadd -a PIOps
</pre><p>
		The addition of groups does not involve keyboard interaction, so the lack of console
		output is of no concern.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id342394"></a>
		You really do want to confirm that UNIX group resolution from LDAP is functioning 
		as it should. Let's do this as shown here:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> getent group
...
Domain Admins:x:512:root
Domain Users:x:513:bobj,stans,chrisr,maryv
Domain Guests:x:514:
...
Accounts:x:1000:
Finances:x:1001:
PIOps:x:1002:
</pre><p>
		The well-known special accounts (Domain Admins, Domain Users, Domain Guests), as well
		as our own site-specific group accounts, are correctly listed. This is looking good.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id342423"></a>
		The final step we need to validate is that Samba can see all the Windows domain groups
		and that they are correctly mapped to the respective UNIX group account. To do this,
		just execute the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> net groupmap list
Domain Admins (S-1-5-21-3504140859-...-2431957765-512) -&gt; Domain Admins
Domain Users (S-1-5-21-3504140859-...-2431957765-513) -&gt; Domain Users
Domain Guests (S-1-5-21-3504140859-...-2431957765-514) -&gt; Domain Guests
...
Accounts (S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765-3001) -&gt; Accounts
Finances (S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765-3003) -&gt; Finances
PIOps (S-1-5-21-3504140859-1010554828-2431957765-3005) -&gt; PIOps
</pre><p>
		This is looking good. Congratulations  it works! Note that in the above output
		the lines were shortened by replacing the middle value (1010554828) of the SID with the 
		ellipsis (...).
		</p></li><li><p>
		The server you have so carefully built is now ready for another important step. You 
		start the Samba-3 server and validate its operation. Execute the following to render all 
		the processes needed fully operative so that, on system reboot, they are automatically 
		started:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chkconfig named on
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chkconfig dhcpd on
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chkconfig ldap on
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chkconfig nmb on
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chkconfig smb on
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chkconfig winbind on
<code class="prompt">root# </code> rcnmb start
<code class="prompt">root# </code> rcsmb start
<code class="prompt">root# </code> rcwinbind start
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p>
		The next step might seem a little odd at this point, but take note that you are about to
		start <code class="literal">winbindd</code>, which must be able to authenticate to the PDC via the
		localhost interface with the <code class="literal">smbd</code> process. This account can be
		easily created by joining the PDC to the domain by executing the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> net rpc join -S MASSIVE -U root%not24get
</pre><p>
		Note: Before executing this command on the PDC, both <code class="literal">nmbd</code> and
		<code class="literal">smbd</code> must be started so that the <code class="literal">net</code> command
		can communicate with <code class="literal">smbd</code>. The expected output is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
Joined domain MEGANET2.
</pre><p>
		This indicates that the domain security account for the PDC has been correctly created.
		</p></li><li><p>
		At this time it is necessary to restart <code class="literal">winbindd</code> so that it can
		correctly authenticate to the PDC. The following command achieves that:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> rcwinbind restart
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id342620"></a>
		You may now check Samba-3 operation as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">

                Create an entry in the DNS database on the server <code class="constant">MASSIVE</code>
                in both the forward lookup database for the zone <code class="constant">abmas.biz.hosts</code>
                and in the reverse lookup database for the network segment that the printer is to
                be located in. Example configuration files for similar zones were presented in <a href="secure.html" title="Chapter 3. Secure Office Networking">???</a>,

                Follow the instructions in the printer manufacturers' manuals to permit printing
                to port 9100.  Use any other port the manufacturer specifies for direct mode,
                raw printing.  This allows the CUPS spooler to print using raw mode protocols.
                <a class="indexterm" name="id342772"></a>
                <a class="indexterm" name="id342778"></a>

                <a class="indexterm" name="id342799"></a>
                Only on the server to which the printer is attached, configure the CUPS Print
                Queues as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> lpadmin -p <em class="parameter"><code>printque</code></em>
	 -v socket://<em class="parameter"><code>printer-name</code></em>.abmas.biz:9100 -E
</pre><p>
                <a class="indexterm" name="id342832"></a>
                This step creates the necessary print queue to use no assigned print filter. This
                is ideal for raw printing, that is, printing without use of filters.
                The name <em class="parameter"><code>printque</code></em> is the name you have assigned for
                the particular printer.
                </p></li><li><p>
                Print queues may not be enabled at creation. Make certain that the queues
                you have just created are enabled by executing the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> /usr/bin/enable <em class="parameter"><code>printque</code></em>
</pre><p>
                </p></li><li><p>
                Even though your print queue may be enabled, it is still possible that it
                may not accept print jobs. A print queue will service incoming printing
                requests only when configured to do so. Ensure that your print queue is
                set to accept incoming jobs by executing the following commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> /usr/bin/accept <em class="parameter"><code>printque</code></em>

		Now you must obtain the domain SID from the PDC and store it into the

		passdb backend because Samba-3 obtains the domain SID from the 
		sambaDomain object it automatically stores in the LDAP backend. It does not hurt to

		When configuring a Samba-3 BDC that has an LDAP backend, there is no need to take

		thus requiring that the BDC should be joined to the domain. The process of joining

                The server you have so carefully built is now ready for another important step. Now
                start the Samba-3 server and validate its operation. Execute the following to render all
                the processes needed fully operative so that, upon system reboot, they are automatically

		Your new <code class="constant">BLDG1, BLDG2</code> servers do not have home directories for users.
		To rectify this using the SUSE yast2 utility or by manually editing the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code>
		file, add a mount entry to mount the <code class="constant">home</code> directory that has been exported
		from the <code class="constant">MASSIVE</code> server. Mount this resource before proceeding. An alternate
		approach could be to create local home directories for users who are to use these machines.
		This is a choice that you, as system administrator, must make. The following entry in the
		<code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file suffices for now:
</p><pre class="screen">
massive.abmas.biz:/home  /home  nfs     rw 0 0
</pre><p>
		To mount this resource, execute:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> mount -a

</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> df | grep home

	The makings of a great network environment take a lot of effort and attention to detail.
	So far, you have completed most of the complex (and to many administrators, the interesting

	In your <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file, you have specified Windows shares. Each has a <em class="parameter"><code>path</code></em>
	parameter. Even though it is obvious to all, one of the common Samba networking problems is
	caused by forgetting to verify that every such share root directory actually exists and that it
	has the necessary permissions and ownership.

	user desktop profiles are now made up of two components: a dynamically loaded part and a set of file
	network folders.
	</p><p>
	For this arrangement to work, every user needs a directory structure for the network folder
	portion of his or her profile as shown here:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/profdata
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chown root:root /var/lib/samba/profdata
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chmod 755 /var/lib/samba/profdata

# Per user structure
<code class="prompt">root# </code> cd /var/lib/samba/profdata
<code class="prompt">root# </code> mkdir -p <span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
<code class="prompt">root# </code> for i in InternetFiles Cookies History AppData \
                      LocalSettings MyPictures MyDocuments Recent
<code class="prompt">root# </code> do
<code class="prompt">root# </code> mkdir <span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>/$i
<code class="prompt">root# </code> done
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chown -R <span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>:Domain\ Users <span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chmod -R 750 <span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id345294"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id345300"></a>
	You have three options insofar as the dynamically loaded portion of the roaming profile
	is concerned: 
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You may permit the user to obtain a default profile.</p></li><li><p>You can create a mandatory profile.</p></li><li><p>You can create a group profile (which is almost always a mandatory profile).</p></li></ul></div><p>
	Mandatory profiles cannot be overwritten by a user. The change from a user profile to a mandatory
	profile is effected by renaming the <code class="filename">NTUSER.DAT</code> to <code class="filename">NTUSER.MAN</code>,
	that is, just by changing the filename extension.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id345346"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id345353"></a>
	The location of the profile that a user can obtain is set in the user's account in the LDAP passdb backend.
	You can manage this using the Idealx smbldap-tools or using the 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/SRVTOOLS.EXE" target="_top">Windows NT4 Domain User Manager</a>.
	</p><p>
	It may not be obvious that you must ensure that the root directory for the user's profile exists
	and has the needed permissions. Use the following commands to create this directory:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/profiles/<span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chown <span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>:Domain\ Users
	    /var/lib/samba/profiles/<span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chmod 700  /var/lib/samba/profiles/<span class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
</pre><p>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id345420"></a>
	The use of a logon script with Windows XP Professional is an option that every site should consider.
	Unless you have locked down the desktop so the user cannot change anything, there is risk that
	a vital network drive setting may be broken or that printer connections may be lost. Logon scripts
	can help to restore persistent network folder (drive) and printer connections in a predictable
	manner. One situation in which such breakage may occur in particular is when a mobile PC (notebook)
	user attaches to another company's network that forces environment changes that are alien to your
	network.
	</p><p>
	If you decide to use network logon scripts, by reference to the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> files for the domain
	controllers, you see that the path to the share point for the <code class="constant">NETLOGON</code>
	share defined is <code class="filename">/var/lib/samba/netlogon</code>. The path defined for the logon
	script inside that share is <code class="filename">scripts\logon.bat</code>. This means that as a Windows
	NT/200x/XP client logs onto the network, it tries to obtain the file <code class="filename">logon.bat</code>
	from the fully qualified path <code class="filename">/var/lib/samba/netlogon/scripts</code>. This fully
	qualified path should therefore exist whether you install the <code class="filename">logon.bat</code>.
	</p><p>
	You can, of course, create the fully qualified path by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/netlogon/scripts
</pre><p>
	</p><p>
	You should research the options for logon script implementation by referring to <span class="emphasis"><em>TOSHARG2</em></span>, Chapter 24,
	Section 24.4. A quick Web search will bring up a host of options. One of the most popular logon
	facilities in use today is called <a href="http://www.kixtart.org" target="_top">KiXtart</a>.
	</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id345510"></a>Assigning User Rights and Privileges</h3></div></div></div><p>
	The ability to perform tasks such as joining Windows clients to the domain can be assigned to
	normal user accounts. By default, only the domain administrator account (<code class="constant">root</code> on UNIX
	systems because it has UID=0) can add accounts. New to Samba 3.0.11 is the ability to grant
	this privilege in a very limited fashion to particular accounts.
	</p><p>
	By default, even Samba-3.0.11 does not grant any rights even to the <code class="constant">Domain Admins</code>
	group. Here we grant this group all privileges.
	</p><p>
	Samba limits privileges on a per-server basis. This is a deliberate limitation so that users who
	are granted rights can be restricted to particular machines. It is left to the network administrator
	to determine which rights should be provided and to whom.

	Microsoft Outlook can store a Personal Storage file, generally known as a PST file.
	It is the nature of email storage that this file grows, at times quite rapidly.
	So that users' email is available to them at every workstation they may log onto,
	it is common practice in well-controlled sites to redirect the PST folder to the
	users' home directory. Follow these steps for each user who wishes to do this.
	</p><p>
	To redirect the Outlook PST file in Outlook 2003 (older versions of Outlook behave
	slightly differently), follow these steps:
	</p><div class="procedure"><a name="id346375"></a><p class="title"><b>Procedure 5.16. Outlook PST File Relocation</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>
		Close Outlook if it is open.
		</p></li><li><p>
		From the <span class="guimenu">Control Panel</span>, launch the Mail icon.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Click <span class="guimenu">Email Accounts.</span>
		</p></li><li><p>
		Make a note of the location of the PST file(s). From this location, move
		the files to the desired new target location. The most desired new target location 
		may well be the users' home directory.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Add a new data file, selecting the PST file in the new desired target location.
		Give this entry (not the filename) a new name such as &#8220;<span class="quote">Personal Mail Folders.</span>&#8221;
		</p><p>
		Note: If MS Outlook has been configured to use an IMAP account configuration there may be problems
		following these instructions. Feedback from users suggests that where IMAP is used the PST
		file is used to store rules and filters. When the PST store is relocated it appears to break
		MS Outlook's Send/Receive button. If anyone has sucessfully relocated PST files where IMAP is 
		used please email <code class="literal">jht@samba.org</code> with useful tips and suggestions so that

	Outlook Express is not at all like MS OutLook. It stores file very differently also. Outlook
	Express storage files can not be redirected to network shares. The options panel will not permit
	this, but they can be moved to folders outside of the user's profile. They can also be excluded
	from folder synchronization as part of the roaming profile.
	</p><p>
	While it is possible to redirect the data stores for Outlook Express data stores by editing the 
	registry, experience has shown that data corruption and loss of email messages will result.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id346545"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id346552"></a>
	In the same vane as MS Outlook, Outlook Express data stores can become very large. When used with
	roaming profiles this can result in excruciatingly long login and logout behavior will files are
	synchronized. For this reason, it is highly recommended not to use Outlook Express where roaming
	profiles are used.
	</p></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id346565"></a>
	Microsoft does not support storing PST files on network shares, although the practice does appear
	to be rather popular. Anyone who does relocation the PST file to a network resource should refer
	the Microsoft <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/297019/" target="_top">reference</a> to better
	understand the issues.

	Apart from manually moving PST files to a network share, it is possible to set the default PST

	Your network has both fixed desktop workstations as well as notebook computers. As a general rule, it is
	a good idea to not tamper with the operating system that is provided by the notebook computer manufacturer.
	Notebooks require special handling that is beyond the scope of this chapter.
	</p><p>
	For desktop systems, the installation of software onto administratively centralized application servers
	make a lot of sense. This means that you can manage software maintenance from a central
	perspective and that only minimal application stubware needs to be installed onto the desktop
	systems. You should proceed with software installation and default configuration as far as is humanly
	possible and so long as it makes sense to do so. Make certain to thoroughly test and validate every aspect
	of software operations and configuration.
	</p><p>
	When you believe that the overall configuration is complete, be sure to create a shared group profile
	and migrate that to the Samba server for later reuse when creating custom mandatory profiles, just in
	case a user may have specific needs you had not anticipated.

	This chapter introduced many new concepts. Is it a sad fact that the example presented deliberately
	avoided any consideration of security. Security does not just happen; you must design it into your total
	network. Security begins with a systems design and implementation that anticipates hostile behavior from
	users both inside and outside the organization. Hostile and malicious intruders do not respect barriers;
	they accept them as challenges. For that reason, if not simply from a desire to establish safe networking
	practices, you must not deploy the design presented in this book in an environment where there is risk
	of compromise.

	As a minimum, the LDAP server must be protected by way of Access Control Lists (ACLs), and it must be
	configured to use secure protocols for all communications over the network. Of course, secure networking
	does not result just from systems design and implementation but involves constant user education
	training and, above all, disciplined attention to detail and constant searching for signs of unfriendly
	or alien activities. Security is itself a topic for a whole book. Please do consult appropriate sources.

		Let's get this right. This is a book about Samba, not about OpenLDAP and secure
		communication protocols for subjects other than Samba. Earlier on, you note,
		that the dynamic DNS and DHCP solutions also used no protective secure communications
		protocols. The reason for this is simple: There are so many ways of implementing
		secure protocols that this book would have been even larger and more complex.
		</p><p>
		The solutions presented here all work (at least they did for me). Network administrators
		have the interest and the need to be better trained and instructed in secure networking
		practices and ought to implement safe systems. I made the decision, right or wrong,
		to keep this material as simple as possible. The intent of this book is to demonstrate
		a working solution and not to discuss too many peripheral issues.
		</p><p>
		This book makes little mention of backup techniques. Does that mean that I am recommending
		that you should implement a network without provision for data recovery and for disaster
		management? Back to our focus: The deployment of Samba has been clearly demonstrated.

		Both Red Hat Linux and SUSE Linux comply with the Linux Standards Base specifications
		for a standard Linux distribution. The differences are marginal. Surely you know
		your Linux platform, and you do have access to administration manuals for it. This
		book is not a Linux tutorial; it is a Samba tutorial. Let's keep the focus on
		the Samba part of the book; all the other bits are peripheral (but important) to
		creation of a total network solution. 
		</p><p>
		What I find interesting is the attention reviewers give to Linux installation and to
		the look and feel of the desktop, but does that make for a great server? In this book,
		I have paid particular attention to the details of creating a whole solution framework.
		I have not tightened every nut and bolt, but I have touched on all the issues you
		need to be familiar with. Over the years many people have approached me wanting to
		know the details of exactly how to implement a DHCP and dynamic DNS server with Samba
		and WINS. In this chapter, it is plain to see what needs to be configured to provide
		transparent interoperability. Likewise for CUPS and Samba interoperation. These are
		key stumbling areas for many people.
		</p><p>
		At every critical junction, I have provided comparative guidance for both SUSE and
		Red Hat Linux. Both manufacturers have done a great job in furthering the cause
		of open source software. I favor neither and respect both. I like particular
		features of both products (companies also). No bias in presentation is intended.
		Oh, before I forget, I particularly like Debian Linux; that is my favorite playground.

		That is a good question. As it is, the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file configurations are presented
		in as direct a format as possible. Adding SWAT into the equation would have complicated
		matters. I sought simplicity of implementation. The fact is that I did use SWAT to
		create the files in the first place.
		</p><p>
		There are people in the Linux and open source community who feel that SWAT is dangerous
		and insecure. Many will not touch it with a barge-pole. By not introducing SWAT, I

		Yes, you can do that for user accounts only. Samba requires there to be a POSIX (UNIX)
		group account for every Windows domain group account. But if you put your users into
		the system password account, how do you plan to keep all domain controller system
		password files in sync? I think that having everything in LDAP makes a lot of sense

		Samba uses a well-known public algorithm for assigning RIDs from UIDs and GIDs.
		This algorithm ought to ensure that there will be no clashes with well-known RIDs.
		Well-known RIDs have special significance to MS Windows clients. The automatic
		assignment used the calculation: RID = UID x 2 + 1000. Of course, Samba does
		permit you to override that to some extent. See the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> man page entry

		No. You can use any type of printer and must use the interfacing protocol supported
		by the printer. Many networks use LPR/LPD print servers to which are attached
		PCL printers, inkjet printers, plotters, and so on. At home I use a USB-attached
		inkjet printer. Use the appropriate device URI (Universal Resource Interface)

		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		The only loss of data I know of that involved folder redirection was caused by
		manual misuse of the redirection tool. The administrator redirected a folder to
		a network drive and said he wanted to migrate (move) the data over. Then he 
		changed his mind, so he moved the folder back to the roaming profile. This time,
		he declined to move the data because he thought it was still in the local profile
		folder. That was not the case, so by declining to move the data back, he wiped out
		the data. You cannot hold the tool responsible for that. Caveat emptor still applies.
