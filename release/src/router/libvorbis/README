********************************************************************

Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the
month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
All the technical details are published and documented, and any
software entity may make full use of the format without license 
fee, royalty or patent concerns.

This package contains:

* libvorbis, a BSD-style license software implementation of
  the Vorbis specification by the Xiph.Org Foundation 
  (http://www.xiph.org/) 

* libvorbisfile, a BSD-style license convenience library
  built on Vorbis designed to simplify common uses

* libvorbisenc, a BSD-style license library that provides a simple,
  programmatic encoding setup interface 

* example code making use of libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile and
  libvorbisenc

WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes libvorbis and an example
encoder/player to demonstrate use of libvorbis as well as
documentation on the Ogg Vorbis audio coding format.

You'll need libogg (distributed separately) to compile this library.
A more comprehensive set of utilities is available in the vorbis-tools
package.

BUILDING FROM TRUNK:

Development source is under subversion revision control at 
https://svn.xiph.org/trunk/vorbis/. You will also need the 
newest versions of autoconf, automake, libtool and pkg-config in
order to compile Vorbis from development source. A configure script
is provided for you in the source tarball distributions.

  [update or checkout latest source]
  ./autogen.sh
  make

and as root if desired:

  make install

This will install the Vorbis libraries (static and shared) into
/usr/local/lib, includes into /usr/local/include and API manpages
(once we write some) into /usr/local/man.

Documentation building requires xsltproc and pdfxmltex.

BUILDING FROM TARBALL DISTRIBUTIONS:

  ./configure
  make

and optionally (as root):
  make install

BUILDING RPMS:

after normal configuring:

  make dist
  rpm -ta libvorbis-<version>.tar.gz

BUILDING ON MACOS 9:

Vorbis on MacOS 9 is built using Metroworks CodeWarrior.  To build it, 
first verify that the Ogg libraries are already built following the
instructions in the Ogg module README.  Open vorbis/mac/libvorbis.mcp,
switch to the "Targets" pane, select everything, and make the project.
Do the same thing to build libvorbisenc.mcp, and libvorbisfile.mcp (in
that order).  In vorbis/mac/Output you will now have both debug and final
versions of Vorbis shared libraries to link your projects against.

To build a project using Ogg Vorbis, add access paths to your
CodeWarrior project for the ogg/include, ogg/mac/Output,
vorbis/include, and vorbis/mac/Output folders.  Be sure that
"interpret DOS and Unix paths" is turned on in your project; it can
be found in the "access paths" pane in your project settings.  Now
simply add the shared libraries you need to your project (OggLib and
VorbisLib at least) and #include "ogg/ogg.h" and "vorbis/codec.h"
wherever you need to access Ogg and Vorbis functionality.
