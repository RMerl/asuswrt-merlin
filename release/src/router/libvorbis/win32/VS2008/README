libvorbis has libogg as a dependency, you need to have libogg
compiled beforehand.

Lets say you have libogg and libvorbis in the same directory:

libogg-1.1.3 
libvorbis-1.2.0

Because there is no automatic library detection you have to,
either:

1. Rename libogg-1.1.3 to libogg

2. Open libogg.vsprops with a text editor (even notepad.exe
will suffice) and see if LIBOGG_VERSION is set to the correct
version, in this case "1.1.3"
