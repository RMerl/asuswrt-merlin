# PURPOSE: This script automatically sets the proper /etc/resolv.conf entries
# as pulled down from an OpenVPN server.

# INSTALL NOTES:
# Place this in /etc/openvpn/client.up
# Then, add the following to your /etc/openvpn/<clientconfig>.conf:
#   client
#   up /etc/openvpn/client.up
# Next, "chmod a+x /etc/openvpn/client.up"

# USAGE NOTES:
# Note that this script is best served with the companion "client.down"
# script.

# Tested under Debian lenny with OpenVPN 2.1_rc11
# It should work with any UNIX with a POSIX sh, /etc/resolv.conf or resolvconf

# This runs with the context of the OpenVPN UID/GID 
# at the time of execution. This generally means that
# the client "up" script will run fine, but the "down" script
# will require the use of the OpenVPN "down-root" plugin
# which is in the plugins/ directory of the OpenVPN source tree

# A horrid work around, from a security perspective,
# is to run OpenVPN as root. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. You have
# been WARNED.

# $foreign_option_<n> is something like

# each DNS option becomes a "nameserver" option in resolv.conf
# if we get one DOMAIN, that becomes "domain" in resolv.conf
# if we get multiple DOMAINS, those become "search" lines in resolv.conf
# if we get no DOMAINS, then don't use either domain or search.
