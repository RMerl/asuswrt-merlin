# An xinetd configuration file for OpenVPN.
#
# This file should be renamed to openvpn or something suitably
# descriptive and copied to the /etc/xinetd.d directory.
# xinetd can then be made aware of this file by restarting
# it or sending it a SIGHUP signal.
#
# For each potential incoming client, create a separate version
# of this configuration file on a unique port number.  Also note
# that the key file and ifconfig endpoints should be unique for
# each client.  This configuration assumes that the OpenVPN
# executable and key live in /root/openvpn.  Change this to fit
# your environment.
