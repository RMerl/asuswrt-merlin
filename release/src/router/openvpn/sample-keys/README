Sample RSA keys.

See the examples section of the man page
for usage examples.

NOTE: THESE KEYS ARE FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.
      DON'T USE THEM FOR ANY REAL WORK BECAUSE
      THEY ARE TOTALLY INSECURE!

ca.{crt,key}     -- sample CA key/cert
client.{crt,key} -- sample client key/cert
server.{crt,key} -- sample server key/cert (nsCertType=server)
pass.{crt,key}   -- sample client key/cert with password-encrypted key
                    password = "password"
