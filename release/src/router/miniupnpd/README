The miniUPnP daemon is an UPnP IGD (internet gateway device)
which provide NAT traversal services to any UPnP enabled client on
the network.
See http://www.upnp.org/ for more details on UPnP.
During the year 2011, support for IGD v2 has been added.
In 2012, IGD v2 WANIPv6FirewallControl has been implemented.
It is not yes enabled by default because it still needs testing.

Support for the NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) has been
added. See information about NAT-PMP here :
http://miniupnp.free.fr/nat-pmp.html

NAT-PMP is the precursor of Port Control Protocol (PCP).
In 2013, support for PCP has been added too.
