# LAN network interfaces IPs / networks

# A port range is <min port>-<max port> or <port> if there is only

# it is advised to only allow redirection of port above 1024
# and to finish the rule set with "deny 0-65535 0.0.0.0/0 0-65535"
# The following default ruleset allows specific LAN side IP addresses
# to request only ephemeral ports. it is recommended that users
# modify the IP ranges to match their own internal networks, and
# also consider implementing network-specific restrictions
# CAUTION: failure to enforce any rules may permit insecure requests to be made!
