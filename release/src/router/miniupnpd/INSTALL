miniupnpd is still under active developpement. This documentation is
likely to be a little outdated when you read it. So please go on the
web forum http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/ if you need more information.

================================ *BSD/pf =================================
To Build and Install :

- use BSD make to compile.
- you can first 'make config.h' then edit config.h to your preferences and
  finally 'make'
- add "rdr-anchor miniupnpd" and "anchor miniupnpd" lines to /etc/pf.conf
- some FreeBSD users reported that it is also necessary for them
  to explicitly allow udp traffic on 239.0.0.0/8 by adding the two following
  lines to /etc/pf.conf :
   pass out on $int_if from any to 239.0.0.0/8 keep state
   pass in on $int_if from any to 239.0.0.0/8 keep state
- dont forget to " pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf "
- you can check your modifications are taken into accout with
  "pfctl -s nat" and "pfctl -s rule". Look for the "rdr-anchor miniupnpd"
  and "anchor miniupnpd" lines.
- install as root using :
  # make install
  or  
  # PREFIX=/usr/local make install
- run as root : The daemon needs rights to modify pf rules.

edit the /etc/miniupnpd.conf file to set options. All options are also
available through command line switches.
To stop the daemon use :
  > kill `cat /var/run/miniupnpd.pid`

=========================== *BSD,*Solaris/ipf =============================

genconfig.sh and the Makefile try to detect wether ipf or pf should be
used. If it fails, edit config.h and Makefile by hand.
In Makefile, the FWNAME variable value should be pf or ipf.
Installation steps are allmost the same as with pf.

*Solaris users would be interested in reading informations from :

============================ Linux/netfilter ==============================
To Build and install :

- make sure you have libiptc available on your system :
  if you are using debian, "apt-get install iptables-dev"
  In anycase, libiptc is available in iptables sources packages
  from http://netfilter.org
- edit and run netfilter/iptables_init.sh shell script.
  This script must allways be run before the daemon
  to set up intial rules and chains.
- Build and edit the config.h file
  > make -f Makefile.linux config.h
  > vi config.h
- Build the daemon
  > make -f Makefile.linux
  If not using iptables from your system, 
  > IPTABLESPATH=/path/to/iptables-1.4.1 make -f Makefile.linux
  note : make sure you have iptables with static libraries compiled.
  use "./configure --enable-static" before compiling iptables
- install as root using :
  > make -f Makefile.linux install
- A miniupnpd script should be installed to /etc/init.d
  and the configuration files to /etc/miniupnpd
- anytime, you can use the netfilter/iptables_flush.sh
  script to flush all rules added by the daemon.
- after killing the daemon, you can get back to
  iptables initial state by runing the netfilter/iptables_removeall.sh
  script. Don't forget to edit the script to your convinience.

NOTE: a /etc/init.d/miniupnpd script will be installed.
  If it suits you, you can use is with start, stop or restart argument.
  # /etc/init.d/miniupnpd restart

=========================== Configuration =============================
Edit the /etc/miniupnpd.conf file to set options. All options are also
available through command line switches.

Miniupnpd supports some kind of security check for allowing or disallowing
redirection to be made. The UPnP permission rules are read from the
miniupnpd.conf configuration file.
When a new redirection is asked, permission rules are evaluated in top-down
order and the first permission rule matched gives the answer : redirection
allowed or denied. If no rule is matching, the redirection is allowed, so
it is a good practice to have a "catch all" deny permission rule at the end
of your mermission ruleset.
Sample permission ruleset :
allow 4662-4672 192.168.1.34/32 4662-4672
deny 0-65535 192.168.1.34/32 0-65535
allow 1024-65535 192.168.1.0/24 1024-65535
deny 0-65535 0.0.0.0/0 0-65535
With this ruleset, redirections are allowed only for host on the subnet
192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 for the ports 1024 or above. There is an exception
for the host 192.168.1.34 for which only redirections from/to port 4662 to
4672 are allowed.

You can generate the uuid for your UPnP device with the uuidgen available
under linux. The following following OpenBSD package is also providing
a "uuid" tool :
http://www.openbsd.org/4.0_packages/i386/uuid-1.5.0.tgz-long.html
An web based uuid generator is also available :
http://kruithof.xs4all.nl/uuid/uuidgen

On linux systems, one could also use the command
'cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid' to generate an uuid.

To stop the daemon use :
  # kill `cat /var/run/miniupnpd.pid`
or if your linux system use /etc/init.d/ 
  # /etc/init.d/miniupnpd stop
