.SH "NAME"
tor \- The second\-generation onion router
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBtor\fR [\fIOPTION\fR \fIvalue\fR]\&...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Tor is a connection\-oriented anonymizing communication service\&. Users choose a source\-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others\&. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node\&.
.sp
Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of servers or relays ("onion routers")\&. Users bounce their TCP streams \(em web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc\&. \(em around the network, and recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream\&.
.sp
By default, \fBtor\fR will only act as a client only\&. To help the network by providing bandwidth as a relay, change the \fBORPort\fR configuration option \(em see below\&. Please also consult the documentation on the Tor Project\(cqs website\&.
.SH "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"

\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR|\fB\-\-hush\fR
.RS 4
Override the default console log\&. By default, Tor starts out logging messages at level "notice" and higher to the console\&. It stops doing so after it parses its configuration, if the configuration tells it to log anywhere else\&. You can override this behavior with the
\fB\-\-hush\fR
option, which tells Tor to only send warnings and errors to the console, or with the
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
option, which tells Tor not to log to the console at all\&.
.RE
.sp
Other options can be specified on the command\-line in the format "\-\-option value", in the format "option value", or in a configuration file\&. For instance, you can tell Tor to start listening for SOCKS connections on port 9999 by passing \-\-SOCKSPort 9999 or SOCKSPort 9999 to it on the command line, or by putting "SOCKSPort 9999" in the configuration file\&. You will need to quote options with spaces in them: if you want Tor to log all debugging messages to debug\&.log, you will probably need to say \-\-Log \fIdebug file debug\&.log\fR\&.
.sp
Options on the command line override those in configuration files\&. See the next section for more information\&.
.SH "THE CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
.sp
All configuration options in a configuration are written on a single line by default\&. They take the form of an option name and a value, or an option name and a quoted value (option value or option "value")\&. Anything after a # character is treated as a comment\&. Options are case\-insensitive\&. C\-style escaped characters are allowed inside quoted values\&. To split one configuration entry into multiple lines, use a single backslash character (\e) before the end of the line\&. Comments can be used in such multiline entries, but they must start at the beginning of a line\&.
.sp
By default, an option on the command line overrides an option found in the configuration file, and an option in a configuration file overrides one in the defaults file\&.
.sp
This rule is simple for options that take a single value, but it can become complicated for options that are allowed to occur more than once: if you specify four SOCKSPorts in your configuration file, and one more SOCKSPort on the command line, the option on the command line will replace \fIall\fR of the SOCKSPorts in the configuration file\&. If this isn\(cqt what you want, prefix the option name with a plus sign, and it will be appended to the previous set of options instead\&.
.sp
Alternatively, you might want to remove every instance of an option in the configuration file, and not replace it at all: you might want to say on the command line that you want no SOCKSPorts at all\&. To do that, prefix the option name with a forward slash\&.

\fBBandwidthRate\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKBytes\fR|\fBMBytes\fR|\fBGBytes\fR|\fBKBits\fR|\fBMBits\fR|\fBGBits\fR
.RS 4
A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing bandwidth usage to that same value\&. If you want to run a relay in the public network, this needs to be
\fIat the very least\fR
30 KBytes (that is, 30720 bytes)\&. (Default: 1 GByte)

With this option, and in other options that take arguments in bytes, KBytes, and so on, other formats are also supported\&. Notably, "KBytes" can also be written as "kilobytes" or "kb"; "MBytes" can be written as "megabytes" or "MB"; "kbits" can be written as "kilobits"; and so forth\&. Tor also accepts "byte" and "bit" in the singular\&. The prefixes "tera" and "T" are also recognized\&. If no units are given, we default to bytes\&. To avoid confusion, we recommend writing "bytes" or "bits" explicitly, since it\(cqs easy to forget that "B" means bytes, not bits\&.

If set, we will not advertise more than this amount of bandwidth for our BandwidthRate\&. Server operators who want to reduce the number of clients who ask to build circuits through them (since this is proportional to advertised bandwidth rate) can thus reduce the CPU demands on their server without impacting network performance\&.

In its first form, when set along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client forwards its traffic to a SOCKS\-speaking proxy on "IP:PORT"\&. It\(cqs the duty of that proxy to properly forward the traffic to the bridge\&.

In its second form, when set along with a corresponding Bridge line, the Tor client launches the pluggable transport proxy executable in

[Making the file readable by other groups is not yet implemented; let us know if you need this for some reason\&.] (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBConnLimit\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS 4
The minimum number of file descriptors that must be available to the Tor process before it will start\&. Tor will ask the OS for as many file descriptors as the OS will allow (you can find this by "ulimit \-H \-n")\&. If this number is less than ConnLimit, then Tor will refuse to start\&.

You probably don\(cqt need to adjust this\&. It has no effect on Windows since that platform lacks getrlimit()\&. (Default: 1000)
.RE

\fBDisableNetwork\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
When this option is set, we don\(cqt listen for or accept any connections other than controller connections, and we close (and don\(cqt reattempt) any outbound connections\&. Controllers sometimes use this option to avoid using the network until Tor is fully configured\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBConstrainedSockets\fR \fB0\fR|\fB1\fR
.RS 4
If set, Tor will tell the kernel to attempt to shrink the buffers for all sockets to the size specified in
\fBConstrainedSockSize\fR\&. This is useful for virtual servers and other environments where system level TCP buffers may be limited\&. If you\(cqre on a virtual server, and you encounter the "Error creating network socket: No buffer space available" message, you are likely experiencing this problem\&.

The preferred solution is to have the admin increase the buffer pool for the host itself via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem or equivalent facility; this configuration option is a second\-resort\&.

The DirPort option should also not be used if TCP buffers are scarce\&. The cached directory requests consume additional sockets which exacerbates the problem\&.

You should
\fBnot\fR
enable this feature unless you encounter the "no buffer space available" issue\&. Reducing the TCP buffers affects window size for the TCP stream and will reduce throughput in proportion to round trip time on long paths\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBConstrainedSockSize\fR \fIN\fR \fBbytes\fR|\fBKBytes\fR
.RS 4
When
\fBConstrainedSockets\fR
is enabled the receive and transmit buffers for all sockets will be set to this limit\&. Must be a value between 2048 and 262144, in 1024 byte increments\&. Default of 8192 is recommended\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBControlPort\fR \fIPORT\fR|\fBauto\fR
.RS 4
If set, Tor will accept connections on this port and allow those connections to control the Tor process using the Tor Control Protocol (described in control\-spec\&.txt)\&. Note: unless you also specify one or more of
\fBHashedControlPassword\fR
or
\fBCookieAuthentication\fR, setting this option will cause Tor to allow any process on the local host to control it\&. (Setting both authentication methods means either method is sufficient to authenticate to Tor\&.) This option is required for many Tor controllers; most use the value of 9051\&. Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you\&. (Default: 0)
.RE
.PP
\fBControlListenAddress\fR \fIIP\fR[:\fIPORT\fR]
.RS 4
Bind the controller listener to this address\&. If you specify a port, bind to this port rather than the one specified in ControlPort\&. We strongly recommend that you leave this alone unless you know what you\(cqre doing, since giving attackers access to your control listener is really dangerous\&. This directive can be specified multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports\&. (Default: 127\&.0\&.0\&.1)

.RS 4
Use a nonstandard authoritative directory server at the provided address and port, with the specified key fingerprint\&. This option can be repeated many times, for multiple authoritative directory servers\&. Flags are separated by spaces, and determine what kind of an authority this directory is\&. By default, an authority is not authoritative for any directory style or version unless an appropriate flag is given\&. Tor will use this authority as a bridge authoritative directory if the "bridge" flag is set\&. If a flag "orport=\fBport\fR" is given, Tor will use the given port when opening encrypted tunnels to the dirserver\&. If a flag "weight=\fBnum\fR" is given, then the directory server is chosen randomly with probability proportional to that weight (default 1\&.0)\&. Lastly, if a flag "v3ident=\fBfp\fR" is given, the dirserver is a v3 directory authority whose v3 long\-term signing key has the fingerprint
\fBfp\fR\&.

If no
\fBDirAuthority\fR
line is given, Tor will use the default directory authorities\&. NOTE: this option is intended for setting up a private Tor network with its own directory authorities\&. If you use it, you will be distinguishable from other users, because you won\(cqt believe the same authorities they do\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDirAuthorityFallbackRate\fR \fINUM\fR

We believe that this feature works on modern Gnu/Linux distributions, and that it may also work on *BSD systems (untested)\&. Some modern Gnu/Linux systems such as Ubuntu have the kernel\&.yama\&.ptrace_scope sysctl and by default enable it as an attempt to limit the PTRACE scope for all user processes by default\&.

For example, once you\(cqve done that, you could allow HTTP to 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 and block all other connections to internal networks with "accept 127\&.0\&.0\&.1:80,reject private:*", though that may also allow connections to your own computer that are addressed to its public (external) IP address\&. See RFC 1918 and RFC 3330 for more details about internal and reserved IP address space\&.

Tor also allow IPv6 exit policy entries\&. For instance, "reject6 [FC00::]/7:*" rejects all destinations that share 7 most significant bit prefix with address FC00::\&. Respectively, "accept6 [C000::]/3:*" accepts all destinations that share 3 most significant bit prefix with address C000::\&.

This directive can be specified multiple times so you don\(cqt have to put it all on one line\&.

Policies are considered first to last, and the first match wins\&. If you want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end your exit policy with either a reject *:* or an accept *:*\&. Otherwise, you\(cqre _augmenting_ (prepending to) the default exit policy\&. The default exit policy is:
