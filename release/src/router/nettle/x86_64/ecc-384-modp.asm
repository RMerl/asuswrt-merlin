	C First get top 2 limbs, which need folding twice.
	C B^10 = B^6 + B^4 + 2^32 (B-1)B^4.
	C We handle the terms as follow:
	C
	C B^6: Folded immediatly.
	C
	C B^4: Delayed, added in in the next folding.
	C
	C 2^32(B-1) B^4: Low half limb delayed until the next
	C folding. Top 1.5 limbs subtracted and shifter now, resulting
	C in 2.5 limbs. The low limb saved in D5, high 1.5 limbs added
	C in.
