1 Introduction
**************

Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more
or less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages
(C++, Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in
kernel space. In most contexts, you need more than the basic
cryptographic algorithms, you also need some way to keep track of
available algorithms, their properties and variants. You often have
some algorithm selection process, often dictated by a protocol you want
to implement.

   And as the requirements of applications differ in subtle and not so
subtle ways, an API that fits one application well can be a pain to use
in a different context. And that is why there are so many different
cryptographic libraries around.

   Nettle tries to avoid this problem by doing one thing, the low-level
crypto stuff, and providing a _simple_ but general interface to it.  In
particular, Nettle doesn't do algorithm selection. It doesn't do memory
allocation. It doesn't do any I/O.

   The idea is that one can build several application and context
specific interfaces on top of Nettle, and share the code, test cases,
benchmarks, documentation, etc. Examples are the Nettle module for the
Pike language, and LSH, which both use an object-oriented abstraction
on top of the library.

   This manual explains how to use the Nettle library. It also tries to
provide some background on the cryptography, and advice on how to best
put it to use.

3 Conventions
*************

For each supported algorithm, there is an include file that defines a
_context struct_, a few constants, and declares functions for operating
on the context. The context struct encapsulates all information needed
by the algorithm, and it can be copied or moved in memory with no
unexpected effects.

   For consistency, functions for different algorithms are very similar,
but there are some differences, for instance reflecting if the key setup
or encryption function differ for encryption and decryption, and whether
or not key setup can fail. There are also differences between algorithms
that don't show in function prototypes, but which the application must
nevertheless be aware of. There is no big difference between the
functions for stream ciphers and for block ciphers, although they should
be used quite differently by the application.

   If your application uses more than one algorithm of the same type,
you should probably create an interface that is tailor-made for your
needs, and then write a few lines of glue code on top of Nettle.

   By convention, for an algorithm named `foo', the struct tag for the
context struct is `foo_ctx', constants and functions uses prefixes like
`FOO_BLOCK_SIZE' (a constant) and `foo_set_key' (a function).

   In all functions, strings are represented with an explicit length, of
type `size_t', and a pointer of type `uint8_t *' or `const uint8_t *'.
For functions that transform one string to another, the argument order
is length, destination pointer and source pointer. Source and
destination areas are usually of the same length.  When they differ,
e.g., for `ccm_encrypt_message', the length argument specifies the size
of the destination area. Source and destination pointers may be equal,
so that you can process strings in place, but source and destination
areas _must not_ overlap in any other way.

   Many of the functions lack return value and can never fail. Those
functions which can fail, return one on success and zero on failure.

4 Example
*********

A simple example program that reads a file from standard input and
writes its SHA1 check-sum on standard output should give the flavor of
Nettle.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     #include <nettle/sha1.h>

     #define BUF_SIZE 1000

     static void
     display_hex(unsigned length, uint8_t *data)
     {
       unsigned i;

       for (i = 0; i<length; i++)
         printf("%02x ", data[i]);

       printf("\n");
     }

     int
     main(int argc, char **argv)
     {
       struct sha1_ctx ctx;
       uint8_t buffer[BUF_SIZE];
       uint8_t digest[SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE];

       sha1_init(&ctx);
       for (;;)
       {
         int done = fread(buffer, 1, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
         sha1_update(&ctx, done, buffer);
         if (done < sizeof(buffer))
           break;
       }
       if (ferror(stdin))
         return EXIT_FAILURE;

       sha1_digest(&ctx, SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE, digest);

       display_hex(SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE, digest);
       return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }

   On a typical Unix system, this program can be compiled and linked
with the command line
     gcc sha-example.c -o sha-example -lnettle

5 Linking
*********

Nettle actually consists of two libraries, `libnettle' and
`libhogweed'. The `libhogweed' library contains those functions of
Nettle that uses bignum operations, and depends on the GMP library.
With this division, linking works the same for both static and dynamic
libraries.

   If an application uses only the symmetric crypto algorithms of Nettle
(i.e., block ciphers, hash functions, and the like), it's sufficient to
link with `-lnettle'. If an application also uses public-key
algorithms, the recommended linker flags are `-lhogweed -lnettle
-lgmp'. If the involved libraries are installed as dynamic libraries, it
may be sufficient to link with just `-lhogweed', and the loader will
resolve the dependencies automatically.

6.1 Hash functions
==================

A cryptographic "hash function" is a function that takes variable size
strings, and maps them to strings of fixed, short, length. There are
naturally lots of collisions, as there are more possible 1MB files than
20 byte strings. But the function is constructed such that is hard to
find the collisions. More precisely, a cryptographic hash function `H'
should have the following properties:

_One-way_
     Given a hash value `H(x)' it is hard to find a string `x' that
     hashes to that value.

_Collision-resistant_
     It is hard to find two different strings, `x' and `y', such that
     `H(x)' = `H(y)'.


   Hash functions are useful as building blocks for digital signatures,
message authentication codes, pseudo random generators, association of
unique ids to documents, and many other things.

   The most commonly used hash functions are MD5 and SHA1.
Unfortunately, both these fail the collision-resistance requirement;
cryptologists have found ways to construct colliding inputs. The
recommended hash functions for new applications are SHA2 (with main
variants SHA256 and SHA512). At the time of this writing (December
2012), the winner of the NIST SHA3 competition has recently been
announced, and the new SHA3 (earlier known as Keccak) and other top
SHA3 candidates may also be reasonable alternatives.

6.1.1 Recommended hash functions
--------------------------------

The following hash functions have no known weaknesses, and are suitable
for new applications. The SHA2 family of hash functions were specified
by "NIST", intended as a replacement for SHA1.

6.1.1.1 SHA256
..............

SHA256 is a member of the SHA2 family. It outputs hash values of 256
bits, or 32 octets. Nettle defines SHA256 in `<nettle/sha2.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct sha256_ctx

 -- Constant: SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of a SHA256 digest, i.e. 32.

 -- Constant: SHA256_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of SHA256. Useful for some special
     constructions, in particular HMAC-SHA256.

 -- Function: void sha256_init (struct sha256_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the SHA256 state.

 -- Function: void sha256_update (struct sha256_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

 -- Function: void sha256_digest (struct sha256_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Performs final processing and extracts the message digest, writing
     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE', in
     which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `sha256_init'.

   Earlier versions of nettle defined SHA256 in the header file
`<nettle/sha.h>', which is now deprecated, but kept for compatibility.

6.1.1.2 SHA224
..............

SHA224 is a variant of SHA256, with a different initial state, and with
the output truncated to 224 bits, or 28 octets. Nettle defines SHA224 in
`<nettle/sha2.h>' (and in `<nettle/sha.h>', for backwards
compatibility).

 -- Context struct: struct sha224_ctx

 -- Constant: SHA224_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of a SHA224 digest, i.e. 28.

 -- Constant: SHA224_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of SHA224. Useful for some special
     constructions, in particular HMAC-SHA224.

 -- Function: void sha224_init (struct sha224_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the SHA224 state.

 -- Function: void sha224_update (struct sha224_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

 -- Function: void sha224_digest (struct sha224_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Performs final processing and extracts the message digest, writing
     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `SHA224_DIGEST_SIZE', in
     which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `sha224_init'.

6.1.1.3 SHA512
..............

SHA512 is a larger sibling to SHA256, with a very similar structure but
with both the output and the internal variables of twice the size. The
internal variables are 64 bits rather than 32, making it significantly
slower on 32-bit computers. It outputs hash values of 512 bits, or 64
octets. Nettle defines SHA512 in `<nettle/sha2.h>' (and in
`<nettle/sha.h>', for backwards compatibility).

 -- Context struct: struct sha512_ctx

 -- Constant: SHA512_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of a SHA512 digest, i.e. 64.

 -- Constant: SHA512_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of SHA512, 128. Useful for some special
     constructions, in particular HMAC-SHA512.

 -- Function: void sha512_init (struct sha512_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the SHA512 state.

 -- Function: void sha512_update (struct sha512_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

 -- Function: void sha512_digest (struct sha512_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Performs final processing and extracts the message digest, writing
     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `SHA512_DIGEST_SIZE', in
     which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `sha512_init'.

6.1.1.4 SHA384 and other variants of SHA512
...........................................

Several variants of SHA512 have been defined, with a different initial
state, and with the output truncated to shorter length than 512 bits.
Naming is a bit confused, these algorithms are called SHA512-224,
SHA512-256 and SHA384, for output sizes of 224, 256 and 384 bits,
respectively. Nettle defines these in `<nettle/sha2.h>' (and in
`<nettle/sha.h>', for backwards compatibility).

 -- Context struct: struct sha512_224_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct sha512_256_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct sha384_ctx
     These context structs are all the same as sha512_ctx. They are
     defined as simple preprocessor aliases, which may cause some
     problems if used as identifiers for other purposes. So avoid doing
     that.

 -- Constant: SHA512_224_DIGEST_SIZE
 -- Constant: SHA512_256_DIGEST_SIZE
 -- Constant: SHA384_DIGEST_SIZE
     The digest size for each variant, i.e., 28, 32, and 48,
     respectively.

 -- Constant: SHA512_224_BLOCK_SIZE
 -- Constant: SHA512_256_BLOCK_SIZE
 -- Constant: SHA384_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size, same as SHA512_BLOCK_SIZE, i.e., 128.
     Useful for some special constructions, in particular HMAC-SHA384.

 -- Function: void sha512_224_init (struct sha512_224_ctx *CTX)
 -- Function: void sha512_256_init (struct sha512_256_ctx *CTX)
 -- Function: void sha384_init (struct sha384_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the context struct.

 -- Function: void sha512_224_update (struct sha512_224_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
 -- Function: void sha512_256_update (struct sha512_256_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
 -- Function: void sha384_update (struct sha384_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data. These are all aliases for sha512_update,
     which does the same thing.

 -- Function: void sha512_224_digest (struct sha512_224_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
 -- Function: void sha512_256_digest (struct sha512_256_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
 -- Function: void sha384_digest (struct sha384_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Performs final processing and extracts the message digest, writing
     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than the specified digest
     size, in which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are
     written.

     These function also reset the context in the same way as the
     corresponding init function.

6.1.1.5 SHA3-224
................

The SHA3 hash functions were specified by NIST in response to weaknesses
in SHA1, and doubts about SHA2 hash functions which structurally are
very similar to SHA1. SHA3 is a result of a competition, where the
winner, also known as Keccak, was designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan
Daemen, Michaël Peeters and Gilles Van Assche. It is structurally very
different from all widely used earlier hash functions. Like SHA2, there
are several variants, with output sizes of 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits
(28, 32, 48 and 64 octets, respectively).

   Nettle's implementation of SHA3 should be considered *experimental*.
It is based on the design from the competition.  Unfortunately, it is
likely that when the standard is finalized, there will be small changes
making Nettle's current implementation incompatible with the standard.
Nettle's implementation may need incompatible changes to track
standardization. Latest standard draft, at the time of writing, is at
`http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/fips-202/fips_202_draft.pdf'.

   Nettle defines SHA3-224 in `<nettle/sha3.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct sha3_224_ctx

 -- Constant: SHA3_224_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of a SHA3_224 digest, i.e., 28.

 -- Constant: SHA3_224_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of SHA3_224.

 -- Function: void sha3_224_init (struct sha3_224_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the SHA3-224 state.

 -- Function: void sha3_224_update (struct sha3_224_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

 -- Function: void sha3_224_digest (struct sha3_224_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Performs final processing and extracts the message digest, writing
     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `SHA3_224_DIGEST_SIZE',
     in which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are
     written.

     This function also resets the context.

6.1.1.6 SHA3-256
................

This is SHA3 with 256-bit output size, and possibly the most useful of
the SHA3 hash functions.

   Nettle defines SHA3-256 in `<nettle/sha3.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct sha3_256_ctx

 -- Constant: SHA3_256_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of a SHA3_256 digest, i.e., 32.

 -- Constant: SHA3_256_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of SHA3_256.

 -- Function: void sha3_256_init (struct sha3_256_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the SHA3-256 state.

 -- Function: void sha3_256_update (struct sha3_256_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

 -- Function: void sha3_256_digest (struct sha3_256_ctx *CTX, size_t

     This function also resets the context.

6.1.2 Legacy hash functions
---------------------------

The hash functions in this section all have some known weaknesses, and
should be avoided for new applications. These hash functions are mainly
useful for compatibility with old applications and protocols. Some are
still considered safe as building blocks for particular constructions,
e.g., there seems to be no known attacks against HMAC-SHA1 or even
HMAC-MD5. In some important cases, use of a "legacy" hash function does
not in itself make the application insecure; if a known weakness is
relevant depends on how the hash function is used, and on the threat
model.

6.1.2.1 MD5
...........

MD5 is a message digest function constructed by Ronald Rivest, and
described in `RFC 1321'. It outputs message digests of 128 bits, or 16
octets. Nettle defines MD5 in `<nettle/md5.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct md5_ctx

 -- Constant: MD5_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of an MD5 digest, i.e. 16.

 -- Constant: MD5_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of MD5. Useful for some special
     constructions, in particular HMAC-MD5.

 -- Function: void md5_init (struct md5_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the MD5 state.

 -- Function: void md5_update (struct md5_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

 -- Function: void md5_digest (struct md5_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Performs final processing and extracts the message digest, writing
     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `MD5_DIGEST_SIZE', in
     which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `md5_init'.

   The normal way to use MD5 is to call the functions in order: First
`md5_init', then `md5_update' zero or more times, and finally
`md5_digest'. After `md5_digest', the context is reset to its initial
state, so you can start over calling `md5_update' to hash new data.

   To start over, you can call `md5_init' at any time.

6.1.2.2 MD2
...........

MD2 is another hash function of Ronald Rivest's, described in `RFC
1319'. It outputs message digests of 128 bits, or 16 octets.  Nettle
defines MD2 in `<nettle/md2.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct md2_ctx

 -- Constant: MD2_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of an MD2 digest, i.e. 16.

 -- Constant: MD2_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of MD2.

 -- Function: void md2_init (struct md2_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the MD2 state.

          const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

 -- Function: void md2_digest (struct md2_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Performs final processing and extracts the message digest, writing
     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `MD2_DIGEST_SIZE', in
     which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `md2_init'.

6.1.2.3 MD4
...........

MD4 is a predecessor of MD5, described in `RFC 1320'. Like MD5, it is
constructed by Ronald Rivest. It outputs message digests of 128 bits,
or 16 octets. Nettle defines MD4 in `<nettle/md4.h>'. Use of MD4 is not
recommended, but it is sometimes needed for compatibility with existing
applications and protocols.

 -- Context struct: struct md4_ctx

 -- Constant: MD4_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of an MD4 digest, i.e. 16.

          const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

 -- Function: void md4_digest (struct md4_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Performs final processing and extracts the message digest, writing
     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `MD4_DIGEST_SIZE', in
     which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `md4_init'.

6.1.2.4 RIPEMD160
.................

RIPEMD160 is a hash function designed by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon
Bosselaers, and Bart Preneel, as a strengthened version of RIPEMD
(which, like MD4 and MD5, fails the collision-resistance requirement).
It produces message digests of 160 bits, or 20 octets. Nettle defined
RIPEMD160 in `nettle/ripemd160.h'.

 -- Context struct: struct ripemd160_ctx

 -- Constant: RIPEMD160_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of a RIPEMD160 digest, i.e. 20.

 -- Constant: RIPEMD160_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of RIPEMD160.

 -- Function: void ripemd160_init (struct ripemd160_ctx *CTX)

     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `RIPEMD160_DIGEST_SIZE',
     in which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are
     written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `ripemd160_init'.

6.1.2.5 SHA1
............

SHA1 is a hash function specified by "NIST" (The U.S. National
Institute for Standards and Technology). It outputs hash values of 160
bits, or 20 octets. Nettle defines SHA1 in `<nettle/sha1.h>' (and in
`<nettle/sha.h>', for backwards compatibility).

 -- Context struct: struct sha1_ctx

 -- Constant: SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of a SHA1 digest, i.e. 20.

 -- Constant: SHA1_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of SHA1. Useful for some special
     constructions, in particular HMAC-SHA1.

 -- Function: void sha1_init (struct sha1_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the SHA1 state.

 -- Function: void sha1_update (struct sha1_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

          uint8_t *DIGEST)

     it to DIGEST. LENGTH may be smaller than `SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE', in
     which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `sha1_init'.

6.1.2.6 GOSTHASH94
..................

The GOST94 or GOST R 34.11-94 hash algorithm is a Soviet-era algorithm
used in Russian government standards (see `RFC 4357').  It outputs
message digests of 256 bits, or 32 octets.  Nettle defines GOSTHASH94
in `<nettle/gosthash94.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct gosthash94_ctx

 -- Constant: GOSTHASH94_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of a GOSTHASH94 digest, i.e. 32.

 -- Constant: GOSTHASH94_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of GOSTHASH94, i.e., 32.

 -- Function: void gosthash94_init (struct gosthash94_ctx *CTX)
     Initialize the GOSTHASH94 state.

 -- Function: void gosthash94_update (struct gosthash94_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Hash some more data.

     in which case only the first LENGTH octets of the digest are
     written.

     This function also resets the context in the same way as
     `gosthash94_init'.

6.1.3 The `struct nettle_hash' abstraction
------------------------------------------

Nettle includes a struct including information about the supported hash
functions. It is defined in `<nettle/nettle-meta.h>', and is used by
Nettle's implementation of HMAC (*note Keyed hash functions::).

 -- Meta struct: `struct nettle_hash' name context_size digest_size
          block_size init update digest
     The last three attributes are function pointers, of types
     `nettle_hash_init_func *', `nettle_hash_update_func *', and
     `nettle_hash_digest_func *'. The first argument to these functions
     is `void *' pointer to a context struct, which is of size
     `context_size'.

 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_md2
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_md4
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_md5
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_ripemd160
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_sha1
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_sha224
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_sha256
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_sha384
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_sha512
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_sha3_256
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_hash nettle_gosthash94
     These are all the hash functions that Nettle implements.

   Nettle also exports a list of all these hashes.

 -- Constant Array: struct nettle_hash ** nettle_hashes
     This list can be used to dynamically enumerate or search the
     supported algorithms. NULL-terminated.


File: nettle.info,  Node: Cipher functions,  Next: Cipher modes,  Prev: Hash functions,  Up: Reference

6.2 Cipher functions
====================

A "cipher" is a function that takes a message or "plaintext" and a
secret "key" and transforms it to a "ciphertext". Given only the
ciphertext, but not the key, it should be hard to find the plaintext.
Given matching pairs of plaintext and ciphertext, it should be hard to
find the key.

   There are two main classes of ciphers: Block ciphers and stream
ciphers.

   A block cipher can process data only in fixed size chunks, called
"blocks". Typical block sizes are 8 or 16 octets. To encrypt arbitrary
messages, you usually have to pad it to an integral number of blocks,
split it into blocks, and then process each block. The simplest way is
to process one block at a time, independent of each other. That mode of
operation is called "ECB", Electronic Code Book mode.  However, using
ECB is usually a bad idea. For a start, plaintext blocks that are equal
are transformed to ciphertext blocks that are equal; that leaks
information about the plaintext. Usually you should apply the cipher is
some "feedback mode", "CBC" (Cipher Block Chaining) and "CTR" (Counter
mode) being two of of the most popular. See *Note Cipher modes::, for
information on how to apply CBC and CTR with Nettle.

   A stream cipher can be used for messages of arbitrary length. A
typical stream cipher is a keyed pseudo-random generator. To encrypt a
plaintext message of N octets, you key the generator, generate N octets
of pseudo-random data, and XOR it with the plaintext. To decrypt,
regenerate the same stream using the key, XOR it to the ciphertext, and
the plaintext is recovered.

   *Caution:* The first rule for this kind of cipher is the same as for
a One Time Pad: _never_ ever use the same key twice.

   A common misconception is that encryption, by itself, implies
authentication. Say that you and a friend share a secret key, and you
receive an encrypted message. You apply the key, and get a plaintext
message that makes sense to you. Can you then be sure that it really was
your friend that wrote the message you're reading? The answer is no. For
example, if you were using a block cipher in ECB mode, an attacker may
pick up the message on its way, and reorder, delete or repeat some of
the blocks. Even if the attacker can't decrypt the message, he can
change it so that you are not reading the same message as your friend
wrote. If you are using a block cipher in CBC mode rather than ECB, or
are using a stream cipher, the possibilities for this sort of attack
are different, but the attacker can still make predictable changes to
the message.

   It is recommended to _always_ use an authentication mechanism in
addition to encrypting the messages. Popular choices are Message
Authentication Codes like HMAC-SHA1 (*note Keyed hash functions::), or
digital signatures like RSA.

   Some ciphers have so called "weak keys", keys that results in
undesirable structure after the key setup processing, and should be
avoided. In Nettle, most key setup functions have no return value, but
for ciphers with weak keys, the return value indicates whether or not
the given key is weak. For good keys, key setup returns 1, and for weak
keys, it returns 0. When possible, avoid algorithms that have weak
keys. There are several good ciphers that don't have any weak keys.

   To encrypt a message, you first initialize a cipher context for
encryption or decryption with a particular key. You then use the context
to process plaintext or ciphertext messages. The initialization is known
as "key setup". With Nettle, it is recommended to use each context
struct for only one direction, even if some of the ciphers use a single
key setup function that can be used for both encryption and decryption.

6.2.1 AES
---------

AES is a block cipher, specified by NIST as a replacement for the older
DES standard. The standard is the result of a competition between
cipher designers. The winning design, also known as RIJNDAEL, was
constructed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijnmen.

   Like all the AES candidates, the winning design uses a block size of
128 bits, or 16 octets, and three possible key-size, 128, 192 and 256
bits (16, 24 and 32 octets) being the allowed key sizes. It does not
have any weak keys. Nettle defines AES in `<nettle/aes.h>', and there
is one context struct for each key size. (Earlier versions of Nettle
used a single context struct, `struct aes_ctx', for all key sizes. This
interface kept for backwards compatibility).

 -- Context struct: struct aes128_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct aes192_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct aes256_ctx

 -- Context struct: struct aes_ctx
     Alternative struct, for the old AES interface.

 -- Constant: AES_BLOCK_SIZE
     The AES block-size, 16.

 -- Constant: AES128_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: AES192_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: AES256_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: AES_MIN_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: AES_MAX_KEY_SIZE

 -- Constant: AES_KEY_SIZE
     Default AES key size, 32.

 -- Function: void aes128_set_encrypt_key (struct aes128_ctx *CTX,
          const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void aes128_set_decrypt_key (struct aes128_ctx *CTX,
          const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void aes192_set_encrypt_key (struct aes192_ctx *CTX,
          const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void aes192_set_decrypt_key (struct aes192_ctx *CTX,
          const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void aes256_set_encrypt_key (struct aes256_ctx *CTX,
          const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void aes256_set_decrypt_key (struct aes256_ctx *CTX,
          const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void aes_set_encrypt_key (struct aes_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void aes_set_decrypt_key (struct aes_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher, for encryption or decryption, respectively.

 -- Function: void aes128_invert_key (struct aes128_ctx *DST, const
          struct aes128_ctx *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes192_invert_key (struct aes192_ctx *DST, const
          struct aes192_ctx *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes256_invert_key (struct aes256_ctx *DST, const
          struct aes256_ctx *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes_invert_key (struct aes_ctx *DST, const struct
          aes_ctx *SRC)
     Given a context SRC initialized for encryption, initializes the
     context struct DST for decryption, using the same key. If the same
     context struct is passed for both `src' and `dst', it is converted
     in place. These functions are mainly useful for applications which
     needs to both encrypt and decrypt using the _same_ key, because
     calling, e.g., `aes128_set_encrypt_key' and `aes128_invert_key',
     is more efficient than calling `aes128_set_encrypt_key' and
     `aes128_set_decrypt_key'.

 -- Function: void aes128_encrypt (struct aes128_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes192_encrypt (struct aes192_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes256_encrypt (struct aes256_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes_encrypt (struct aes_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encryption function. LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the
     block size. If it is more than one block, the data is processed in
     ECB mode. `src' and `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap
     in any other way.

 -- Function: void aes128_decrypt (struct aes128_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes192_decrypt (struct aes192_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes256_decrypt (struct aes256_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void aes_decrypt (struct aes_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Analogous to the encryption functions above.

6.2.2 ARCFOUR
-------------

ARCFOUR is a stream cipher, also known under the trade marked name RC4,
and it is one of the fastest ciphers around. A problem is that the key
setup of ARCFOUR is quite weak, you should never use keys with
structure, keys that are ordinary passwords, or sequences of keys like
"secret:1", "secret:2", .... If you have keys that don't look like
random bit strings, and you want to use ARCFOUR, always hash the key
before feeding it to ARCFOUR. Furthermore, the initial bytes of the
generated key stream leak information about the key; for this reason, it
is recommended to discard the first 512 bytes of the key stream.

     /* A more robust key setup function for ARCFOUR */
     void
     arcfour_set_key_hashed(struct arcfour_ctx *ctx,
                            size_t length, const uint8_t *key)
     {
       struct sha256_ctx hash;
       uint8_t digest[SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];
       uint8_t buffer[0x200];

       sha256_init(&hash);
       sha256_update(&hash, length, key);
       sha256_digest(&hash, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, digest);

       arcfour_set_key(ctx, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, digest);
       arcfour_crypt(ctx, sizeof(buffer), buffer, buffer);
     }

   Nettle defines ARCFOUR in `<nettle/arcfour.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct arcfour_ctx

 -- Constant: ARCFOUR_MIN_KEY_SIZE
     Minimum key size, 1.

 -- Constant: ARCFOUR_MAX_KEY_SIZE
     Maximum key size, 256.

 -- Constant: ARCFOUR_KEY_SIZE
     Default ARCFOUR key size, 16.

 -- Function: void arcfour_set_key (struct arcfour_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption.

 -- Function: void arcfour_crypt (struct arcfour_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encrypt some data. The same function is used for both encryption
     and decryption. Unlike the block ciphers, this function modifies
     the context, so you can split the data into arbitrary chunks and
     encrypt them one after another. The result is the same as if you
     had called `arcfour_crypt' only once with all the data.

6.2.3 ARCTWO
------------

ARCTWO (also known as the trade marked name RC2) is a block cipher
specified in RFC 2268. Nettle also include a variation of the ARCTWO
set key operation that lack one step, to be compatible with the reverse
engineered RC2 cipher description, as described in a Usenet post to
`sci.crypt' by Peter Gutmann.

   ARCTWO uses a block size of 64 bits, and variable key-size ranging
from 1 to 128 octets. Besides the key, ARCTWO also has a second
parameter to key setup, the number of effective key bits, `ekb'.  This
parameter can be used to artificially reduce the key size. In practice,
`ekb' is usually set equal to the input key size.  Nettle defines
ARCTWO in `<nettle/arctwo.h>'.

   We do not recommend the use of ARCTWO; the Nettle implementation is
provided primarily for interoperability with existing applications and
standards.

 -- Context struct: struct arctwo_ctx

 -- Constant: ARCTWO_BLOCK_SIZE
     The ARCTWO block-size, 8.

 -- Constant: ARCTWO_MIN_KEY_SIZE

 -- Constant: ARCTWO_MAX_KEY_SIZE

 -- Constant: ARCTWO_KEY_SIZE
     Default ARCTWO key size, 8.

 -- Function: void arctwo_set_key_ekb (struct arctwo_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY, unsigned EKB)
 -- Function: void arctwo_set_key (struct arctwo_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void arctwo_set_key_gutmann (struct arctwo_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption. The first function is the most general
     one, which lets you provide both the variable size key, and the
     desired effective key size (in bits). The maximum value for EKB is
     1024, and for convenience, `ekb = 0' has the same effect as `ekb =
     1024'.

     `arctwo_set_key(ctx, length, key)' is equivalent to
     `arctwo_set_key_ekb(ctx, length, key, 8*length)', and
     `arctwo_set_key_gutmann(ctx, length, key)' is equivalent to
     `arctwo_set_key_ekb(ctx, length, key, 1024)'

 -- Function: void arctwo_encrypt (struct arctwo_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encryption function. LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the
     block size. If it is more than one block, the data is processed in
     ECB mode. `src' and `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap
     in any other way.

 -- Function: void arctwo_decrypt (struct arctwo_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Analogous to `arctwo_encrypt'

6.2.4 BLOWFISH
--------------

BLOWFISH is a block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier. It uses a block
size of 64 bits (8 octets), and a variable key size, up to 448 bits. It
has some weak keys. Nettle defines BLOWFISH in `<nettle/blowfish.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct blowfish_ctx

 -- Constant: BLOWFISH_BLOCK_SIZE
     The BLOWFISH block-size, 8.

 -- Constant: BLOWFISH_MIN_KEY_SIZE
     Minimum BLOWFISH key size, 8.

 -- Constant: BLOWFISH_MAX_KEY_SIZE
     Maximum BLOWFISH key size, 56.

 -- Constant: BLOWFISH_KEY_SIZE
     Default BLOWFISH key size, 16.

 -- Function: int blowfish_set_key (struct blowfish_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption. Checks for weak keys, returning 1 for
     good keys and 0 for weak keys. Applications that don't care about
     weak keys can ignore the return value.

     `blowfish_encrypt' or `blowfish_decrypt' with a weak key will
     crash with an assert violation.

 -- Function: void blowfish_encrypt (struct blowfish_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encryption function. LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the
     block size. If it is more than one block, the data is processed in
     ECB mode. `src' and `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap
     in any other way.

 -- Function: void blowfish_decrypt (struct blowfish_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Analogous to `blowfish_encrypt'

6.2.5 Camellia
--------------

Camellia is a block cipher developed by Mitsubishi and Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corporation, described in `RFC3713'. It is recommended by
some Japanese and European authorities as an alternative to AES, and it
is one of the selected algorithms in the New European Schemes for
Signatures, Integrity and Encryption (NESSIE) project. The algorithm is
patented. The implementation in Nettle is derived from the
implementation released by NTT under the GNU LGPL (v2.1 or later), and
relies on the implicit patent license of the LGPL. There is also a
statement of royalty-free licensing for Camellia at
`http://www.ntt.co.jp/news/news01e/0104/010417.html', but this
statement has some limitations which seem problematic for free software.

   Camellia uses a the same block size and key sizes as AES: The block
size is 128 bits (16 octets), and the supported key sizes are 128, 192,
and 256 bits. The variants with 192 and 256 bit keys are identical,
except for the key setup. Nettle defines Camellia in
`<nettle/camellia.h>', and there is one context struct for each key
size. (Earlier versions of Nettle used a single context struct, `struct
camellia_ctx', for all key sizes. This interface kept for backwards
compatibility).

 -- Context struct: struct camellia128_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct camellia192_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct camellia256_ctx
     Contexts structs. Actually, `camellia192_ctx' is an alias for
     `camellia256_ctx'.

 -- Context struct: struct camellia_ctx
     Alternative struct, for the old Camellia interface.

 -- Constant: CAMELLIA_BLOCK_SIZE
     The CAMELLIA block-size, 16.

 -- Constant: CAMELLIA128_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: CAMELLIA192_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: CAMELLIA256_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: CAMELLIA_MIN_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: CAMELLIA_MAX_KEY_SIZE

 -- Constant: CAMELLIA_KEY_SIZE
     Default CAMELLIA key size, 32.

 -- Function: void camellia128_set_encrypt_key (struct camellia128_ctx
          *CTX, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void camellia128_set_decrypt_key (struct camellia128_ctx
          *CTX, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void camellia192_set_encrypt_key (struct camellia192_ctx
          *CTX, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void camellia192_set_decrypt_key (struct camellia192_ctx
          *CTX, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void camellia256_set_encrypt_key (struct camellia256_ctx
          *CTX, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void camellia256_set_decrypt_key (struct camellia256_ctx
          *CTX, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void camellia_set_encrypt_key (struct camellia_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void camellia_set_decrypt_key (struct camellia_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher, for encryption or decryption, respectively.

 -- Function: void camellia128_invert_key (struct camellia128_ctx *DST,
          const struct camellia128_ctx *SRC)
 -- Function: void camellia192_invert_key (struct camellia192_ctx *DST,
          const struct camellia192_ctx *SRC)
 -- Function: void camellia256_invert_key (struct camellia256_ctx *DST,
          const struct camellia256_ctx *SRC)
 -- Function: void camellia_invert_key (struct camellia_ctx *DST, const
          struct camellia_ctx *SRC)
     Given a context SRC initialized for encryption, initializes the
     context struct DST for decryption, using the same key. If the same
     context struct is passed for both `src' and `dst', it is converted
     in place. These functions are mainly useful for applications which
     needs to both encrypt and decrypt using the _same_ key.

 -- Function: void camellia128_crypt (struct camellia128_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void camellia192_crypt (struct camellia192_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void camellia256_crypt (struct camellia256_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void camellia_crypt (struct camellia_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     The same function is used for both encryption and decryption.
     LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the block size. If it is
     more than one block, the data is processed in ECB mode. `src' and
     `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap in any other way.

6.2.6 CAST128
-------------

CAST-128 is a block cipher, specified in `RFC 2144'. It uses a 64 bit
(8 octets) block size, and a variable key size of up to 128 bits.
Nettle defines cast128 in `<nettle/cast128.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct cast128_ctx

 -- Constant: CAST128_BLOCK_SIZE
     The CAST128 block-size, 8.

 -- Constant: CAST128_MIN_KEY_SIZE
     Minimum CAST128 key size, 5.

 -- Constant: CAST128_MAX_KEY_SIZE
     Maximum CAST128 key size, 16.

 -- Constant: CAST128_KEY_SIZE
     Default CAST128 key size, 16.

 -- Function: void cast128_set_key (struct cast128_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption.

 -- Function: void cast128_encrypt (struct cast128_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encryption function. LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the
     block size. If it is more than one block, the data is processed in
     ECB mode. `src' and `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap
     in any other way.

 -- Function: void cast128_decrypt (struct cast128_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Analogous to `cast128_encrypt'

6.2.7 ChaCha
------------

ChaCha is a variant of the stream cipher Salsa20, also designed by D. J.
Bernstein. For more information on Salsa20, see below. Nettle defines
ChaCha in `<nettle/chacha.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct chacha_ctx

 -- Constant: CHACHA_KEY_SIZE
     ChaCha key size, 32.

 -- Constant: CHACHA_BLOCK_SIZE
     ChaCha block size, 64.

 -- Constant: CHACHA_NONCE_SIZE
     Size of the nonce, 8.

 -- Function: void chacha_set_key (struct chacha_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption. Before using the cipher, you _must_
     also call `chacha_set_nonce', see below.

 -- Function: void chacha_set_nonce (struct chacha_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *NONCE)
     Sets the nonce. It is always of size `CHACHA_NONCE_SIZE', 8
     octets. This function also initializes the block counter, setting
     it to zero.

 -- Function: void chacha_crypt (struct chacha_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encrypts or decrypts the data of a message, using ChaCha. When a
     message is encrypted using a sequence of calls to `chacha_crypt',
     all but the last call _must_ use a length that is a multiple of
     `CHACHA_BLOCK_SIZE'.

6.2.8 DES
---------

DES is the old Data Encryption Standard, specified by NIST. It uses a
block size of 64 bits (8 octets), and a key size of 56 bits. However,
the key bits are distributed over 8 octets, where the least significant
bit of each octet may be used for parity. A common way to use DES is to
generate 8 random octets in some way, then set the least significant bit
of each octet to get odd parity, and initialize DES with the resulting
key.

   The key size of DES is so small that keys can be found by brute
force, using specialized hardware or lots of ordinary work stations in
parallel. One shouldn't be using plain DES at all today, if one uses
DES at all one should be using "triple DES", see DES3 below.

   DES also has some weak keys. Nettle defines DES in `<nettle/des.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct des_ctx

 -- Constant: DES_BLOCK_SIZE
     The DES block-size, 8.

 -- Constant: DES_KEY_SIZE
     DES key size, 8.

 -- Function: int des_set_key (struct des_ctx *CTX, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption. Parity bits are ignored. Checks for
     weak keys, returning 1 for good keys and 0 for weak keys.
     Applications that don't care about weak keys can ignore the return
     value.

 -- Function: void des_encrypt (struct des_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encryption function. LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the
     block size. If it is more than one block, the data is processed in
     ECB mode. `src' and `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap
     in any other way.

 -- Function: void des_decrypt (struct des_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Analogous to `des_encrypt'

 -- Function: int des_check_parity (size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY);
     Checks that the given key has correct, odd, parity. Returns 1 for
     correct parity, and 0 for bad parity.

 -- Function: void des_fix_parity (size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const
          uint8_t *SRC)
     Adjusts the parity bits to match DES's requirements. You need this
     function if you have created a random-looking string by a key
     agreement protocol, and want to use it as a DES key. DST and SRC
     may be equal.

6.2.9 DES3
----------

The inadequate key size of DES has already been mentioned. One way to
increase the key size is to pipe together several DES boxes with
independent keys. It turns out that using two DES ciphers is not as
secure as one might think, even if the key size of the combination is a
respectable 112 bits.

   The standard way to increase DES's key size is to use three DES
boxes.  The mode of operation is a little peculiar: the middle DES box
is wired in the reverse direction. To encrypt a block with DES3, you
encrypt it using the first 56 bits of the key, then _decrypt_ it using
the middle 56 bits of the key, and finally encrypt it again using the
last 56 bits of the key. This is known as "ede" triple-DES, for
"encrypt-decrypt-encrypt".

   The "ede" construction provides some backward compatibility, as you
get plain single DES simply by feeding the same key to all three boxes.
That should help keeping down the gate count, and the price, of hardware
circuits implementing both plain DES and DES3.

   DES3 has a key size of 168 bits, but just like plain DES, useless
parity bits are inserted, so that keys are represented as 24 octets
(192 bits).  As a 112 bit key is large enough to make brute force
attacks impractical, some applications uses a "two-key" variant of
triple-DES.  In this mode, the same key bits are used for the first and
the last DES box in the pipe, while the middle box is keyed
independently. The two-key variant is believed to be secure, i.e. there
are no known attacks significantly better than brute force.

   Naturally, it's simple to implement triple-DES on top of Nettle's DES
functions. Nettle includes an implementation of three-key "ede"
triple-DES, it is defined in the same place as plain DES,
`<nettle/des.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct des3_ctx

 -- Constant: DES3_BLOCK_SIZE
     The DES3 block-size is the same as DES_BLOCK_SIZE, 8.

 -- Constant: DES3_KEY_SIZE
     DES key size, 24.

 -- Function: int des3_set_key (struct des3_ctx *CTX, const uint8_t
          *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption. Parity bits are ignored. Checks for
     weak keys, returning 1 if all three keys are good keys, and 0 if
     one or more key is weak.  Applications that don't care about weak
     keys can ignore the return value.

   For random-looking strings, you can use `des_fix_parity' to adjust
the parity bits before calling `des3_set_key'.

 -- Function: void des3_encrypt (struct des3_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encryption function. LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the
     block size. If it is more than one block, the data is processed in
     ECB mode. `src' and `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap
     in any other way.

 -- Function: void des3_decrypt (struct des3_ctx *CTX, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Analogous to `des_encrypt'

6.2.10 Salsa20
--------------

Salsa20 is a fairly recent stream cipher designed by D. J. Bernstein. It
is built on the observation that a cryptographic hash function can be
used for encryption: Form the hash input from the secret key and a
counter, xor the hash output and the first block of the plaintext, then
increment the counter to process the next block (similar to CTR mode,
see *note CTR::). Bernstein defined an encryption algorithm, Snuffle,
in this way to ridicule United States export restrictions which treated
hash functions as nice and harmless, but ciphers as dangerous munitions.

   Salsa20 uses the same idea, but with a new specialized hash function
to mix key, block counter, and a couple of constants. It's also designed
for speed; on x86_64, it is currently the fastest cipher offered by
nettle. It uses a block size of 512 bits (64 octets) and there are two
specified key sizes, 128 and 256 bits (16 and 32 octets).

   *Caution:* The hash function used in Salsa20 is _not_ directly
applicable for use as a general hash function. It's _not_ collision
resistant if arbitrary inputs are allowed, and furthermore, the input
and output is of fixed size.

   When using Salsa20 to process a message, one specifies both a key
and a "nonce", the latter playing a similar rôle to the initialization
vector (IV) used with CBC or CTR mode. One can use the same key for
several messages, provided one uses a unique random iv for each
message. The iv is 64 bits (8 octets). The block counter is initialized
to zero for each message, and is also 64 bits (8 octets). Nettle
defines Salsa20 in `<nettle/salsa20.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct salsa20_ctx

 -- Constant: SALSA20_128_KEY_SIZE
 -- Constant: SALSA20_256_KEY_SIZE
     The two supported key sizes, 16 and 32 octets.

 -- Constant: SALSA20_KEY_SIZE
     Recommended key size, 32.

 -- Constant: SALSA20_BLOCK_SIZE
     Salsa20 block size, 64.

 -- Constant: SALSA20_NONCE_SIZE
     Size of the nonce, 8.

 -- Function: void salsa20_128_set_key (struct salsa20_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void salsa20_256_set_key (struct salsa20_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void salsa20_set_key (struct salsa20_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption. `salsa20_128_set_key' and
     `salsa20_128_set_key' use a fix key size each, 16 and 32 octets,
     respectively. The function `salsa20_set_key' is provided for
     backwards compatibility, and the LENGTH argument must be either 16
     or 32. Before using the cipher, you _must_ also call
     `salsa20_set_nonce', see below.

 -- Function: void salsa20_set_nonce (struct salsa20_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *NONCE)
     Sets the nonce. It is always of size `SALSA20_NONCE_SIZE', 8
     octets. This function also initializes the block counter, setting
     it to zero.

 -- Function: void salsa20_crypt (struct salsa20_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encrypts or decrypts the data of a message, using salsa20. When a
     message is encrypted using a sequence of calls to `salsa20_crypt',
     all but the last call _must_ use a length that is a multiple of
     `SALSA20_BLOCK_SIZE'.

   The full salsa20 cipher uses 20 rounds of mixing. Variants of Salsa20
with fewer rounds are possible, and the 12-round variant is specified by
eSTREAM, see `http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/finallist.html'.  Nettle
calls this variant `salsa20r12'. It uses the same context struct and
key setup as the full salsa20 cipher, but a separate function for
encryption and decryption.

 -- Function: void salsa20r12_crypt (struct salsa20_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encrypts or decrypts the data of a message, using salsa20 reduced
     to 12 rounds.

6.2.11 SERPENT
--------------

SERPENT is one of the AES finalists, designed by Ross Anderson, Eli
Biham and Lars Knudsen. Thus, the interface and properties are similar
to AES'. One peculiarity is that it is quite pointless to use it with
anything but the maximum key size, smaller keys are just padded to
larger ones. Nettle defines SERPENT in `<nettle/serpent.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct serpent_ctx

 -- Constant: SERPENT_BLOCK_SIZE
     The SERPENT block-size, 16.

 -- Constant: SERPENT_MIN_KEY_SIZE
     Minimum SERPENT key size, 16.

 -- Constant: SERPENT_MAX_KEY_SIZE
     Maximum SERPENT key size, 32.

 -- Constant: SERPENT_KEY_SIZE
     Default SERPENT key size, 32.

 -- Function: void serpent_set_key (struct serpent_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption.

 -- Function: void serpent_encrypt (struct serpent_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encryption function. LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the
     block size. If it is more than one block, the data is processed in
     ECB mode. `src' and `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap
     in any other way.

 -- Function: void serpent_decrypt (struct serpent_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Analogous to `serpent_encrypt'

6.2.12 TWOFISH
--------------

Another AES finalist, this one designed by Bruce Schneier and others.
Nettle defines it in `<nettle/twofish.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct twofish_ctx

 -- Constant: TWOFISH_BLOCK_SIZE
     The TWOFISH block-size, 16.

 -- Constant: TWOFISH_MIN_KEY_SIZE
     Minimum TWOFISH key size, 16.

 -- Constant: TWOFISH_MAX_KEY_SIZE
     Maximum TWOFISH key size, 32.

 -- Constant: TWOFISH_KEY_SIZE
     Default TWOFISH key size, 32.

 -- Function: void twofish_set_key (struct twofish_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the cipher. The same function is used for both
     encryption and decryption.

 -- Function: void twofish_encrypt (struct twofish_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encryption function. LENGTH must be an integral multiple of the
     block size. If it is more than one block, the data is processed in
     ECB mode. `src' and `dst' may be equal, but they must not overlap
     in any other way.

 -- Function: void twofish_decrypt (struct twofish_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Analogous to `twofish_encrypt'

6.2.13 The `struct nettle_cipher' abstraction
---------------------------------------------

Nettle includes a struct including information about some of the more
regular cipher functions. It can be useful for applications that need a
simple way to handle various algorithms. Nettle defines these structs in
`<nettle/nettle-meta.h>'.

 -- Meta struct: `struct nettle_cipher' name context_size block_size
          key_size set_encrypt_key set_decrypt_key encrypt decrypt
     The last four attributes are function pointers, of types
     `nettle_set_key_func *' and `nettle_cipher_func *'. The first
     argument to these functions is a `const void *' pointer to a
     context struct, which is of size `context_size'.

 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_cipher nettle_aes128
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_cipher nettle_aes192
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_cipher nettle_aes256
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_cipher nettle_arctwo40

 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_cipher nettle_twofish128
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_cipher nettle_twofish192
 -- Constant Struct: struct nettle_cipher nettle_twofish256
     Nettle includes such structs for all the _regular_ ciphers, i.e.
     ones without weak keys or other oddities.

   Nettle also exports a list of all these ciphers without weak keys or
other oddities.

 -- Constant Array: struct nettle_cipher ** nettle_ciphers
     This list can be used to dynamically enumerate or search the
     supported algorithms. NULL-terminated.

Cipher modes of operation specifies the procedure to use when encrypting
a message that is larger than the cipher's block size. As explained in
*Note Cipher functions::, splitting the message into blocks and
processing them independently with the block cipher (Electronic Code
Book mode, ECB), leaks information.

   Besides ECB, Nettle provides a two other modes of operation: Cipher
Block Chaining (CBC), Counter mode (CTR), and a couple of AEAD modes
(*note Authenticated encryption::).  CBC is widely used, but there are
a few subtle issues of information leakage, see, e.g., SSH CBC
vulnerability (http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/958563). Today, CTR is
usually preferred over CBC.

   Modes like CBC and CTR provide _no_ message authentication, and
should always be used together with a MAC (*note Keyed hash
functions::) or signature to authenticate the message.

6.3.1 Cipher Block Chaining
---------------------------

When using CBC mode, plaintext blocks are not encrypted independently
of each other, like in Electronic Cook Book mode. Instead, when
encrypting a block in CBC mode, the previous ciphertext block is XORed
with the plaintext before it is fed to the block cipher.  When
encrypting the first block, a random block called an "IV", or
Initialization Vector, is used as the "previous ciphertext block". The
IV should be chosen randomly, but it need not be kept secret, and can
even be transmitted in the clear together with the encrypted data.

   In symbols, if `E_k' is the encryption function of a block cipher,
and `IV' is the initialization vector, then `n' plaintext blocks
`M_1',... `M_n' are transformed into `n' ciphertext blocks `C_1',...
`C_n' as follows:

     C_1 = E_k(IV  XOR M_1)
     C_2 = E_k(C_1 XOR M_2)

     ...

     C_n = E_k(C_(n-1) XOR M_n)

   Nettle's includes two functions for applying a block cipher in Cipher
Block Chaining (CBC) mode, one for encryption and one for decryption.
These functions uses `void *' to pass cipher contexts around.

 -- Function: void cbc_encrypt (const void *CTX, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t BLOCK_SIZE, uint8_t *IV, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST,
          const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void cbc_decrypt (const void *CTX, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t BLOCK_SIZE, uint8_t *IV, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST,
          const uint8_t *SRC)
     Applies the encryption or decryption function F in CBC mode. The
     final ciphertext block processed is copied into IV before
     returning, so that large message be processed be a sequence of
     calls to `cbc_encrypt'. The function F is of type

     `void f (void *CTX, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t DST, const uint8_t
     *SRC)',

     and the `cbc_encrypt' and `cbc_decrypt' functions pass their
     argument CTX on to F.

   There are also some macros to help use these functions correctly.

 -- Macro: CBC_CTX (CONTEXT_TYPE, BLOCK_SIZE)
     Expands to
          {
             context_type ctx;
             uint8_t iv[block_size];
          }

   It can be used to define a CBC context struct, either directly,

     struct CBC_CTX(struct aes_ctx, AES_BLOCK_SIZE) ctx;

   or to give it a struct tag,

     struct aes_cbc_ctx CBC_CTX (struct aes_ctx, AES_BLOCK_SIZE);

 -- Macro: CBC_SET_IV (CTX, IV)
     First argument is a pointer to a context struct as defined by
     `CBC_CTX', and the second is a pointer to an Initialization Vector
     (IV) that is copied into that context.

 -- Macro: CBC_ENCRYPT (CTX, F, LENGTH, DST, SRC)
 -- Macro: CBC_DECRYPT (CTX, F, LENGTH, DST, SRC)
     A simpler way to invoke `cbc_encrypt' and `cbc_decrypt'. The first
     argument is a pointer to a context struct as defined by `CBC_CTX',
     and the second argument is an encryption or decryption function
     following Nettle's conventions. The last three arguments define
     the source and destination area for the operation.

   These macros use some tricks to make the compiler display a warning
if the types of F and CTX don't match, e.g. if you try to use an
`struct aes_ctx' context with the `des_encrypt' function.

6.3.2 Counter mode
------------------

Counter mode (CTR) uses the block cipher as a keyed pseudo-random
generator. The output of the generator is XORed with the data to be
encrypted. It can be understood as a way to transform a block cipher to
a stream cipher.

   The message is divided into `n' blocks `M_1',...  `M_n', where `M_n'
is of size `m' which may be smaller than the block size. Except for the
last block, all the message blocks must be of size equal to the
cipher's block size.

   If `E_k' is the encryption function of a block cipher, `IC' is the
initial counter, then the `n' plaintext blocks are transformed into `n'
ciphertext blocks `C_1',...  `C_n' as follows:

     C_1 = E_k(IC) XOR M_1
     C_2 = E_k(IC + 1) XOR M_2

     ...

     C_(n-1) = E_k(IC + n - 2) XOR M_(n-1)
     C_n = E_k(IC + n - 1) [1..m] XOR M_n

   The IC is the initial value for the counter, it plays a similar rôle
as the IV for CBC. When adding, `IC + x', IC is interpreted as an
integer, in network byte order. For the last block, `E_k(IC + n - 1)
[1..m]' means that the cipher output is truncated to `m' bytes.

 -- Function: void ctr_crypt (const void *CTX, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t BLOCK_SIZE, uint8_t *CTR, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST,
          const uint8_t *SRC)
     Applies the encryption function F in CTR mode. Note that for CTR
     mode, encryption and decryption is the same operation, and hence F
     should always be the encryption function for the underlying block
     cipher.

     When a message is encrypted using a sequence of calls to
     `ctr_crypt', all but the last call _must_ use a length that is a
     multiple of the block size.

   Like for CBC, there are also a couple of helper macros.

 -- Macro: CTR_CTX (CONTEXT_TYPE, BLOCK_SIZE)
     Expands to
          {
             context_type ctx;
             uint8_t ctr[block_size];
          }

 -- Macro: CTR_SET_COUNTER (CTX, IV)
     First argument is a pointer to a context struct as defined by
     `CTR_CTX', and the second is a pointer to an initial counter that
     is copied into that context.

 -- Macro: CTR_CRYPT (CTX, F, LENGTH, DST, SRC)
     A simpler way to invoke `ctr_crypt'. The first argument is a
     pointer to a context struct as defined by `CTR_CTX', and the second
     argument is an encryption function following Nettle's conventions.
     The last three arguments define the source and destination area
     for the operation.

6.4 Authenticated encryption with associated data
=================================================

Since there are some subtle design choices to be made when combining a
block cipher mode with out authentication with a MAC. In recent years,
several constructions that combine encryption and authentication have
been defined. These constructions typically also have an additional
input, the "associated data", which is authenticated but not included
with the message. A simple example is an implicit message number which
is available at both sender and receiver, and which needs
authentication in order to detect deletions or replay of messages. This
family of building blocks are therefore called AEAD, Authenticated
encryption with associated data.

   The aim is to provide building blocks that it is easier for
designers of protocols and applications to use correctly. There is also
some potential for improved performance, if encryption and
authentication can be done in a single step, although that potential is
not realized for the constructions currently supported by Nettle.

   For encryption, the inputs are:

   * The key, which can be used for many messages.

   * A nonce, which must be unique for each message using the same key.

   * Additional associated data to be authenticated, but not included
     in the message.

   * The cleartext message to be encrypted.

   The outputs are:

   * The ciphertext, of the same size as the cleartext.

   * A digest or "authentication tag".

   Decryption works the same, but with cleartext and ciphertext
interchanged. All currently supported AEAD algorithms always use the
encryption function of the underlying block cipher, for both encryption
and decryption.

   Usually, the authentication tag should be appended at the end of the
ciphertext, producing an encrypted message which is slightly longer than
the cleartext. However, Nettle's low level AEAD functions produce the
authentication tag as a separate output for both encryption and
decryption.

   Both associated data and the message data (cleartext or ciphertext)
can be processed incrementally. In general, all associated data must be
processed before the message data, and all calls but the last one must
use a length that is a multiple of he block size, although some AEAD
may implement more liberal conventions. The CCM mode is a bit special
in that it requires the message lengths up front, other AEAD
constructions don't have this restriction.

   The supported AEAD constructions are Galois/Counter mode (GCM), EAX,
ChaCha-Poly1305, and Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM). There are some
weaknesses in GCM authentication, see
`http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/comments/CWC-GCM/Ferguson2.pdf'.
CCM and EAX use the same building blocks, but the EAX design is cleaner
and avoids a couple of inconveniences of CCM. Therefore, EAX seems like
a good conservative choice. The more recent ChaCha-Poly1305 may also be
an attractive but more adventurous alternative, in particular if
performance is important.

6.4.1 EAX
---------

The EAX mode is an AEAD mode whichcombines CTR mode encryption, *Note
CTR::, with a message authentication based on CBC, *Note CBC::. The
implementation in Nettle is restricted to ciphers with a block size of
128 bits (16 octets).  EAX was defined as a reaction to the CCM mode,
*Note CCM::, which uses the same primitives but has some undesirable and
inelegant properties.

   EAX supports arbitrary nonce size; it's even possible to use an
empty nonce in case only a single message is encrypted for each key.

   Nettle's support for EAX consists of a low-level general interface,
some convenience macros, and specific functions for EAX using AES-128
as the underlying cipher. These interfaces are defined in
`<nettle/eax.h>'

6.4.1.1 General EAX interface
.............................

 -- Context struct: struct eax_key
     EAX state which depends only on the key, but not on the nonce or
     the message.

 -- Context struct: struct eax_ctx
     Holds state corresponding to a particular message.

 -- Constant: EAX_BLOCK_SIZE
     EAX's block size, 16.

 -- Constant: EAX_DIGEST_SIZE
     Size of the EAX digest, also 16.

 -- Function: void eax_set_key (struct eax_key *KEY, const void
          *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F)
     Initializes KEY. CIPHER gives a context struct for the underlying
     cipher, which must have been previously initialized for
     encryption, and F is the encryption function.

 -- Function: void eax_set_nonce (struct eax_ctx *EAX, const struct
          eax_key *KEY, const void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t NONCE_LENGTH, const uint8_t *NONCE)
     Initializes CTX for processing a new message, using the given
     nonce.

 -- Function: void eax_update (struct eax_ctx *EAX, const struct
          eax_key *KEY, const void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t DATA_LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Process associated data for authentication. All but the last call
     for each message _must_ use a length that is a multiple of the
     block size. Unlike many other AEAD constructions, for EAX it's not
     necessary to complete the processing of all associated data before
     encrypting or decrypting the message data.

 -- Function: void eax_encrypt (struct eax_ctx *EAX, const struct
          eax_key *KEY, const void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void eax_decrypt (struct eax_ctx *EAX, const struct
          eax_key *KEY, const void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encrypts or decrypts the data of a message. CIPHER is the context
     struct for the underlying cipher and F is the encryption function.
     All but the last call for each message _must_ use a length that is
     a multiple of the block size.

 -- Function: void eax_digest (struct eax_ctx *EAX, const struct
          eax_key *KEY, const void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST);
     Extracts the message digest (also known "authentication tag").
     This is the final operation when processing a message. If LENGTH is
     smaller than `EAX_DIGEST_SIZE', only the first LENGTH octets of
     the digest are written.

6.4.1.2 EAX helper macros
.........................

The following macros are defined.

 -- Macro: EAX_CTX (CONTEXT_TYPE)
     This defines an all-in-one context struct, including the context
     of the underlying cipher and all EAX state. It expands to
          {
             struct eax_key key;
             struct eax_ctx eax;
             context_type cipher;
          }

   For all these macros, CTX, is a context struct as defined by
`EAX_CTX', and ENCRYPT is the encryption function of the underlying
cipher.

 -- Macro: EAX_SET_KEY (CTX, SET_KEY, ENCRYPT, KEY)
     SET_KEY is the function for setting the encryption key for the
     underlying cipher, and KEY is the key.

 -- Macro: EAX_SET_NONCE (CTX, ENCRYPT, LENGTH, NONCE)
     Sets the nonce to be used for the message.

 -- Macro: EAX_UPDATE (CTX, ENCRYPT, LENGTH, DATA)
     Process associated data for authentication.

 -- Macro: EAX_ENCRYPT (CTX, ENCRYPT, LENGTH, DST, SRC)
 -- Macro: EAX_DECRYPT (CTX, ENCRYPT, LENGTH, DST, SRC)
     Process message data for encryption or decryption.

 -- Macro: EAX_DIGEST (CTX, ENCRYPT, LENGTH, DIGEST)
     Extract te authentication tag for the message.

6.4.1.3 EAX-AES128 interface
............................

The following functions implement EAX using AES-128 as the underlying
cipher.

 -- Context struct: struct eax_aes128_ctx
     The context struct, defined using `EAX_CTX'.

 -- Function: void eax_aes128_set_key (struct eax_aes128_ctx *CTX,
          const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initializes CTX using the given key.

 -- Function: void eax_aes128_set_nonce (struct eax_aes128_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *IV)
     Initializes the per-message state, using the given nonce.

 -- Function: void eax_aes128_update (struct eax_aes128_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Process associated data for authentication. All but the last call
     for each message _must_ use a length that is a multiple of the
     block size.

 -- Function: void eax_aes128_encrypt (struct eax_aes128_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void eax_aes128_decrypt (struct eax_aes128_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encrypts or decrypts the data of a message. All but the last call
     for each message _must_ use a length that is a multiple of the
     block size.

 -- Function: void eax_aes128_digest (struct eax_aes128_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST);
     Extracts the message digest (also known "authentication tag").
     This is the final operation when processing a message. If LENGTH is
     smaller than `EAX_DIGEST_SIZE', only the first LENGTH octets of
     the digest are written.

6.4.2 Galois counter mode
-------------------------

Galois counter mode is an AEAD constructions combining counter mode
with message authentication based on universal hashing. The main
objective of the design is to provide high performance for hardware
implementations, where other popular MAC algorithms (*note Keyed hash
functions::) become a bottleneck for high-speed hardware
implementations. It was proposed by David A. McGrew and John Viega in
2005, and recommended by NIST in 2007, NIST Special Publication 800-38D
(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38D/SP-800-38D.pdf). It
is constructed on top of a block cipher which must have a block size of
128 bits.

   The authentication in GCM has some known weaknesses, see
`http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/comments/CWC-GCM/Ferguson2.pdf'.
In particular, don't use GCM with short authentication tags.

   Nettle's support for GCM consists of a low-level general interface,
some convenience macros, and specific functions for GCM using AES or
Camellia as the underlying cipher.  These interfaces are defined in
`<nettle/gcm.h>'

6.4.2.1 General GCM interface
.............................

 -- Context struct: struct gcm_key
     Message independent hash sub-key, and related tables.

 -- Context struct: struct gcm_ctx
     Holds state corresponding to a particular message.

 -- Constant: GCM_BLOCK_SIZE
     GCM's block size, 16.

 -- Constant: GCM_DIGEST_SIZE
     Size of the GCM digest, also 16.

 -- Constant: GCM_IV_SIZE
     Recommended size of the IV, 12. Arbitrary sizes are allowed.

 -- Function: void gcm_set_key (struct gcm_key *KEY, const void
          *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F)
     Initializes KEY. CIPHER gives a context struct for the underlying
     cipher, which must have been previously initialized for
     encryption, and F is the encryption function.

 -- Function: void gcm_set_iv (struct gcm_ctx *CTX, const struct
          gcm_key *KEY, size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *IV)
     Initializes CTX using the given IV. The KEY argument is actually
     needed only if LENGTH differs from `GCM_IV_SIZE'.

 -- Function: void gcm_update (struct gcm_ctx *CTX, const struct
          gcm_key *KEY, size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Provides associated data to be authenticated. If used, must be
     called before `gcm_encrypt' or `gcm_decrypt'. All but the last call
     for each message _must_ use a length that is a multiple of the
     block size.

 -- Function: void gcm_encrypt (struct gcm_ctx *CTX, const struct
          gcm_key *KEY, const void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void gcm_decrypt (struct gcm_ctx *CTX, const struct
          gcm_key *KEY, const void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encrypts or decrypts the data of a message. CIPHER is the context
     struct for the underlying cipher and F is the encryption function.
     All but the last call for each message _must_ use a length that is
     a multiple of the block size.

 -- Function: void gcm_digest (struct gcm_ctx *CTX, const struct
          gcm_key *KEY, const void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Extracts the message digest (also known "authentication tag").
     This is the final operation when processing a message. It's
     strongly recommended that LENGTH is `GCM_DIGEST_SIZE', but if you
     provide a smaller value, only the first LENGTH octets of the
     digest are written.

   To encrypt a message using GCM, first initialize a context for the
underlying block cipher with a key to use for encryption. Then call the
above functions in the following order: `gcm_set_key', `gcm_set_iv',
`gcm_update', `gcm_encrypt', `gcm_digest'. The decryption procedure is
analogous, just calling `gcm_decrypt' instead of `gcm_encrypt' (note
that GCM decryption still uses the encryption function of the
underlying block cipher). To process a new message, using the same key,
call `gcm_set_iv' with a new iv.

6.4.2.2 GCM helper macros
.........................

The following macros are defined.

 -- Macro: GCM_CTX (CONTEXT_TYPE)
     This defines an all-in-one context struct, including the context
     of the underlying cipher, the hash sub-key, and the per-message
     state. It expands to
          {
             struct gcm_key key;
             struct gcm_ctx gcm;
             context_type cipher;
          }

   Example use:
     struct gcm_aes128_ctx GCM_CTX(struct aes128_ctx);

   The following macros operate on context structs of this form.

 -- Macro: GCM_SET_KEY (CTX, SET_KEY, ENCRYPT, KEY)
     First argument, CTX, is a context struct as defined by `GCM_CTX'.
     SET_KEY and ENCRYPT are functions for setting the encryption key
     and for encrypting data using the underlying cipher.

 -- Macro: GCM_SET_IV (CTX, LENGTH, DATA)
     First argument is a context struct as defined by `GCM_CTX'. LENGTH
     and DATA give the initialization vector (IV).

 -- Macro: GCM_UPDATE (CTX, LENGTH, DATA)
     Simpler way to call `gcm_update'. First argument is a context
     struct as defined by `GCM_CTX'

 -- Macro: GCM_ENCRYPT (CTX, ENCRYPT, LENGTH, DST, SRC)
 -- Macro: GCM_DECRYPT (CTX, ENCRYPT, LENGTH, DST, SRC)
 -- Macro: GCM_DIGEST (CTX, ENCRYPT, LENGTH, DIGEST)
     Simpler way to call `gcm_encrypt', `gcm_decrypt' or `gcm_digest'.
     First argument is a context struct as defined by `GCM_CTX'. Second
     argument, ENCRYPT, is the encryption function of the underlying
     cipher.

6.4.2.3 GCM-AES interface
.........................

The following functions implement the common case of GCM using AES as
the underlying cipher. The variants with a specific AES flavor are
recommended, while the fucntinos using `struct gcm_aes_ctx' are kept
for compatibility with older versiosn of Nettle.

 -- Context struct: struct gcm_aes128_ctx

          const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initializes CTX using the given key.

 -- Function: void gcm_aes_set_key (struct gcm_aes_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *KEY)
     Corresponding function, using the old AES interface. All valid AES
     key sizes can be used.

 -- Function: void gcm_aes128_set_iv (struct gcm_aes128_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *IV)

 -- Function: void gcm_aes_set_iv (struct gcm_aes_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *IV)
     Initializes the per-message state, using the given IV.

 -- Function: void gcm_aes128_update (struct gcm_aes128_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
 -- Function: void gcm_aes192_update (struct gcm_aes192_ctx *CTX,

          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
 -- Function: void gcm_aes_update (struct gcm_aes_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Provides associated data to be authenticated. If used, must be
     called before `gcm_aes_encrypt' or `gcm_aes_decrypt'. All but the
     last call for each message _must_ use a length that is a multiple
     of the block size.

6.4.3 Counter with CBC-MAC mode
-------------------------------

CCM mode is a combination of counter mode with message authentication
based on cipher block chaining, the same building blocks as EAX, *note
EAX::. It is constructed on top of a block cipher which must have a
block size of 128 bits. CCM mode is recommended by NIST in NIST Special
Publication 800-38C
(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38C/SP800-38C_updated-July20_2007.pdf).
Nettle's support for CCM consists of a low-level general interface, a
message encryption and authentication interface, and specific functions
for CCM using AES as the underlying block cipher. These interfaces are
defined in `<nettle/ccm.h>'.

   In CCM, the length of the message must be known before processing.
The maximum message size depends on the size of the nonce, since the
message size is encoded in a field which must fit in a single block,
together with the nonce and a flag byte. E.g., with a nonce size of 12
octets, there are three octets left for encoding the message length,
the maximum message length is 2^24 - 1 octets.

   CCM mode encryption operates as follows:
   * The nonce and message length are concatenated to create `B_0 =
     flags | nonce | mlength'

   * The authenticated data and plaintext is formatted into the string
     `B = L(adata) | adata | padding | plaintext | padding' with
     `padding' being the shortest string of zero bytes such that the
     length of the string is a multiple of the block size, and
     `L(adata)' is an encoding of the length of `adata'.

   * The string `B' is separated into blocks `B_1' ...  `B_n'

   * The authentication tag `T' is calculated as `T=0, for i=0 to n, do
     T = E_k(B_i XOR T)'

   * An initial counter is then initialized from the nonce to create
     `IC = flags | nonce | padding', where `padding' is the shortest
     string of zero bytes such that `IC' is exactly one block in length.

   * The authentication tag is encrypted using using CTR mode: `MAC =
     E_k(IC) XOR T'

   * The plaintext is then encrypted using CTR mode with an initial
     counter of `IC+1'.

   CCM mode decryption operates similarly, except that the ciphertext
and MAC are first decrypted using CTR mode to retreive the plaintext
and authentication tag. The authentication tag can then be recalucated
from the authenticated data and plantext, and compared to the value in
the message to check for authenticity.

6.4.3.1 General CCM interface
.............................

For all of the functions in the CCM interface, CIPHER is the context
struct for the underlying cipher and F is the encryption function. The
cipher's encryption key must be set before calling any of the CCM
functions. The cipher's decryption function and key are never used.

 -- Context struct: struct ccm_ctx
     Holds state corresponding to a particular message.

 -- Constant: CCM_BLOCK_SIZE
     CCM's block size, 16.

 -- Constant: CCM_DIGEST_SIZE
     Size of the CCM digest, 16.

 -- Constant: CCM_MIN_NONCE_SIZE
 -- Constant: CCM_MAX_NONCE_SIZE
     The the minimum and maximum sizes for an CCM nonce, 7 and 14,
     respectively.

 -- Macro: CCM_MAX_MSG_SIZE (NONCE_SIZE)
     The largest allowed plaintext length, when using CCM with a nonce
     of the given size.

 -- Function: void ccm_set_nonce (struct ccm_ctx *CTX, const void
          *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F, size_t NONCELEN, const
          uint8_t *NONCE, size_t AUTHLEN, size_t MSGLEN, size_t TAGLEN)
     Initializes CTX using the given nonce and the sizes of the
     authenticated data, message, and MAC to be processed.

 -- Function: void ccm_update (struct ccm_ctx *CTX, const void *CIPHER,
          nettle_cipher_func *F, size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Provides associated data to be authenticated. Must be called after
     `ccm_set_nonce', and before `ccm_encrypt', `ccm_decrypt', or
     `ccm_digest'.

 -- Function: void ccm_encrypt (struct ccm_ctx *CTX, const void
          *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST,
          const uint8_t *SRC)
 -- Function: void ccm_decrypt (struct ccm_ctx *CTX, const void
          *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func *F, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST,
          const uint8_t *SRC)
     Encrypts or decrypts the message data. Must be called after
     `ccm_set_nonce' and before `ccm_digest'. All but the last call for
     each message _must_ use a length that is a multiple of the block
     size.

 -- Function: void ccm_digest (struct ccm_ctx *CTX, const void *CIPHER,
          nettle_cipher_func *F, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Extracts the message digest (also known "authentication tag").
     This is the final operation when processing a message. LENGTH is
     usually equal to the TAGLEN parameter supplied to `ccm_set_nonce',
     but if you provide a smaller value, only the first LENGTH octets
     of the digest are written.

   To encrypt a message using the general CCM interface, set the
message nonce and length using `ccm_set_nonce' and then call
`ccm_update' to generate the digest of any authenticated data.  After
all of the authenticated data has been digested use `ccm_encrypt' to
encrypt the plaintext. Finally, use `ccm_digest' to return the
encrypted MAC.

   To decrypt a message, use `ccm_set_nonce' and `ccm_update' the same
as you would for encryption, and then call `ccm_decrypt' to decrypt the
ciphertext. After decrypting the ciphertext `ccm_digest' will return
the encrypted MAC which should be identical to the MAC in the received
message.

6.4.3.2 CCM message interface
.............................

The CCM message fuctions provides a simple interface that will perform
authentication and message encryption in a single function call.  The
length of the cleartext is given by MLENGTH and the length of the
ciphertext is given by CLENGTH, always exactly TLENGTH bytes longer
than the corresponding plaintext. The length argument passed to a
function is always the size for the result, CLENGTH for the encryption
functions, and MLENGTH for the decryption functions.

 -- Function: void ccm_encrypt_message (void *CIPHER,
          nettle_cipher_func *F, size_t NLENGTH, const uint8_t *NONCE,
          size_t ALENGTH, const uint8_t *ADATA, size_t TLENGTH, size_t
          CLENGTH, uint8_t *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Computes the message digest from the ADATA and SRC parameters,
     encrypts the plaintext from SRC, appends the encrypted MAC to
     ciphertext and outputs it to DST.

 -- Function: int ccm_decrypt_message (void *CIPHER, nettle_cipher_func
          *F, size_t NLENGTH, const uint8_t *NONCE, size_t ALENGTH,
          const uint8_t *ADATA, size_t TLENGTH, size_t MLENGTH, uint8_t
          *DST, const uint8_t *SRC)
     Decrypts the ciphertext from SRC, outputs the plaintext to DST,
     recalculates the MAC from ADATA and the plaintext, and compares it
     to the final TLENGTH bytes of SRC. If the values of the received
     and calculated MACs are equal, this will return 1 indicating a
     valid and authenticated message. Otherwise, this function will
     return zero.

6.4.3.3 CCM-AES interface
.........................

The AES CCM functions provide an API for using CCM mode with the AES
block ciphers. The parameters all have the same meaning as the general
and message interfaces, except that the CIPHER, F, and CTX parameters
are replaced with an AES context structure, and a set-key function must
be called before using any of the other functions in this interface.

 -- Context struct: struct ccm_aes128_ctx
     Holds state corresponding to a particular message encrypted using
     the AES-128 block cipher.

     Holds state corresponding to a particular message encrypted using
     the AES-192 block cipher.

     Holds state corresponding to a particular message encrypted using
     the AES-256 block cipher.

          const uint8_t *KEY)

     these functions must be called before any of the other functions
     in the AES CCM interface.

          size_t NONCELEN, const uint8_t *NONCE, size_t AUTHLEN, size_t

     These are identical to `ccm_set_nonce', except that CIPHER, F, and
     CTX are replaced with a context structure.

     and CTX are replaced with a context structure.

6.4.4 ChaCha-Poly1305
---------------------

ChaCha-Poly1305 is a combination of the ChaCha stream cipher and the
poly1305 message authentication code (*note Poly1305::). It originates
from the NaCl cryptographic library by D. J. Bernstein et al, which
defines a similar construction but with Salsa20 instead of ChaCha.

   Nettle's implementation ChaCha-Poly1305 should be considered
*experimental*. At the time of this writing, there is no authoritative
specification for ChaCha-Poly1305, and a couple of different
incompatible variants. Nettle implements it using the original
definition of ChaCha, with 64 bits (8 octets) each for the nonce and the
block counter. Some protocols prefer to use nonces of 12 bytes, and it's
a small change to ChaCha to use the upper 32 bits of the block counter
as a nonce, instead limiting message size to 2^32 blocks or 256 GBytes,
but that variant is currently not supported.

   For ChaCha-Poly1305, the ChaCha cipher is initialized with a key, of
256 bits, and a per-message nonce. The first block of the key stream
(counter all zero) is set aside for the authentication subkeys. Of this
64-octet block, the first 16 octets specify the poly1305 evaluation
point, and the next 16 bytes specify the value to add in for the final
digest. The final 32 bytes of this block are unused. Note that unlike
poly1305-aes, the evaluation point depends on the nonce. This is
preferable, because it leaks less information in case the attacker for
some reason is lucky enough to forge a valid authentication tag, and
observe (from the receiver's behaviour) that the forgery succeeded.

   The ChaCha key stream, starting with counter value 1, is then used to
encrypt the message. For authentication, poly1305 is applied to the
concatenation of the associated data, the cryptotext, and the lengths of
the associated data and the message, each a 64-bit number (eight octets,
little-endian). Nettle defines ChaCha-Poly1305 in
`<nettle/chacha-poly1305.h>'.

 -- Constant: CHACHA_POLY1305_BLOCK_SIZE
     Same as the ChaCha block size, 64.

     This is the final operation when processing a message. If LENGTH is
     smaller than `CHACHA_POLY1305_DIGEST_SIZE', only the first LENGTH
     octets of the digest are written.

     These are most of the AEAD constructions that Nettle implements.
     Note that CCM is missing; it requirement that the message size is
     specified in advance makes it incompatible with the `nettle_aead'
     abstraction.

   Nettle also exports a list of all these constructions.

6.5 Keyed Hash Functions
========================

A "keyed hash function", or "Message Authentication Code" (MAC) is a
function that takes a key and a message, and produces fixed size MAC.
It should be hard to compute a message and a matching MAC without
knowledge of the key. It should also be hard to compute the key given
only messages and corresponding MACs.

   Keyed hash functions are useful primarily for message authentication,
when Alice and Bob shares a secret: The sender, Alice, computes the MAC
and attaches it to the message. The receiver, Bob, also computes the
MAC of the message, using the same key, and compares that to Alice's
value. If they match, Bob can be assured that the message has not been
modified on its way from Alice.

   However, unlike digital signatures, this assurance is not
transferable.  Bob can't show the message and the MAC to a third party
and prove that Alice sent that message. Not even if he gives away the
key to the third party. The reason is that the _same_ key is used on
both sides, and anyone knowing the key can create a correct MAC for any
message. If Bob believes that only he and Alice knows the key, and he
knows that he didn't attach a MAC to a particular message, he knows it
must be Alice who did it. However, the third party can't distinguish
between a MAC created by Alice and one created by Bob.

   Keyed hash functions are typically a lot faster than digital
signatures as well.

6.5.1 HMAC
----------

One can build keyed hash functions from ordinary hash functions. Older
constructions simply concatenate secret key and message and hashes
that, but such constructions have weaknesses. A better construction is
HMAC, described in `RFC 2104'.

   For an underlying hash function `H', with digest size `l' and
internal block size `b', HMAC-H is constructed as follows: From a given
key `k', two distinct subkeys `k_i' and `k_o' are constructed, both of
length `b'. The HMAC-H of a message `m' is then computed as `H(k_o |
H(k_i | m))', where `|' denotes string concatenation.

   HMAC keys can be of any length, but it is recommended to use keys of
length `l', the digest size of the underlying hash function `H'. Keys
that are longer than `b' are shortened to length `l' by hashing with
`H', so arbitrarily long keys aren't very useful.

   Nettle's HMAC functions are defined in `<nettle/hmac.h>'.  There are
abstract functions that use a pointer to a `struct nettle_hash' to
represent the underlying hash function and `void *' pointers that point
to three different context structs for that hash function. There are
also concrete functions for HMAC-MD5, HMAC-RIPEMD160 HMAC-SHA1,
HMAC-SHA256, and HMAC-SHA512. First, the abstract functions:

 -- Function: void hmac_set_key (void *OUTER, void *INNER, void *STATE,
          const struct nettle_hash *H, size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t
          *KEY)
     Initializes the three context structs from the key. The OUTER and
     INNER contexts corresponds to the subkeys `k_o' and `k_i'. STATE
     is used for hashing the message, and is initialized as a copy of
     the INNER context.

 -- Function: void hmac_update (void *STATE, const struct nettle_hash
          *H, size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     This function is called zero or more times to process the message.
     Actually, `hmac_update(state, H, length, data)' is equivalent to
     `H->update(state, length, data)', so if you wish you can use the
     ordinary update function of the underlying hash function instead.

 -- Function: void hmac_digest (const void *OUTER, const void *INNER,
          void *STATE, const struct nettle_hash *H, size_t LENGTH,
          uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Extracts the MAC of the message, writing it to DIGEST.  OUTER and
     INNER are not modified. LENGTH is usually equal to
     `H->digest_size', but if you provide a smaller value, only the
     first LENGTH octets of the MAC are written.

     This function also resets the STATE context so that you can start
     over processing a new message (with the same key).

   Like for CBC, there are some macros to help use these functions
correctly.

 -- Macro: HMAC_CTX (TYPE)
     Expands to
          {
             type outer;
             type inner;
             type state;
          }

   It can be used to define a HMAC context struct, either directly,

     struct HMAC_CTX(struct md5_ctx) ctx;

   or to give it a struct tag,

     struct hmac_md5_ctx HMAC_CTX (struct md5_ctx);

 -- Macro: HMAC_SET_KEY (CTX, H, LENGTH, KEY)
     CTX is a pointer to a context struct as defined by `HMAC_CTX', H
     is a pointer to a `const struct nettle_hash' describing the
     underlying hash function (so it must match the type of the
     components of CTX). The last two arguments specify the secret key.

 -- Macro: HMAC_DIGEST (CTX, H, LENGTH, DIGEST)
     CTX is a pointer to a context struct as defined by `HMAC_CTX', H
     is a pointer to a `const struct nettle_hash' describing the
     underlying hash function. The last two arguments specify where the
     digest is written.

   Note that there is no `HMAC_UPDATE' macro; simply call `hmac_update'
function directly, or the update function of the underlying hash
function.

6.5.2 Concrete HMAC functions

than the general HMAC functions.

     the MAC are written.

     This function also resets the context for processing new messages,
     with the same key.

6.5.2.4 HMAC-SHA256
...................

6.5.3 UMAC
----------

UMAC is a message authentication code based on universal hashing, and
designed for high performance on modern processors (in contrast to GCM,
*Note GCM::, which is designed primarily for hardware performance). On
processors with good integer multiplication performance, it can be 10
times faster than SHA256 and SHA512.  UMAC is specified in `RFC 4418'.

   The secret key is always 128 bits (16 octets). The key is used as an
encryption key for the AES block cipher. This cipher is used in counter
mode to generate various internal subkeys needed in UMAC. Messages are
of arbitrary size, and for each message, UMAC also needs a unique
nonce. Nonce values must not be reused for two messages with the same
key, but they need not be kept secret.

   The nonce must be at least one octet, and at most 16; nonces shorter
than 16 octets are zero-padded. Nettle's implementation of UMAC
increments the nonce automatically for each message, so explicitly
setting the nonce for each message is optional. This auto-increment
uses network byte order and it takes the length of the nonce into
account. E.g., if the initial nonce is "abc" (3 octets), this value is
zero-padded to 16 octets for the first message. For the next message,
the nonce is incremented to "abd", and this incremented value is
zero-padded to 16 octets.

   UMAC is defined in four variants, for different output sizes: 32
bits (4 octets), 64 bits (8 octets), 96 bits (12 octets) and 128 bits
(16 octets), corresponding to different trade-offs between speed and
security. Using a shorter output size sometimes (but not always!) gives
the same result as using a longer output size and truncating the result.
So it is important to use the right variant. For consistency with other
hash and MAC functions, Nettle's `_digest' functions for UMAC accept a
length parameter so that the output can be truncated to any desired
size, but it is recommended to stick to the specified output size and
select the umac variant corresponding to the desired size.

   The internal block size of UMAC is 1024 octets, and it also
generates more than 1024 bytes of subkeys. This makes the size of the
context struct quite a bit larger than other hash functions and MAC
algorithms in Nettle.

   Nettle defines UMAC in `<nettle/umac.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct umac32_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct umac64_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct umac96_ctx
 -- Context struct: struct umac128_ctx
     Each UMAC variant uses its own context struct.

 -- Constant: UMAC_KEY_SIZE
     The UMAC key size, 16.

 -- Constant: UMAC_MIN_NONCE_SIZE
 -- Constant: UMAC_MAX_NONCE_SIZE
     The the minimum and maximum sizes for an UMAC nonce, 1 and 16,
     respectively.

 -- Constant: UMAC32_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of an UMAC32 digest, 4.

 -- Constant: UMAC64_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of an UMAC64 digest, 8.

 -- Constant: UMAC96_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of an UMAC96 digest, 12.

 -- Constant: UMAC128_DIGEST_SIZE
     The size of an UMAC128 digest, 16.

 -- Constant: UMAC_BLOCK_SIZE
     The internal block size of UMAC.

 -- Function: void umac32_set_key (struct umac32_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void umac64_set_key (struct umac64_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void umac96_set_key (struct umac96_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *KEY)
 -- Function: void umac128_set_key (struct umac128_ctx *CTX, const
          uint8_t *KEY)
     These functions initialize the UMAC context struct. They also
     initialize the nonce to zero (with length 16, for auto-increment).

 -- Function: void umac32_set_nonce (struct umac32_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *NONCE)
 -- Function: void umac64_set_nonce (struct umac64_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *NONCE)
 -- Function: void umac96_set_nonce (struct umac96_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *NONCE)
 -- Function: void umac128_set_nonce (struct umac128_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *NONCE)
     Sets the nonce to be used for the next message. In general, nonces
     should be set before processing of the message. This is not
     strictly required for UMAC (the nonce only affects the final
     processing generating the digest), but it is nevertheless
     recommended that this function is called _before_ the first
     `_update' call for the message.

 -- Function: void umac32_update (struct umac32_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
 -- Function: void umac64_update (struct umac64_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
 -- Function: void umac96_update (struct umac96_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
 -- Function: void umac128_update (struct umac128_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     These functions are called zero or more times to process the
     message.

 -- Function: void umac32_digest (struct umac32_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
 -- Function: void umac64_digest (struct umac64_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
 -- Function: void umac96_digest (struct umac96_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
 -- Function: void umac128_digest (struct umac128_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Extracts the MAC of the message, writing it to DIGEST.  LENGTH is
     usually equal to the specified output size, but if you provide a
     smaller value, only the first LENGTH octets of the MAC are
     written. These functions reset the context for processing of a new
     message with the same key. The nonce is incremented as described
     above, the new value is used unless you call the `_set_nonce'
     function explicitly for each message.

6.5.4 Poly1305
--------------

Poly1305-AES is a message authentication code designed by D. J.
Bernstein. It treats the message as a polynomial modulo the prime number
2^130 - 5.

   The key, 256 bits, consists of two parts, where the first half is an
AES-128 key, and the second half specifies the point where the
polynomial is evaluated. Of the latter half, 22 bits are set to zero, to
enable high-performance implementation, leaving 106 bits for specifying
an evaluation point `r'. For each message, one must also provide a
128-bit nonce. The nonce is encrypted using the AES key, and that's the
only thing AES is used for.

   The message is split into 128-bit chunks (with final chunk possibly
being shorter), each read as a little-endian integer. Each chunk has a
one-bit appended at the high end. The resulting integers are treated as
polynomial coefficients modulo 2^130 - 5, and the polynomial is
evaluated at the point `r'. Finally, this value is reduced modulo
2^128, and added (also modulo 2^128) to the encrypted nonce, to produce
an 128-bit authenticator for the message. See
`http://cr.yp.to/mac/poly1305-20050329.pdf' for further details.

   Clearly, variants using a different cipher than AES could be
defined. Another variant is the ChaCha-Poly1305 AEAD construction
(*note ChaCha-Poly1305::). Nettle defines Poly1305-AES in
`nettle/poly1305.h'.

 -- Constant: POLY1305_AES_KEY_SIZE
     Key size, 32 octets.

 -- Constant: POLY1305_AES_DIGEST_SIZE
     Size of the digest or "authenticator", 16 octets.

 -- Constant: POLY1305_AES_NONCE_SIZE
     Nonce size, 16 octets.

 -- Context struct: struct poly1305_aes_ctx
     The poly1305-aes context struct.

 -- Function: void poly1305_aes_set_key (struct poly1305_aes_ctx *CTX,
          const uint8_t *KEY)
     Initialize the context struct. Also sets the nonce to zero.

 -- Function: void poly1305_aes_set_nonce (struct poly1305_aes_ctx
          *CTX, const uint8_t *NONCE)
     Sets the nonce. Calling this function is optional, since the nonce
     is incremented automatically for each message.

 -- Function: void poly1305_aes_update (struct poly1305_aes_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Process more data.

 -- Function: void poly1305_aes_digest (struct poly1305_aes_ctx *CTX,
          size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DIGEST)
     Extracts the digest. If LENGTH is smaller than
     `POLY1305_AES_DIGEST_SIZE', only the first LENGTH octets are
     written. Also increments the nonce, and prepares the context for
     processing a new message.

6.6 Key derivation Functions
============================

A "key derivation function" (KDF) is a function that from a given
symmetric key derives other symmetric keys.  A sub-class of KDFs is the
"password-based key derivation functions" (PBKDFs), which take as input
a password or passphrase, and its purpose is typically to strengthen it
and protect against certain pre-computation attacks by using salting
and expensive computation.

6.6.1 PBKDF2
------------

The most well known PBKDF is the `PKCS #5 PBKDF2' described in `RFC
2898' which uses a pseudo-random function such as HMAC-SHA1.

   Nettle's PBKDF2 functions are defined in `<nettle/pbkdf2.h>'.  There
is an abstract function that operate on any PRF implemented via the
`nettle_hash_update_func', `nettle_hash_digest_func' interfaces.  There
is also helper macros and concrete functions PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 and
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256.  First, the abstract function:

 -- Function: void pbkdf2 (void *mac_ctx, nettle_hash_update_func
          *update, nettle_hash_digest_func *digest, size_t digest_size,
          unsigned iterations, size_t salt_length, const uint8_t *salt,
          size_t length, uint8_t *dst)
     Derive symmetric key from a password according to PKCS #5 PBKDF2.
     The PRF is assumed to have been initialized and this function will
     call the UPDATE and DIGEST functions passing the MAC_CTX context
     parameter as an argument in order to compute digest of size
     DIGEST_SIZE.  Inputs are the salt SALT of length SALT_LENGTH, the
     iteration counter ITERATIONS (> 0), and the desired derived output
     length LENGTH.  The output buffer is DST which must have room for
     at least LENGTH octets.

   Like for CBC and HMAC, there is a macro to help use the function
correctly.

 -- Macro: PBKDF2 (CTX, UPDATE, DIGEST, DIGEST_SIZE, ITERATIONS,
          SALT_LENGTH, SALT, LENGTH, DST)
     CTX is a pointer to a context struct passed to the UPDATE and
     DIGEST functions (of the types `nettle_hash_update_func' and
     `nettle_hash_digest_func' respectively) to implement the
     underlying PRF with digest size of DIGEST_SIZE.  Inputs are the
     salt SALT of length SALT_LENGTH, the iteration counter ITERATIONS
     (> 0), and the desired derived output length LENGTH.  The output
     buffer is DST which must have room for at least LENGTH octets.

6.6.2 Concrete PBKDF2 functions
-------------------------------

Now we come to the specialized PBKDF2 functions, which are easier to
use than the general PBKDF2 function.

6.6.2.1 PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1
........................

 -- Function: void pbkdf2_hmac_sha1 (size_t KEY_LENGTH, const uint8_t
          *KEY, unsigned ITERATIONS, size_t SALT_LENGTH, const uint8_t
          *SALT, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST)
     PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1.  Derive LENGTH bytes of key into buffer DST
     using the password KEY of length KEY_LENGTH and salt SALT of
     length SALT_LENGTH, with iteration counter ITERATIONS (> 0).  The
     output buffer is DST which must have room for at least LENGTH
     octets.

6.6.2.2 PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
..........................

 -- Function: void pbkdf2_hmac_sha256 (size_t KEY_LENGTH, const uint8_t
          *KEY, unsigned ITERATIONS, size_t SALT_LENGTH, const uint8_t
          *SALT, size_t LENGTH, uint8_t *DST)
     PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256.  Derive LENGTH bytes of key into buffer
     DST using the password KEY of length KEY_LENGTH and salt SALT of
     length SALT_LENGTH, with iteration counter ITERATIONS (> 0).  The
     output buffer is DST which must have room for at least LENGTH
     octets.

6.7 Public-key algorithms
=========================

Nettle uses GMP, the GNU bignum library, for all calculations with
large numbers. In order to use the public-key features of Nettle, you
must install GMP, at least version 3.0, before compiling Nettle, and
you need to link your programs with `-lhogweed -lnettle -lgmp'.

   The concept of "Public-key" encryption and digital signatures was
discovered by Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman and described in a
paper 1976. In traditional, "symmetric", cryptography, sender and
receiver share the same keys, and these keys must be distributed in a
secure way. And if there are many users or entities that need to
communicate, each _pair_ needs a shared secret key known by nobody else.

   Public-key cryptography uses trapdoor one-way functions. A "one-way
function" is a function `F' such that it is easy to compute the value
`F(x)' for any `x', but given a value `y', it is hard to compute a
corresponding `x' such that `y = F(x)'. Two examples are cryptographic
hash functions, and exponentiation in certain groups.

   A "trapdoor one-way function" is a function `F' that is one-way,
unless one knows some secret information about `F'. If one knows the
secret, it is easy to compute both `F' and it's inverse.  If this
sounds strange, look at the RSA example below.

   Two important uses for one-way functions with trapdoors are
public-key encryption, and digital signatures. The public-key
encryption functions in Nettle are not yet documented; the rest of this
chapter is about digital signatures.

   To use a digital signature algorithm, one must first create a
"key-pair": A public key and a corresponding private key. The private
key is used to sign messages, while the public key is used for verifying
that that signatures and messages match. Some care must be taken when
distributing the public key; it need not be kept secret, but if a bad
guy is able to replace it (in transit, or in some user's list of known
public keys), bad things may happen.

   There are two operations one can do with the keys. The signature
operation takes a message and a private key, and creates a signature for
the message. A signature is some string of bits, usually at most a few
thousand bits or a few hundred octets. Unlike paper-and-ink signatures,
the digital signature depends on the message, so one can't cut it out of
context and glue it to a different message.

   The verification operation takes a public key, a message, and a
string that is claimed to be a signature on the message, and returns
true or false. If it returns true, that means that the three input
values matched, and the verifier can be sure that someone went through
with the signature operation on that very message, and that the
"someone" also knows the private key corresponding to the public key.

   The desired properties of a digital signature algorithm are as
follows: Given the public key and pairs of messages and valid
signatures on them, it should be hard to compute the private key, and
it should also be hard to create a new message and signature that is
accepted by the verification operation.

   Besides signing meaningful messages, digital signatures can be used
for authorization. A server can be configured with a public key, such
that any client that connects to the service is given a random nonce
message.  If the server gets a reply with a correct signature matching
the nonce message and the configured public key, the client is granted
access. So the configuration of the server can be understood as "grant
access to whoever knows the private key corresponding to this
particular public key, and to no others".

6.7.1 RSA
---------

The RSA algorithm was the first practical digital signature algorithm
that was constructed. It was described 1978 in a paper by Ronald
Rivest, Adi Shamir and L.M. Adleman, and the technique was also
patented in the USA in 1983. The patent expired on September 20, 2000,
and since that day, RSA can be used freely, even in the USA.

   It's remarkably simple to describe the trapdoor function behind RSA.
The "one-way"-function used is

     F(x) = x^e mod n

   I.e. raise x to the `e''th power, while discarding all multiples of
`n'. The pair of numbers `n' and `e' is the public key.  `e' can be
quite small, even `e = 3' has been used, although slightly larger
numbers are recommended. `n' should be about 1000 bits or larger.

   If `n' is large enough, and properly chosen, the inverse of F, the
computation of `e''th roots modulo `n', is very difficult.  But,
where's the trapdoor?

   Let's first look at how RSA key-pairs are generated. First `n' is
chosen as the product of two large prime numbers `p' and `q' of roughly
the same size (so if `n' is 1000 bits, `p' and `q' are about 500 bits
each). One also computes the number `phi = (p-1)(q-1)', in mathematical
speak, `phi' is the order of the multiplicative group of integers
modulo n.

   Next, `e' is chosen. It must have no factors in common with `phi' (in
particular, it must be odd), but can otherwise be chosen more or less
randomly. `e = 65537' is a popular choice, because it makes raising to
the `e''th power particularly efficient, and being prime, it usually
has no factors common with `phi'.

   Finally, a number `d', `d < n' is computed such that `e d mod phi =
1'. It can be shown that such a number exists (this is why `e' and
`phi' must have no common factors), and that for all x,

     (x^e)^d mod n = x^(ed) mod n = (x^d)^e mod n = x

   Using Euclid's algorithm, `d' can be computed quite easily from
`phi' and `e'. But it is still hard to get `d' without knowing `phi',
which depends on the factorization of `n'.

   So `d' is the trapdoor, if we know `d' and `y = F(x)', we can
recover x as `y^d mod n'. `d' is also the private half of the RSA
key-pair.

   The most common signature operation for RSA is defined in `PKCS#1',
a specification by RSA Laboratories. The message to be signed is first
hashed using a cryptographic hash function, e.g.  MD5 or SHA1. Next,
some padding, the ASN.1 "Algorithm Identifier" for the hash function,
and the message digest itself, are concatenated and converted to a
number `x'. The signature is computed from `x' and the private key as
`s = x^d mod n'(1) (*note RSA-Footnote-1::). The signature, `s' is a
number of about the same size of `n', and it usually encoded as a
sequence of octets, most significant octet first.

   The verification operation is straight-forward, `x' is computed from
the message in the same way as above. Then `s^e mod n' is computed, the
operation returns true if and only if the result equals `x'.

6.7.1.1 Nettle's RSA support
............................

Nettle represents RSA keys using two structures that contain large
numbers (of type `mpz_t').

 -- Context struct: rsa_public_key size n e
     `size' is the size, in octets, of the modulo, and is used
     internally.  `n' and `e' is the public key.

 -- Context struct: rsa_private_key size d p q a b c
     `size' is the size, in octets, of the modulo, and is used
     internally.  `d' is the secret exponent, but it is not actually
     used when signing. Instead, the factors `p' and `q', and the
     parameters `a', `b' and `c' are used. They are computed from `p',
     `q' and `e' such that `a e mod (p - 1) = 1, b e mod (q - 1) = 1, c
     q mod p = 1'.

   Before use, these structs must be initialized by calling one of

 -- Function: void rsa_public_key_init (struct rsa_public_key *PUB)
 -- Function: void rsa_private_key_init (struct rsa_private_key *KEY)
     Calls `mpz_init' on all numbers in the key struct.

   and when finished with them, the space for the numbers must be
deallocated by calling one of

 -- Function: void rsa_public_key_clear (struct rsa_public_key *PUB)
 -- Function: void rsa_private_key_clear (struct rsa_private_key *KEY)
     Calls `mpz_clear' on all numbers in the key struct.

   In general, Nettle's RSA functions deviates from Nettle's "no memory
allocation"-policy. Space for all the numbers, both in the key structs
above, and temporaries, are allocated dynamically. For information on
how to customize allocation, see *Note GMP Allocation: (gmp)Custom
Allocation.

   When you have assigned values to the attributes of a key, you must
call

 -- Function: int rsa_public_key_prepare (struct rsa_public_key *PUB)
 -- Function: int rsa_private_key_prepare (struct rsa_private_key *KEY)
     Computes the octet size of the key (stored in the `size' attribute,
     and may also do other basic sanity checks. Returns one if
     successful, or zero if the key can't be used, for instance if the
     modulo is smaller than the minimum size needed for RSA operations
     specified by PKCS#1.

   Before signing or verifying a message, you first hash it with the
appropriate hash function. You pass the hash function's context struct
to the RSA signature function, and it will extract the message digest
and do the rest of the work. There are also alternative functions that
take the hash digest as argument.

   There is currently no support for using SHA224 or SHA384 with RSA
signatures, since there's no gain in either computation time nor
message size compared to using SHA256 and SHA512, respectively.

   Creation and verification of signatures is done with the following
functions:

 -- Function: int rsa_md5_sign (const struct rsa_private_key *KEY,
          struct md5_ctx *HASH, mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha1_sign (const struct rsa_private_key *KEY,
          struct sha1_ctx *HASH, mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha256_sign (const struct rsa_private_key *KEY,
          struct sha256_ctx *HASH, mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha512_sign (const struct rsa_private_key *KEY,
          struct sha512_ctx *HASH, mpz_t SIGNATURE)
     The signature is stored in SIGNATURE (which must have been
     `mpz_init''ed earlier). The hash context is reset so that it can be
     used for new messages. Returns one on success, or zero on failure.
     Signing fails if the key is too small for the given hash size,
     e.g., it's not possible to create a signature using SHA512 and a
     512-bit RSA key.

 -- Function: int rsa_md5_sign_digest (const struct rsa_private_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha1_sign_digest (const struct rsa_private_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, mpz_t SIGNATURE);
 -- Function: int rsa_sha256_sign_digest (const struct rsa_private_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, mpz_t SIGNATURE);
 -- Function: int rsa_sha512_sign_digest (const struct rsa_private_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, mpz_t SIGNATURE);
     Creates a signature from the given hash digest. DIGEST should
     point to a digest of size `MD5_DIGEST_SIZE', `SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE',
     or `SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE', respectively. The signature is stored in
     SIGNATURE (which must have been `mpz_init':ed earlier). Returns
     one on success, or zero on failure.

 -- Function: int rsa_md5_verify (const struct rsa_public_key *KEY,
          struct md5_ctx *HASH, const mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha1_verify (const struct rsa_public_key *KEY,
          struct sha1_ctx *HASH, const mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha256_verify (const struct rsa_public_key *KEY,
          struct sha256_ctx *HASH, const mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha512_verify (const struct rsa_public_key *KEY,
          struct sha512_ctx *HASH, const mpz_t SIGNATURE)
     Returns 1 if the signature is valid, or 0 if it isn't. In either
     case, the hash context is reset so that it can be used for new
     messages.

 -- Function: int rsa_md5_verify_digest (const struct rsa_public_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, const mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha1_verify_digest (const struct rsa_public_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, const mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha256_verify_digest (const struct rsa_public_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, const mpz_t SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int rsa_sha512_verify_digest (const struct rsa_public_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, const mpz_t SIGNATURE)
     Returns 1 if the signature is valid, or 0 if it isn't. DIGEST
     should point to a digest of size `MD5_DIGEST_SIZE',
     `SHA1_DIGEST_SIZE', or `SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE', respectively.

   If you need to use the RSA trapdoor, the private key, in a way that
isn't supported by the above functions Nettle also includes a function
that computes `x^d mod n' and nothing more, using the CRT optimization.

 -- Function: void rsa_compute_root (struct rsa_private_key *KEY, mpz_t
          X, const mpz_t M)
     Computes `x = m^d', efficiently.

   At last, how do you create new keys?

 -- Function: int rsa_generate_keypair (struct rsa_public_key *PUB,
          struct rsa_private_key *KEY, void *RANDOM_CTX,
          nettle_random_func RANDOM, void *PROGRESS_CTX,
          nettle_progress_func PROGRESS, unsigned N_SIZE, unsigned
          E_SIZE);
     There are lots of parameters. PUB and KEY is where the resulting
     key pair is stored. The structs should be initialized, but you
     don't need to call `rsa_public_key_prepare' or
     `rsa_private_key_prepare' after key generation.

     RANDOM_CTX and RANDOM is a randomness generator.
     `random(random_ctx, length, dst)' should generate `length' random
     octets and store them at `dst'. For advice, see *Note Randomness::.

     PROGRESS and PROGRESS_CTX can be used to get callbacks during the
     key generation process, in order to uphold an illusion of
     progress. PROGRESS can be NULL, in that case there are no
     callbacks.

     SIZE_N is the desired size of the modulo, in bits. If SIZE_E is
     non-zero, it is the desired size of the public exponent and a
     random exponent of that size is selected. But if E_SIZE is zero,
     it is assumed that the caller has already chosen a value for `e',
     and stored it in PUB.  Returns one on success, and zero on
     failure. The function can fail for example if if N_SIZE is too
     small, or if E_SIZE is zero and `pub->e' is an even number.

   (1) Actually, the computation is not done like this, it is done more
efficiently using `p', `q' and the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). But
the result is the same.

6.7.2 DSA
---------

The DSA digital signature algorithm is more complex than RSA. It was
specified during the early 1990s, and in 1994 NIST published FIPS 186
which is the authoritative specification.  Sometimes DSA is referred to
using the acronym DSS, for Digital Signature Standard. The most recent
revision of the specification, FIPS186-3, was issued in 2009, and it
adds support for larger hash functions than sha1.

   For DSA, the underlying mathematical problem is the computation of
discrete logarithms. The public key consists of a large prime `p', a
small prime `q' which is a factor of `p-1', a number `g' which
generates a subgroup of order `q' modulo `p', and an element `y' in
that subgroup.

   In the original DSA, the size of `q' is fixed to 160 bits, to match
with the SHA1 hash algorithm. The size of `p' is in principle
unlimited, but the standard specifies only nine specific sizes: `512 +
l*64', where `l' is between 0 and 8. Thus, the maximum size of `p' is
1024 bits, and sizes less than 1024 bits are considered obsolete and not
secure.

   The subgroup requirement means that if you compute

     g^t mod p

   for all possible integers `t', you will get precisely `q' distinct
values.

   The private key is a secret exponent `x', such that

     g^x = y mod p

   In mathematical speak, `x' is the "discrete logarithm" of `y' mod
`p', with respect to the generator `g'. The size of `x' will also be
about the same size as `q'. The security of the DSA algorithm relies on
the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. Current algorithms to
compute discrete logarithms in this setting, and hence crack DSA, are
of two types. The first type works directly in the (multiplicative)
group of integers mod `p'. The best known algorithm of this type is the
Number Field Sieve, and it's complexity is similar to the complexity of
factoring numbers of the same size as `p'. The other type works in the
smaller `q'-sized subgroup generated by `g', which has a more difficult
group structure. One good algorithm is Pollard-rho, which has
complexity `sqrt(q)'.

   The important point is that security depends on the size of _both_
`p' and `q', and they should be chosen so that the difficulty of both
discrete logarithm methods are comparable. Today, the security margin
of the original DSA may be uncomfortably small. Using a `p' of 1024
bits implies that cracking using the number field sieve is expected to
take about the same time as factoring a 1024-bit RSA modulo, and using
a `q' of size 160 bits implies that cracking using Pollard-rho will
take roughly `2^80' group operations. With the size of `q' fixed, tied
to the SHA1 digest size, it may be tempting to increase the size of `p'
to, say, 4096 bits. This will provide excellent resistance against
attacks like the number field sieve which works in the large group. But
it will do very little to defend against Pollard-rho attacking the small
subgroup; the attacker is slowed down at most by a single factor of 10
due to the more expensive group operation. And the attacker will surely
choose the latter attack.

   The signature generation algorithm is randomized; in order to create
a DSA signature, you need a good source for random numbers (*note
Randomness::). Let us describe the common case of a 160-bit `q'.

   To create a signature, one starts with the hash digest of the
message, `h', which is a 160 bit number, and a random number `k,
0<k<q', also 160 bits. Next, one computes

     r = (g^k mod p) mod q
     s = k^-1 (h + x r) mod q

   The signature is the pair `(r, s)', two 160 bit numbers. Note the
two different mod operations when computing `r', and the use of the
secret exponent `x'.

   To verify a signature, one first checks that `0 < r,s < q', and then
one computes backwards,

     w = s^-1 mod q
     v = (g^(w h) y^(w r) mod p) mod q

   The signature is valid if `v = r'. This works out because `w = s^-1
mod q = k (h + x r)^-1 mod q', so that

     g^(w h) y^(w r) = g^(w h) (g^x)^(w r) = g^(w (h + x r)) = g^k

   When reducing mod `q' this yields `r'. Note that when verifying a
signature, we don't know either `k' or `x': those numbers are secret.

   If you can choose between RSA and DSA, which one is best? Both are
believed to be secure. DSA gained popularity in the late 1990s, as a
patent free alternative to RSA. Now that the RSA patents have expired,
there's no compelling reason to want to use DSA. Today, the original
DSA key size does not provide a large security margin, and it should
probably be phased out together with RSA keys of 1024 bits. Using the
revised DSA algorithm with a larger hash function, in particular,
SHA256, a 256-bit `q', and `p' of size 2048 bits or more, should
provide for a more comfortable security margin, but these variants are
not yet in wide use.

   DSA signatures are smaller than RSA signatures, which is important
for some specialized applications.

   From a practical point of view, DSA's need for a good randomness
source is a serious disadvantage. If you ever use the same `k' (and
`r') for two different message, you leak your private key.

6.7.2.1 Nettle's DSA support
............................

Like for RSA, Nettle represents DSA keys using two structures,
containing values of type `mpz_t'. For information on how to customize
allocation, see *Note GMP Allocation: (gmp)Custom Allocation. Nettle's
DSA interface is defined in `<nettle/dsa.h>'.

   A DSA group is represented using the following struct.

 -- Context struct: dsa_params p q g
     Parameters of the DSA group.

 -- Function: void dsa_params_init (struct dsa_params *PARAMS)
     Calls `mpz_init' on all numbers in the struct.

 -- Function: void dsa_params_clear (struct dsa_params *PARAMSparams)
     Calls `mpz_clear' on all numbers in the struct.

 -- Function: int dsa_generate_params (struct dsa_params *PARAMS, void
          *RANDOM_CTX, nettle_random_func *RANDOM, void *PROGRESS_CTX,
          nettle_progress_func *PROGRESS, unsigned P_BITS, unsigned
          Q_BITS)
     Generates paramaters of a new group. The PARAMS struct should be
     initialized before you call this function.

     RANDOM_CTX and RANDOM is a randomness generator.
     `random(random_ctx, length, dst)' should generate `length' random
     octets and store them at `dst'. For advice, see *Note Randomness::.

     PROGRESS and PROGRESS_CTX can be used to get callbacks during the
     key generation process, in order to uphold an illusion of
     progress. PROGRESS can be NULL, in that case there are no
     callbacks.

     P_BITS and Q_BITS are the desired sizes of `p' and `q'. To
     generate keys that conform to the original DSA standard, you must
     use `q_bits = 160' and select P_BITS of the form `p_bits = 512 +
     l*64', for `0 <= l <= 8', where the smaller sizes are no longer
     recommended, so you should most likely stick to `p_bits = 1024'.
     Non-standard sizes are possible, in particular `p_bits' larger
     than 1024, although DSA implementations can not in general be
     expected to support such keys. Also note that using very large
     P_BITS, with Q_BITS fixed at 160, doesn't make much sense, because
     the security is also limited by the size of the smaller prime. To
     generate DSA keys for use with SHA256, use `q_bits = 256' and,
     e.g., `p_bits = 2048'.

     Returns one on success, and zero on failure. The function will
     fail if Q_BITS is too small, or too close to P_BITS.

   Signatures are represented using the structure below.

 -- Context struct: dsa_signature r s

 -- Function: void dsa_signature_init (struct dsa_signature *SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: void dsa_signature_clear (struct dsa_signature *SIGNATURE)
     You must call `dsa_signature_init' before creating or using a
     signature, and call `dsa_signature_clear' when you are finished
     with it.

   Keys are represented as bignums, of type `mpz_t'. A public keys
represent a group element, and is of the same size as `p', while a
private key is an exponent, of the same size as `q'.

 -- Function: int dsa_sign (const struct dsa_params *PARAMS, const
          mpz_t X, void *RANDOM_CTX, nettle_random_func *RANDOM, size_t
          DIGEST_SIZE, const uint8_t *DIGEST, struct dsa_signature
          *SIGNATURE)
     Creates a signature from the given hash digest, using the private
     key X. RANDOM_CTX and RANDOM is a randomness generator.
     `random(random_ctx, length, dst)' should generate `length' random
     octets and store them at `dst'. For advice, see *Note
     Randomness::. Returns one on success, or zero on failure. Signing
     can fail only if the key is invalid, so that inversion modulo `q'
     fails.

 -- Function: int dsa_verify (const struct dsa_params *PARAMS, const
          mpz_t Y, size_t DIGEST_SIZE, const uint8_t *DIGEST, const
          struct dsa_signature *SIGNATURE)
     Verifies a signature, using the public key y. Returns 1 if the
     signature is valid, otherwise 0.

   To generate a keypair, first generate a DSA group using
`dsa_generate_params'. A keypair in this group is then created using

 -- Function: void dsa_generate_keypair (const struct dsa_params
          *PARAMS, mpz_t PUB, mpz_t KEY, void *RANDOM_CTX,
          nettle_random_func *RANDOM)
     Generates a new keypair, using the group PARAMS. The public key is
     stored in PUB, and the private key in KEY. Both variables must be
     initialized using `mpz_init' before this call.

     RANDOM_CTX and RANDOM is a randomness generator.
     `random(random_ctx, length, dst)' should generate `length' random
     octets and store them at `dst'. For advice, see *Note Randomness::.

6.7.2.2 Old, deprecated, DSA interface
......................................

Versions before nettle-3.0 used a different interface for DSA
signatures, where the group parameters and the public key was packed
together as `struct dsa_public_key'. Most of this interface is kept for
backwards compatibility, and declared in `nettle/dsa-compat.h'.  Below
is the old documentation. The old and new interface use distinct names
and don't confict, with one exception: The key generation function. The
`nettle/dsa-compat.h' redefines `dsa_generate_keypair' as an alias for
`dsa_compat_generate_keypair', compatible with the old interface and
documented below.

   The old DSA functions are very similar to the corresponding RSA
functions, but there are a few differences pointed out below. For a
start, there are no functions corresponding to `rsa_public_key_prepare'
and `rsa_private_key_prepare'.

 -- Context struct: dsa_public_key p q g y
     The public parameters described above.

 -- Context struct: dsa_private_key x
     The private key `x'.

   Before use, these structs must be initialized by calling one of

 -- Function: void dsa_public_key_init (struct dsa_public_key *PUB)
 -- Function: void dsa_private_key_init (struct dsa_private_key *KEY)
     Calls `mpz_init' on all numbers in the key struct.

   When finished with them, the space for the numbers must be
deallocated by calling one of

 -- Function: void dsa_public_key_clear (struct dsa_public_key *PUB)
 -- Function: void dsa_private_key_clear (struct dsa_private_key *KEY)
     Calls `mpz_clear' on all numbers in the key struct.

   Signatures are represented using `struct dsa_signature', described
earlier.

   For signing, you need to provide both the public and the private key
(unlike RSA, where the private key struct includes all information
needed for signing), and a source for random numbers.  Signatures can
use the SHA1 or the SHA256 hash function, although the implementation
of DSA with SHA256 should be considered somewhat experimental due to
lack of official test vectors and interoperability testing.

 -- Function: int dsa_sha1_sign (const struct dsa_public_key *PUB,
          const struct dsa_private_key *KEY, void *RANDOM_CTX,
          nettle_random_func RANDOM, struct sha1_ctx *HASH, struct
          dsa_signature *SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int dsa_sha1_sign_digest (const struct dsa_public_key
          *PUB, const struct dsa_private_key *KEY, void *RANDOM_CTX,
          nettle_random_func RANDOM, const uint8_t *DIGEST, struct
          dsa_signature *SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int dsa_sha256_sign (const struct dsa_public_key *PUB,
          const struct dsa_private_key *KEY, void *RANDOM_CTX,

          nettle_random_func RANDOM, const uint8_t *DIGEST, struct
          dsa_signature *SIGNATURE)
     Creates a signature from the given hash context or digest.
     RANDOM_CTX and RANDOM is a randomness generator.
     `random(random_ctx, length, dst)' should generate `length' random
     octets and store them at `dst'. For advice, see *Note
     Randomness::. Returns one on success, or zero on failure.  Signing
     fails if the key size and the hash size don't match.

   Verifying signatures is a little easier, since no randomness
generator is needed. The functions are

 -- Function: int dsa_sha1_verify (const struct dsa_public_key *KEY,
          struct sha1_ctx *HASH, const struct dsa_signature *SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int dsa_sha1_verify_digest (const struct dsa_public_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, const struct dsa_signature
          *SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int dsa_sha256_verify (const struct dsa_public_key *KEY,
          struct sha256_ctx *HASH, const struct dsa_signature
          *SIGNATURE)
 -- Function: int dsa_sha256_verify_digest (const struct dsa_public_key
          *KEY, const uint8_t *DIGEST, const struct dsa_signature
          *SIGNATURE)
     Verifies a signature. Returns 1 if the signature is valid,
     otherwise 0.

   Key generation uses mostly the same parameters as the corresponding
RSA function.

 -- Function: int dsa_compat_generate_keypair (struct dsa_public_key
          *PUB, struct dsa_private_key *KEY, void *RANDOM_CTX,
          nettle_random_func RANDOM, void *PROGRESS_CTX,
          nettle_progress_func PROGRESS, unsigned P_BITS, unsigned
          Q_BITS)
     PUB and KEY is where the resulting key pair is stored. The structs
     should be initialized before you call this function.

     RANDOM_CTX and RANDOM is a randomness generator.
     `random(random_ctx, length, dst)' should generate `length' random
     octets and store them at `dst'. For advice, see *Note Randomness::.

     PROGRESS and PROGRESS_CTX can be used to get callbacks during the
     key generation process, in order to uphold an illusion of
     progress. PROGRESS can be NULL, in that case there are no
     callbacks.

     P_BITS and Q_BITS are the desired sizes of `p' and `q'. See
     `dsa_generate_keypair' for details.

6.7.3 Elliptic curves
---------------------

For cryptographic purposes, an elliptic curve is a mathematical group of
points, and computing logarithms in this group is computationally
difficult problem. Nettle uses additive notation for elliptic curve
groups. If P and Q are two points, and k is an integer, the point sum,
P + Q, and the multiple k P can be computed efficiently, but given only
two points P and Q, finding an integer k such that Q = k P is the
elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.

   Nettle supports standard curves which are all of the form y^2 = x^3
- 3 x + b (mod p), i.e., the points have coordinates (x,y), both
considered as integers modulo a specified prime p. Curves are
represented as a `struct ecc_curve'. It also supports curve25519, which
uses a different form of curve. Supported curves are declared in
`<nettle/ecc-curve.h>', e.g., `nettle_secp_256r1' for a standardized
curve using the 256-bit prime p = 2^256 - 2^224 + 2^192 + 2^96 - 1. The
contents of these structs is not visible to nettle users. The "bitsize
of the curve" is used as a shorthand for the bitsize of the curve's
prime p, e.g., 256 bits for `nettle_secp_256r1'.

6.7.3.1 Side-channel silence
............................

Nettle's implementation of the elliptic curve operations is intended to
be side-channel silent. The side-channel attacks considered are:

   * Timing attacks If the timing of operations depends on secret
     values, an attacker interacting with your system can measure the
     response time, and infer information about your secrets, e.g., a
     private signature key.

   * Attacks using memory caches Assume you have some secret data on a
     multi-user system, and that this data is properly protected so
     that other users get no direct access to it. If you have a process
     operating on the secret data, and this process does memory
     accesses depending on the data, e.g, an internal lookup table in
     some cryptographic algorithm, an attacker running a separate
     process on the same system may use behavior of internal CPU caches
     to get information about your secrets.

   Nettle's ECC implementation is designed to be "side-channel silent",
and not leak any information to these attacks. Timing and memory
accesses depend only on the size of the input data and its location in
memory, not on the actual data bits. This implies a performance penalty
in several of the building blocks.

6.7.3.2 ECDSA
.............

ECDSA is a variant of the DSA digital signature scheme (*note DSA::),
which works over an elliptic curve group rather than over a (subgroup
of) integers modulo p. Like DSA, creating a signature requires a unique
random nonce (repeating the nonce with two different messages reveals
the private key, and any leak or bias in the generation of the nonce
also leaks information about the key).

   Unlike DSA, signatures are in general not tied to any particular hash
function or even hash size. Any hash function can be used, and the hash
value is truncated or padded as needed to get a size matching the curve
being used. It is recommended to use a strong cryptographic hash
function with digest size close to the bit size of the curve, e.g.,
SHA256 is a reasonable choice when using ECDSA signature over the curve
secp256r1. A protocol or application using ECDSA has to specify which
curve and which hash function to use, or provide some mechanism for
negotiating.

   Nettle defines ECDSA in `<nettle/ecdsa.h>'. We first need to define
the data types used to represent public and private keys.

 -- struct: struct ecc_point
     Represents a point on an elliptic curve. In particular, it is used
     to represent an ECDSA public key.

 -- Function: void ecc_point_init (struct ecc_point *P, const
          structecc_curve *ECC)
     Initializes P to represent points on the given curve ECC.
     Allocates storage for the coordinates, using the same allocation
     functions as GMP.

 -- Function: void ecc_point_clear (struct ecc_point *P)
     Deallocate storage.

 -- Function: int ecc_point_set (struct ecc_point *P, const mpz_t X,
          const mpz_t Y)
     Check that the given coordinates represent a point on the curve.
     If so, the coordinates are copied and converted to internal
     representation, and the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns
     0. Currently, the infinity point (or zero point, with additive
     notation) i snot allowed.

 -- Function: void ecc_point_get (const struct ecc_point *P, mpz_t X,
          mpz_t Y)
     Extracts the coordinate of the point P. The output parameters X or
     Y may be NULL if the caller doesn't want that coordinate.

 -- struct: struct ecc_scalar
     Represents an integer in the range 0 < x < group order, where the
     "group order" refers to the order of an ECC group. In particular,
     it is used to represent an ECDSA private key.

 -- Function: void ecc_scalar_init (struct ecc_scalar *S, const struct
          ecc_curve *ECC)
     Initializes S to represent a scalar suitable for the given curve
     ECC. Allocates storage using the same allocation functions as GMP.

 -- Function: void ecc_scalar_clear (struct ecc_scalar *S)
     Deallocate storage.

 -- Function: int ecc_scalar_set (struct ecc_scalar *S, const mpz_t Z)
     Check that Z is in the correct range. If so, copies the value to S
     and returns 1, otherwise returns 0.

 -- Function: void ecc_scalar_get (const struct ecc_scalar *S, mpz_t Z)
     Extracts the scalar, in GMP `mpz_t' representation.

   To create and verify ECDSA signatures, the following functions are
used.

 -- Function: void ecdsa_sign (const struct ecc_scalar *KEY, void
          *RANDOM_CTX, nettle_random_func *RANDOM, size_t
          DIGEST_LENGTH, const uint8_t *DIGEST, struct dsa_signature
          *SIGNATURE)
     Uses the private key KEY to create a signature on DIGEST.
     RANDOM_CTX and RANDOM is a randomness generator.
     `random(random_ctx, length, dst)' should generate `length' random
     octets and store them at `dst'. The signature is stored in
     SIGNATURE, in the same was as for plain DSA.

 -- Function: int ecdsa_verify (const struct ecc_point *PUB, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *DIGEST, const struct dsa_signature
          *SIGNATURE)
     Uses the public key PUB to verify that SIGNATURE is a valid
     signature for the message digest DIGEST (of LENGTH octets).
     Returns 1 if the signature is valid, otherwise 0.

   Finally, to generation of new an ECDSA key pairs

 -- Function: void ecdsa_generate_keypair (struct ecc_point *PUB,
          struct ecc_scalar *KEY, void *RANDOM_CTX, nettle_random_func
          *RANDOM);
     PUB and KEY is where the resulting key pair is stored. The structs
     should be initialized, for the desired ECC curve, before you call
     this function.

     RANDOM_CTX and RANDOM is a randomness generator.
     `random(random_ctx, length, dst)' should generate `length' random
     octets and store them at `dst'. For advice, see *Note Randomness::.

6.7.3.3 Curve25519
..................

Curve25519 is an elliptic curve of Montgomery type, y^2 = x^3 + 486662
x^2 + x (mod p), with p = 2^255 - 19. Montgomery curves have the
advantage of simple and efficient point addition based on the
x-coordinate only. This particular curve was proposed by D.~J.~Bernstein
in 2006, for fast Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The group generator is
defined by x = 9 (there are actually two points with x = 9, differing
by the sign of the y-coordinate, but that doesn't matter for the
curve25519 operations which work with the x-coordinate only).

   The curve25519 functions are defined as operations on octet strings,
which are interpreted as x-coordinates in little-endian byte order.

   Of all the possible input strings, only about half correspond to
points on curve25519, i.e., a value that can be produced by
`curve25519_mul_g'. The other half corresponds to points on a related
"twist curve". The current implementation of `curve25519_mul' uses a
Montgomery ladder for the scalar multiplication, as suggested in the
curve25519 literature, and produces a well defined output for all
possible inputs, no matter if points are on the proper curve or on its
twist. However, at the time of writing, it is not yet ruled out that
other implementations could be faster, and therefore the behaviour for
inputs corresponding to points on the twist curve must be considered an
implementation idiosyncrasy, and may change in future versions.

 -- Constant: CURVE25519_SIZE
     The size of the strings representing curve25519 points and
     scalars, 32.

 -- Function: void curve25519_mul_g (uint8_t *Q, const uint8_t *N)
     Computes Q = N G, where G is the group generator and N is an
     integer. The input argument N and the output argument Q use a
     little-endian representation of the scalar and the x-coordinate,
     respectively. They are both of size `CURVE25519_SIZE'.

     This function is intended to be compatible with the function
     `crypto_scalar_mult_base' in the NaCl library.

 -- Function: void curve25519_mul (uint8_t *Q, const uint8_t *N, const
          uint8_t *P)
     Computes Q = N P, where P is an input point and N is an integer.
     The input arguments N and P and the output argument Q use a
     little-endian representation of the scalar and the x-coordinates,
     respectively. They are all of size `CURVE25519_SIZE'.

     The output value is defined only when the input P is a string
     produced by `curve25519_mul_g'. (See discussion above, about the
     twist curve).

     This function is intended to be compatible with the function
     `crypto_scalar_mult' in the NaCl library.

6.7.3.4 EdDSA
.............

EdDSA is a signature scheme proposed by D.~J.~Bernstein et al. in 2011.
It is defined using a "Twisted Edwards curve", of the form -x^2 + y^2 =
1 + d x^2 y^2. The specific signature scheme Ed25519 uses a curve which
is equivalent to curve25519: The two groups used differ only by a
simple change of coordinates, so that the discrete logarithm problem is
of equal difficulty in both groups.

   Unlike other signature schemes in Nettle, the input to the EdDSA sign
and verify functions is the possibly large message itself, not a hash
digest. EdDSA is a variant of Schnorr signatures, where the message is
hashed together with other data during the signature process, providing
resilience to hash-collisions: A successful attack finding collisions in
the hash function does not automatically translate into an attack to
forge signatures. EdDSA also avoids the use of a randomness source by
generating the needed signature nonce from a hash of the private key and
the message, which means that the message is actually hashed twice when
creating a signature. If signing huge messages, it is possible to hash
the message first and pass the short message digest as input to the sign
and verify functions, however, the resilience to hash collision is then
lost.

 -- Constant: ED25519_KEY_SIZE
     The size of a private or public Ed25519 key, 32 octets.

 -- Constant: ED25519_SIGNATURE_SIZE
     The size of an Ed25519 signature, 64 octets.

 -- Function: void ed25519_sha512_public_key (uint8_t *PUB, const
          uint8_t *PRIV)
     Computes the public key corresponding to the given private key.
     Both input and output are of size `ED25519_KEY_SIZE'.

 -- Function: void ed25519_sha512_sign (const uint8_t *PUB, const
          uint8_t *PRIV, size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *MSG, uint8_t
          *SIGNATURE)
     Signs a message using the provided key pair.

 -- Function: int ed25519_sha512_verify (const uint8_t *PUB, size_t
          LENGTH, const uint8_t *MSG, const uint8_t *SIGNATURE)
     Verifies a message using the provided public key. Returns 1 if the
     signature is valid, otherwise 0.

6.8 Randomness
==============

A crucial ingredient in many cryptographic contexts is randomness: Let
`p' be a random prime, choose a random initialization vector `iv', a
random key `k' and a random exponent `e', etc. In the theories, it is
assumed that you have plenty of randomness around.  If this assumption
is not true in practice, systems that are otherwise perfectly secure,
can be broken. Randomness has often turned out to be the weakest link
in the chain.

   In non-cryptographic applications, such as games as well as
scientific simulation, a good randomness generator usually means a
generator that has good statistical properties, and is seeded by some
simple function of things like the current time, process id, and host
name.

   However, such a generator is inadequate for cryptography, for at
least two reasons:

   * It's too easy for an attacker to guess the initial seed. Even if
     it will take some 2^32 tries before he guesses right, that's far
     too easy. For example, if the process id is 16 bits, the
     resolution of "current time" is one second, and the attacker knows
     what day the generator was seeded, there are only about 2^32
     possibilities to try if all possible values for the process id and
     time-of-day are tried.

   * The generator output reveals too much. By observing only a small
     segment of the generator's output, its internal state can be
     recovered, and from there, all previous output and all future
     output can be computed by the attacker.

   A randomness generator that is used for cryptographic purposes must
have better properties. Let's first look at the seeding, as the issues
here are mostly independent of the rest of the generator. The initial
state of the generator (its seed) must be unguessable by the attacker.
So what's unguessable? It depends on what the attacker already knows.
The concept used in information theory to reason about such things is
called "entropy", or "conditional entropy" (not to be confused with the
thermodynamic concept with the same name). A reasonable requirement is
that the seed contains a conditional entropy of at least some 80-100
bits. This property can be explained as follows: Allow the attacker to
ask `n' yes-no-questions, of his own choice, about the seed. If the
attacker, using this question-and-answer session, as well as any other
information he knows about the seeding process, still can't guess the
seed correctly, then the conditional entropy is more than `n' bits.

   Let's look at an example. Say information about timing of received
network packets is used in the seeding process. If there is some random
network traffic going on, this will contribute some bits of entropy or
"unguessability" to the seed. However, if the attacker can listen in to
the local network, or if all but a small number of the packets were
transmitted by machines that the attacker can monitor, this additional
information makes the seed easier for the attacker to figure out. Even
if the information is exactly the same, the conditional entropy, or
unguessability, is smaller for an attacker that knows some of it already
before the hypothetical question-and-answer session.

   Seeding of good generators is usually based on several sources. The
key point here is that the amount of unguessability that each source
contributes, depends on who the attacker is. Some sources that have been
used are:

High resolution timing of i/o activities
     Such as completed blocks from spinning hard disks, network
     packets, etc.  Getting access to such information is quite system
     dependent, and not all systems include suitable hardware. If
     available, it's one of the better randomness source one can find
     in a digital, mostly predictable, computer.

User activity
     Timing and contents of user interaction events is another popular
     source that is available for interactive programs (even if I
     suspect that it is sometimes used in order to make the user feel
     good, not because the quality of the input is needed or used
     properly). Obviously, not available when a machine is unattended.
     Also beware of networks: User interaction that happens across a
     long serial cable, TELNET session, or even SSH session may be
     visible to an attacker, in full or partially.

Audio input
     Any room, or even a microphone input that's left unconnected, is a
     source of some random background noise, which can be fed into the
     seeding process.

Specialized hardware
     Hardware devices with the sole purpose of generating random data
     have been designed. They range from radioactive samples with an
     attached Geiger counter, to amplification of the inherent noise in
     electronic components such as diodes and resistors, to
     low-frequency sampling of chaotic systems. Hashing successive
     images of a Lava lamp is a spectacular example of the latter type.

Secret information
     Secret information, such as user passwords or keys, or private
     files stored on disk, can provide some unguessability. A problem
     is that if the information is revealed at a later time, the
     unguessability vanishes. Another problem is that this kind of
     information tends to be fairly constant, so if you rely on it and
     seed your generator regularly, you risk constructing almost
     similar seeds or even constructing the same seed more than once.

   For all practical sources, it's difficult but important to provide a
reliable lower bound on the amount of unguessability that it provides.
Two important points are to make sure that the attacker can't observe
your sources (so if you like the Lava lamp idea, remember that you have
to get your own lamp, and not put it by a window or anywhere else where
strangers can see it), and that hardware failures are detected. What if
the bulb in the Lava lamp, which you keep locked into a cupboard
following the above advice, breaks after a few months?

   So let's assume that we have been able to find an unguessable seed,
which contains at least 80 bits of conditional entropy, relative to all
attackers that we care about (typically, we must at the very least
assume that no attacker has root privileges on our machine).

   How do we generate output from this seed, and how much can we get?
Some generators (notably the Linux `/dev/random' generator) tries to
estimate available entropy and restrict the amount of output. The goal
is that if you read 128 bits from `/dev/random', you should get 128
"truly random" bits. This is a property that is useful in some
specialized circumstances, for instance when generating key material for
a one time pad, or when working with unconditional blinding, but in most
cases, it doesn't matter much. For most application, there's no limit on
the amount of useful "random" data that we can generate from a small
seed; what matters is that the seed is unguessable and that the
generator has good cryptographic properties.

   At the heart of all generators lies its internal state. Future output
is determined by the internal state alone. Let's call it the generator's
key. The key is initialized from the unguessable seed. Important
properties of a generator are:

"Key-hiding"
     An attacker observing the output should not be able to recover the
     generator's key.

"Independence of outputs"
     Observing some of the output should not help the attacker to guess
     previous or future output.

"Forward secrecy"
     Even if an attacker compromises the generator's key, he should not
     be able to guess the generator output _before_ the key compromise.

"Recovery from key compromise"
     If an attacker compromises the generator's key, he can compute
     _all_ future output. This is inevitable if the generator is seeded
     only once, at startup. However, the generator can provide a
     reseeding mechanism, to achieve recovery from key compromise. More
     precisely: If the attacker compromises the key at a particular
     time `t_1', there is another later time `t_2', such that if the
     attacker observes all output generated between `t_1' and `t_2', he
     still can't guess what output is generated after `t_2'.


   Nettle includes one randomness generator that is believed to have all
the above properties, and two simpler ones.

   ARCFOUR, like any stream cipher, can be used as a randomness
generator. Its output should be of reasonable quality, if the seed is
hashed properly before it is used with `arcfour_set_key'. There's no
single natural way to reseed it, but if you need reseeding, you should
be using Yarrow instead.

   The "lagged Fibonacci" generator in `<nettle/knuth-lfib.h>' is a
fast generator with good statistical properties, but is *not* for
cryptographic use, and therefore not documented here. It is included
mostly because the Nettle test suite needs to generate some test data
from a small seed.

   The recommended generator to use is Yarrow, described below.

6.8.1 Yarrow
------------

Yarrow is a family of pseudo-randomness generators, designed for
cryptographic use, by John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier and Niels Ferguson.
Yarrow-160 is described in a paper at
`http://www.counterpane.com/yarrow.html', and it uses SHA1 and
triple-DES, and has a 160-bit internal state. Nettle implements
Yarrow-256, which is similar, but uses SHA256 and AES to get an
internal state of 256 bits.

   Yarrow was an almost finished project, the paper mentioned above is
the closest thing to a specification for it, but some smaller details
are left out. There is no official reference implementation or test
cases.  This section includes an overview of Yarrow, but for the
details of Yarrow-256, as implemented by Nettle, you have to consult
the source code. Maybe a complete specification can be written later.

   Yarrow can use many sources (at least two are needed for proper
reseeding), and two randomness "pools", referred to as the "slow pool"
and the "fast pool". Input from the sources is fed alternatingly into
the two pools. When one of the sources has contributed 100 bits of
entropy to the fast pool, a "fast reseed" happens and the fast pool is
mixed into the internal state. When at least two of the sources have
contributed at least 160 bits each to the slow pool, a "slow reseed"
takes place. The contents of both pools are mixed into the internal
state. These procedures should ensure that the generator will eventually
recover after a key compromise.

   The output is generated by using AES to encrypt a counter, using the
generator's current key. After each request for output, another 256
bits are generated which replace the key. This ensures forward secrecy.

   Yarrow can also use a "seed file" to save state across restarts.
Yarrow is seeded by either feeding it the contents of the previous seed
file, or feeding it input from its sources until a slow reseed happens.

   Nettle defines Yarrow-256 in `<nettle/yarrow.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct yarrow256_ctx

 -- Context struct: struct yarrow_source
     Information about a single source.

 -- Constant: YARROW256_SEED_FILE_SIZE
     Recommended size of the Yarrow-256 seed file.

 -- Function: void yarrow256_init (struct yarrow256_ctx *CTX, unsigned
          NSOURCES, struct yarrow_source *SOURCES)
     Initializes the yarrow context, and its NSOURCES sources. It's
     possible to call it with NSOURCES=0 and SOURCES=NULL, if you don't
     need the update features.

 -- Function: void yarrow256_seed (struct yarrow256_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *SEED_FILE)
     Seeds Yarrow-256 from a previous seed file. LENGTH should be at
     least `YARROW256_SEED_FILE_SIZE', but it can be larger.

     The generator will trust you that the SEED_FILE data really is
     unguessable. After calling this function, you _must_ overwrite the
     old seed file with newly generated data from `yarrow256_random'.
     If it's possible for several processes to read the seed file at
     about the same time, access must be coordinated using some locking
     mechanism.

 -- Function: int yarrow256_update (struct yarrow256_ctx *CTX, unsigned
          SOURCE, unsigned ENTROPY, size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *DATA)
     Updates the generator with data from source SOURCE (an index that
     must be smaller than the number of sources). ENTROPY is your
     estimated lower bound for the entropy in the data, measured in
     bits.  Calling update with zero ENTROPY is always safe, no matter
     if the data is random or not.

     Returns 1 if a reseed happened, in which case an application using
     a seed file may want to generate new seed data with
     `yarrow256_random' and overwrite the seed file. Otherwise, the
     function returns 0.

 -- Function: void yarrow256_random (struct yarrow256_ctx *CTX, size_t
          LENGTH, uint8_t *DST)
     Generates LENGTH octets of output. The generator must be seeded
     before you call this function.

     If you don't need forward secrecy, e.g. if you need non-secret
     randomness for initialization vectors or padding, you can gain some
     efficiency by buffering, calling this function for reasonably large
     blocks of data, say 100-1000 octets at a time.

 -- Function: int yarrow256_is_seeded (struct yarrow256_ctx *CTX)
     Returns 1 if the generator is seeded and ready to generate output,
     otherwise 0.

 -- Function: unsigned yarrow256_needed_sources (struct yarrow256_ctx
          *CTX)
     Returns the number of sources that must reach the threshold before
     a slow reseed will happen. Useful primarily when the generator is
     unseeded.

 -- Function: void yarrow256_fast_reseed (struct yarrow256_ctx *CTX)
 -- Function: void yarrow256_slow_reseed (struct yarrow256_ctx *CTX)
     Causes a fast or slow reseed to take place immediately, regardless
     of the current entropy estimates of the two pools. Use with care.

   Nettle includes an entropy estimator for one kind of input source:
User keyboard input.

 -- Context struct: struct yarrow_key_event_ctx
     Information about recent key events.

 -- Function: void yarrow_key_event_init (struct yarrow_key_event_ctx
          *CTX)
     Initializes the context.

 -- Function: unsigned yarrow_key_event_estimate (struct
          yarrow_key_event_ctx *CTX, unsigned KEY, unsigned TIME)
     KEY is the id of the key (ASCII value, hardware key code, X
     keysym, ..., it doesn't matter), and TIME is the timestamp of the
     event. The time must be given in units matching the resolution by
     which you read the clock. If you read the clock with microsecond
     precision, TIME should be provided in units of microseconds. But
     if you use `gettimeofday' on a typical Unix system where the clock
     ticks 10 or so microseconds at a time, TIME should be given in
     units of 10 microseconds.

     Returns an entropy estimate, in bits, suitable for calling
     `yarrow256_update'. Usually, 0, 1 or 2 bits.

6.9 ASCII encoding
==================

Encryption will transform your data from text into binary format, and
that may be a problem if, for example, you want to send the data as if
it was plain text in an email, or store it along with descriptive text
in a file. You may then use an encoding from binary to text: each
binary byte is translated into a number of bytes of plain text.

   A base-N encoding of data is one representation of data that only
uses N different symbols (instead of the 256 possible values of a byte).

   The base64 encoding will always use alphanumeric (upper and lower
case) characters and the '+', '/' and '=' symbols to represent the
data. Four output characters are generated for each three bytes of
input. In case the length of the input is not a multiple of three,
padding characters are added at the end. There's also a "URL safe"
variant, which is useful for encoding binary data into URLs and
filenames. See `RFC 4648'.

   The base16 encoding, also known as "hexadecimal", uses the decimal
digits and the letters from A to F. Two hexadecimal digits are generated
for each input byte.

   Nettle supports both base64 and base16 encoding and decoding.

   Encoding and decoding uses a context struct to maintain its state
(with the exception of base16 encoding, which doesn't need any). To
encode or decode the data, first initialize the context, then call the
update function as many times as necessary, and complete the operation
by calling the final function.

   The following functions can be used to perform base64 encoding and
decoding.  They are defined in `<nettle/base64.h>'.

 -- Context struct: struct base64_encode_ctx

 -- Function: void base64_encode_init (struct base64_encode_ctx *CTX)
 -- Function: void base64url_encode_init (struct base64_encode_ctx *CTX)
     Initializes a base64 context. This is necessary before starting an
     encoding session. `base64_encode_init' selects the standard base64
     alphabet, while `base64url_encode_init' selects the URL safe
     alphabet.

 -- Function: size_t base64_encode_single (struct base64_encode_ctx
          *CTX, uint8_t *DST, uint8_t SRC)
     Encodes a single byte. Returns amount of output (always 1 or 2).

 -- Macro: BASE64_ENCODE_LENGTH (LENGTH)
     The maximum number of output bytes when passing LENGTH input bytes
     to `base64_encode_update'.

 -- Function: size_t base64_encode_update (struct base64_encode_ctx
          *CTX, uint8_t *DST, size_t LENGTH, const uint8_t *SRC)
     After CTX is initialized, this function may be called to encode
     LENGTH bytes from SRC. The result will be placed in DST, and the
     return value will be the number of bytes generated. Note that DST
     must be at least of size BASE64_ENCODE_LENGTH(LENGTH).

 -- Constant: BASE64_ENCODE_FINAL_LENGTH
     The maximum amount of output from `base64_encode_final'.

 -- Function: size_t base64_encode_final (struct base64_encode_ctx
          *CTX, uint8_t *DST)
     After calling base64_encode_update one or more times, this function
     should be called to generate the final output bytes, including any
     needed paddding. The return value is the number of output bytes
     generated.

 -- Context struct: struct base64_decode_ctx

 -- Function: void base64_decode_init (struct base64_decode_ctx *CTX)
 -- Function: void base64url_decode_init (struct base64_decode_ctx *CTX)
     Initializes a base64 decoding context. This is necessary before
     starting a decoding session. `base64_decode_init' selects the
     standard base64 alphabet, while `base64url_decode_init' selects
     the URL safe alphabet.

 -- Function: int base64_decode_single (struct base64_decode_ctx *CTX,
          uint8_t *DST, uint8_t SRC)
     Decodes a single byte (SRC) and stores the result in DST.  Returns
     amount of output (0 or 1), or -1 on errors.

 -- Macro: BASE64_DECODE_LENGTH (LENGTH)
     The maximum number of output bytes when passing LENGTH input bytes
     to `base64_decode_update'.

 -- Function: void base64_decode_update (struct base64_decode_ctx *CTX,
          size_t *DST_LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, size_t SRC_LENGTH, const
          uint8_t *SRC)
     After CTX is initialized, this function may be called to decode
     SRC_LENGTH bytes from SRC. DST should point to an area of size at
     least BASE64_DECODE_LENGTH(SRC_LENGTH). The amount of data
     generated is returned in *DST_LENGTH. Returns 1 on success and 0
     on error.

 -- Function: int base64_decode_final (struct base64_decode_ctx *CTX)
     Check that final padding is correct. Returns 1 on success, and 0 on
     error.

   Similarly to the base64 functions, the following functions perform
base16 encoding, and are defined in `<nettle/base16.h>'. Note that
there is no encoding context necessary for doing base16 encoding.

 -- Function: void base16_encode_single (uint8_t *DST, uint8_t SRC)
     Encodes a single byte. Always stores two digits in DST[0] and
     DST[1].

 -- Macro: BASE16_ENCODE_LENGTH (LENGTH)
     The number of output bytes when passing LENGTH input bytes to
     `base16_encode_update'.

 -- Function: void base16_encode_update (uint8_t *DST, size_t LENGTH,
          const uint8_t *SRC)
     Always stores BASE16_ENCODE_LENGTH(LENGTH) digits in DST.

 -- Context struct: struct base16_decode_ctx

 -- Function: void base16_decode_init (struct base16_decode_ctx *CTX)
     Initializes a base16 decoding context. This is necessary before
     starting a decoding session.

 -- Function: int base16_decode_single (struct base16_decode_ctx *CTX,
          uint8_t *DST, uint8_t SRC)
     Decodes a single byte from SRC into DST. Returns amount of output
     (0 or 1), or -1 on errors.

 -- Macro: BASE16_DECODE_LENGTH (LENGTH)
     The maximum number of output bytes when passing LENGTH input bytes
     to `base16_decode_update'.

 -- Function: int base16_decode_update (struct base16_decode_ctx *CTX,
          size_t *DST_LENGTH, uint8_t *DST, size_t SRC_LENGTH, const
          uint8_t *SRC)
     After CTX is initialized, this function may be called to decode
     SRC_LENGTH bytes from SRC. DST should point to an area of size at
     least BASE16_DECODE_LENGTH(SRC_LENGTH). The amount of data
     generated is returned in *DST_LENGTH. Returns 1 on success and 0
     on error.

 -- Function: int base16_decode_final (struct base16_decode_ctx *CTX)
     Checks that the end of data is correct (i.e., an even number of
     hexadecimal digits have been seen). Returns 1 on success, and 0 on
     error.

6.10 Miscellaneous functions
============================

 -- Function: void * memxor (void *DST, const void *SRC, size_t N)
     XORs the source area on top of the destination area. The interface
     doesn't follow the Nettle conventions, because it is intended to be
     similar to the ANSI-C `memcpy' function.

 -- Function: void * memxor3 (void *DST, const void *A, const void *B,
          size_t N)
     Like `memxor', but takes two source areas and separate destination
     area.

   `memxor' is declared in `<nettle/memxor.h>'.


File: nettle.info,  Node: Compatibility functions,  Prev: Miscellaneous functions,  Up: Reference

6.11 Compatibility functions
============================

For convenience, Nettle includes alternative interfaces to some
algorithms, for compatibility with some other popular crypto toolkits.
These are not fully documented here; refer to the source or to the
documentation for the original implementation.

   MD5 is defined in [RFC 1321], which includes a reference
implementation.  Nettle defines a compatible interface to MD5 in
`<nettle/md5-compat.h>'. This file defines the typedef `MD5_CTX', and
declares the functions `MD5Init', `MD5Update' and `MD5Final'.

   Eric Young's "libdes" (also part of OpenSSL) is a quite popular DES
implementation. Nettle includes a subset if its interface in
`<nettle/des-compat.h>'. This file defines the typedefs
`des_key_schedule' and `des_cblock', two constants `DES_ENCRYPT' and
`DES_DECRYPT', and declares one global variable `des_check_key', and
the functions `des_cbc_cksum' `des_cbc_encrypt', `des_ecb2_encrypt',
`des_ecb3_encrypt', `des_ecb_encrypt', `des_ede2_cbc_encrypt',
`des_ede3_cbc_encrypt', `des_is_weak_key', `des_key_sched',
`des_ncbc_encrypt' `des_set_key', and `des_set_odd_parity'.

7 Traditional Nettle Soup
*************************

For the serious nettle hacker, here is a recipe for nettle soup. 4
servings.

     1 liter fresh nettles (urtica dioica)

     2 tablespoons butter

     3 tablespoons flour

     1 liter stock (meat or vegetable)

     1/2 teaspoon salt

     a tad white pepper

     some cream or milk

   Gather 1 liter fresh nettles. Use gloves! Small, tender shoots are
preferable but the tops of larger nettles can also be used.

   Rinse the nettles very well. Boil them for 10 minutes in lightly
salted water. Strain the nettles and save the water. Hack the nettles.
Melt the butter and mix in the flour. Dilute with stock and the
nettle-water you saved earlier. Add the hacked nettles. If you wish you
can add some milk or cream at this stage. Bring to a boil and let boil
for a few minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

   Serve with boiled egg-halves.

8 Installation
**************

Nettle uses `autoconf'. To build it, unpack the source and run

     ./configure
     make
     make check
     make install

to install it under the default prefix, `/usr/local'. Using GNU make is
strongly recommended. By default, both static and shared libraries are
built and installed.

   To get a list of configure options, use `./configure --help'. Some
of the more interesting are:

`--enable-fat'
     Include multiple versions of certain functions in the library, and
     select the ones to use at run-time, depending on available
     processor features. Supported for ARM and x86_64.

`--enable-mini-gmp'
     Use the smaller and slower "mini-gmp" implementation of the bignum
     functions needed for public-key cryptography, instead of the real
     GNU GMP library. This option is intended primarily for smaller
     embedded systems. Note that builds using mini-gmp are *not* binary
     compatible with regular builds of Nettle, and more likely to leak
     side-channel information.

`--disable-shared'
     Omit building the shared libraries.

`--disable-dependency-tracking'
     Disable the automatic dependency tracking. You will likely need
     this option to be able to build with BSD make.
