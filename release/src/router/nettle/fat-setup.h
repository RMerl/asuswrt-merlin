/* Fat library initialization works as follows. The main function is
   fat_init. We try to do initialization only once, but since it is
   idempotent, there's no harm if it is in some cases called multiple
   times from several threads. For correctness, we rely on atomic
   writes, but not on memory barriers or any other synchronization
   mechanism.

   The fat_init function checks the cpuid flags, and sets function
   pointers, e.g, _nettle_aes_encrypt_vec, to point to the appropriate
   implementation.

   To get everything hooked in, we use a belt-and-suspenders approach.

   We try to register fat_init as a constructor function to be called
   at load time. If this is unavailable or non-working, we instead
   arrange fat_init to be called lazily.

   For the actual indirection, there are two cases. 

   * If ifunc support is available, function pointers are statically
     initialized to NULL, and we register resolver functions, e.g.,
     _nettle_aes_encrypt_resolve, which call fat_init, and then return
     the function pointer, e.g., the value of _nettle_aes_encrypt_vec.

   * If ifunc is not available, we have to define a wrapper function
     to jump via the function pointer. (FIXME: For internal calls, we
     could do this as a macro).

     We statically initialize each function pointer to point to a
     special initialization function, e.g., _nettle_aes_encrypt_init,
     which calls fat_init, and then invokes the right function. This
     way, all pointers are setup correctly at the first call to any
     fat function.

     And atomic writes are required for correctness in the case that
     several threads do "first call to any fat function" at the same
     time.
