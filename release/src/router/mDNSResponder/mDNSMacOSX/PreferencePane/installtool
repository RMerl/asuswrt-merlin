# <rdar://problem/4138070> ddnswriteconfig (Bonjour PreferencePane) vulnerability
# Added separate "installtool" script instead of making ddnswriteconfig self-install
#
# Create the Bonjour subdirectory.
# Copy ARGV[0] to $dest and set owner and suid permissions.
#
# This script will be run as root by the AEWP trampoline.

# but it is run as root when properly authorized by a user with an admin password,
# via the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges() call.
# We therefore have to do this trick pattern match to 'untaint' the source file specified in $ARGV[0].
