DESIGN CREDITS:

some of the idea inside Jim are the fruit of long discussions
inside the Tclers chat room. The feedback of the Tcl
comunity in general, and of the members of the Tcl Core Team, was
very important to avoid mistakes: I used the great experience of
this people as a test for some of the ideas I put into Jim.
Bad ideas tend to be demolished in no time by good engineers.

Also the following ideas are due to the following authors:

- Jim locals were originally proposed by Miguel Sofer, I (SS) added
  the feature that make they similar to lexical scoped closures
  using capturing of the local variables value if no explicit
  intialization is provided.

- The [lmap] command is my (SS) design, but I incorporated inside the
  command an interesting idea of Donal K. Fellows that proposed that
  the [continue] command may be used to skip the accumulation of the
  current-iteartion result, providing in one command the power of
  [map] and [filter] together.
