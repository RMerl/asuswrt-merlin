    <para>This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit 
    permissions that will <emphasis>always</emphasis> be set on a 
    file created by Samba. This is done by bitwise 'OR'ing these bits onto 
    the mode bits of a file that is being created or having its 
    permissions changed. The default for this parameter is (in octal) 
    000. The modes in this parameter are bitwise 'OR'ed onto the file 
    mode after the mask set in the <parameter moreinfo="none">create mask</parameter> 
    parameter is applied.</para>

	<para>The example below would force all created files to have read and execute 
    permissions set for 'group' and 'other' as well as the 
    read/write/execute bits set for the 'user'.</para>
