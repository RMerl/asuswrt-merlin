	Ever since Microsoft announced that it was discontinuing support for Windows
	NT4, Samba users started to ask for detailed instructions on how to migrate
	from NT4 to Samba-3. This chapter provides background information that should
	meet these needs.
	</p><p>
	One wonders how many NT4 systems will be left in service by the time you read this
	book though.
	</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2594439"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2594446"></a>
	Network administrators who want to migrate off a Windows NT4 environment know
	one thing with certainty. They feel that NT4 has been abandoned, and they want
	to update. The desire to get off NT4 and to not adopt Windows 200x and Active
	Directory is driven by a mixture of concerns over complexity, cost, fear of
	failure, and much more.
	</p><p>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594489"></a>
	The migration from NT4 to Samba-3 can involve a number of factors, including
	migration of data to another server, migration of network environment controls
	such as group policies, and migration of the users, groups, and machine
	accounts.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594506"></a>
	It should be pointed out now that it is possible to migrate some systems from
	a Windows NT4 domain environment to a Samba-3 domain environment. This is certainly
	not possible in every case. It is possible to just migrate the domain accounts
	to Samba-3 and then to switch machines, but as a hands-off transition, this is more
	the exception than the rule. Most systems require some tweaking after
	migration before an environment that is acceptable for immediate use
	is obtained.

	You are about to migrate an MS Windows NT4 domain accounts database to
	a Samba-3 server. The Samba-3 server is using a 
	<em class="parameter"><code>passdb backend</code></em> based on LDAP. The 
	<code class="constant">ldapsam</code> is ideal because an LDAP backend can be distributed
	for use with BDCs  generally essential for larger networks.
	</p><p>
	Your objective is to document the process of migrating user and group accounts
	from several NT4 domains into a single Samba-3 LDAP backend database.
	</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2594579"></a>Dissection and Discussion</h2></div></div></div><p>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594623"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594630"></a>
	The migration process takes a snapshot of information that is stored in the
	Windows NT4 registry-based accounts database. That information resides in
	the Security Account Manager (SAM) portion of the NT4 registry under keys called
	<code class="constant">SAM</code> and <code class="constant">SECURITY</code>.
	</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594654"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594661"></a>
	The Windows NT4 registry keys called <code class="constant">SAM</code> and <code class="constant">SECURITY</code>
	are protected so that you cannot view the contents. If you change the security setting
	to reveal the contents under these hive keys, your Windows NT4 domain is crippled. Do not
	do this unless you are willing to render your domain controller inoperative.

	Before commencing an NT4 to Samba-3 migration, you should consider what your objectives are.
	While in some cases it is possible simply to migrate an NT4 domain to a single Samba-3 server,
	that may not be a good idea from an administration perspective. Since the process involves going
	through a certain amount of disruptive activity anyhow, why not take this opportunity to
	review the structure of the network, how Windows clients are controlled and how they
	interact with the network environment.

	MS Windows NT4 was introduced some time around 1996. Many environments in which NT4 was deployed
	have done little to keep the NT4 server environment up to date with more recent Windows releases, 
	particularly Windows XP Professional. The migration provides opportunity to revise and update 
	roaming profile deployment as well as folder redirection. Given that you must port the 
	greater network configuration of this from the old NT4 server to the new Samba-3 server.
	Do not forget to validate the security descriptors in the profiles share as well as network logon
	scripts. Feedback from sites that are migrating to Samba-3 suggests that many are using this
	as a good time to update desktop systems also. In all, the extra effort should constitute no
	real disruption to users, but rather, with due diligence and care, should make their network experience
	a much happier one.

	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594780"></a>
	Migration of an NT4 domain user and group database to Samba-3 involves a certain strategic
	element. Many sites have asked for instructions regarding merging of multiple NT4
	domains into one Samba-3 LDAP database. It seems that this is viewed as a significant
	added value compared with the alternative of migration to Windows Server 200x and Active
	Directory. The diagram in <a class="link" href="ntmigration.html#ch8-migration" title="Figure 9.1. Schematic Explaining the net rpc vampire Process">&#8220;Schematic Explaining the net rpc vampire Process&#8221;</a> illustrates the effect of migration
	from a Windows NT4 domain to a Samba domain.
	</p><div class="figure"><a name="ch8-migration"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.1. Schematic Explaining the <code class="literal">net rpc vampire</code> Process</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/ch8-migration.png" width="297" alt="Schematic Explaining the net rpc vampire Process"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594853"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594860"></a>
	If you want to merge multiple NT4 domain account databases into one Samba domain,
	you must now dump the contents of the first migration and edit it as appropriate. Now clean
	out (remove) the tdbsam backend file (<code class="filename">passdb.tdb</code>) or the LDAP database
	files. You must start each migration with a new database into which you merge your NT4 
	domains.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2594880"></a>
	At this point, you are ready to perform the second migration, following the same steps as
	for the first. In other words, dump the database, edit it, and then you may merge the
	dump for the first and second migrations.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2594895"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2594903"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2594911"></a>
	You must be careful. If you choose to migrate to an LDAP backend, your dump file
	now contains the full account information, including the domain SID. The domain SID for each 
	of the two NT4 domains will be different. You must choose one and change the domain 
	portion of the account SIDs so that all are the same.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594929"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2594935"></a>

	<a class="indexterm" name="id2595004"></a>
	If you choose to use a tdbsam (<code class="filename">passdb.tdb</code>) backend file, your best choice
	is to use <code class="literal">pdbedit</code> to export the contents of the tdbsam file into an
	smbpasswd data file. This automatically strips out all domain-specific information,
	such as logon hours, logon machines, logon script, profile path, as well as the domain SID.
	The resulting file can be easily merged with other migration attempts (each of which must start
	with a clean file). It should also be noted that all users who end up in the merged smbpasswd
	file must have an account in <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>. The resulting smbpasswd file
	may be exported or imported into either a tdbsam (<code class="filename">passdb.tdb</code>) or
	an LDAP backend.

	The merging of multiple Windows NT4-style domains into a single LDAP-backend-based Samba-3
	domain may be seen by those who had power over them as a loss of prestige or a loss of
	power. The imposition of a single domain may even be seen as a threat. So in migrating and
	merging account databases, be consciously aware of the political fall-out in which you
	may find yourself entangled when key staff feel a loss of prestige.
	</p><p>
	The best advice that can be given to those who set out to merge NT4 domains into a single
	Samba-3 domain is to promote (sell) the action as one that reduces costs and delivers
	greater network interoperability and manageability.
	</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2595114"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div></div><p>
	From feedback on the Samba mailing lists, it seems that most Windows NT4 migrations
	to Samba-3 are being performed using a new server or a new installation of a Linux or UNIX
	server. If you contemplate doing this, please note that the steps that follow in this
	chapter assume familiarity with the information that has been previously covered in this
	book. You are particularly encouraged to be familiar with <a class="link" href="secure.html" title="Chapter 3. Secure Office Networking">&#8220;Secure Office Networking&#8221;</a>,
	<a class="link" href="Big500users.html" title="Chapter 4. The 500-User Office">&#8220;The 500-User Office&#8221;</a> and <a class="link" href="happy.html" title="Chapter 5. Making Happy Users">&#8220;Making Happy Users&#8221;</a>.
	</p><p>
	We present here the steps and example output for two NT4 to Samba-3 domain migrations. The
	first uses an LDAP-based backend, and the second uses a tdbsam backend. In each case the
	scripts you specify in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file for the <em class="parameter"><code>add user script</code></em>
	collection of parameters are used to effect the addition of accounts into the passdb backend.
	</p><p>
	Before proceeding to NT4 migration using either a tdbsam or ldapsam, it is most strongly recommended to
	review <a class="link" href="Big500users.html#ch5-dnshcp-setup" title="Installation of DHCP, DNS, and Samba Control Files">&#8220;Installation of DHCP, DNS, and Samba Control Files&#8221;</a> for DNS and DHCP configuration. The importance of correctly
	functioning name resolution must be recognized. This applies equally for both hostname and NetBIOS names
	(machine names, computer names, domain names, workgroup names  ALL names!).
	</p><p>
	The migration process involves the following steps:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		Prepare the target Samba-3 server. This involves configuring Samba-3 for
		migration to either a tdbsam or an ldapsam backend.

		<a class="indexterm" name="id2595208"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2595214"></a>
		Clean up the source NT4 PDC. Delete all accounts that need not be migrated.
		Delete all files that should not be migrated. Where possible, change NT group
		names so there are no spaces or uppercase characters. This is important if
		the target UNIX host insists on POSIX-compliant all lowercase user and group
		names.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Step through the migration process.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2595235"></a>
		Remove the NT4 PDC from the network.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Upgrade the Samba-3 server from a BDC to a PDC, and validate all account
		information.
		</p></li></ul></div><p>
	It may help to use the above outline as a pre-migration checklist.

	In this example, the migration is of an NT4 PDC to a Samba-3 PDC with an LDAP backend. The accounts about
	to be migrated are shown in <a class="link" href="ntmigration.html#NT4DUM" title="Figure 9.2. View of Accounts in NT4 Domain User Manager">&#8220;View of Accounts in NT4 Domain User Manager&#8221;</a>. In this example use is made of the
	smbldap-tools scripts to add the accounts that are migrated into the ldapsam passdb backend.
	Four scripts are essential to the migration process. Other scripts will be required
	for daily management, but these are not critical to migration. The critical scripts are dependant
	on which passdb backend is being used. Refer to <a class="link" href="ntmigration.html#ch8-vampire" title="Table 9.1. Samba smb.conf Scripts Essential to Samba Operation">&#8220;Samba smb.conf Scripts Essential to Samba Operation&#8221;</a> to see which scripts
	must be provided so that the migration process can complete.
	</p><p>
	Verify that you have correctly specified in the <code class="filename">smb.conf</code> file the scripts and arguments 
	that should be passed to them before attempting to perform the account migration. Note also
	that the deletion scripts must be commented out during migration. These should be uncommented
	following successful migration of the NT4 Domain accounts.
	</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>

		Restart the LDAP server following initialization of the LDAP directory. Execute the

</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> rcldap restart
<code class="prompt">root# </code> chkconfig ldap on

		Verify that the new user accounts that have been added to the LDAP directory can be
		resolved as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> getent passwd

		Set the new domain administrator (root) password for both UNIX and Windows as shown here:
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">root# </code> /opt/IDEALX/sbin/smbldap-passwd root
Changing password for root
New password : ********
Retype new password : ********
</pre><p>
		Note: During account migration, the Windows Administrator account will not be migrated
		to the Samba server.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Now validate that these accounts can be resolved using Samba's tools as

		This is a recommendation that permits the data from each NT4 domain to
		be kept separate until you are ready to merge them. Also, if you do not start with a clean database,
		you may find errors due to users or groups from multiple domains having the
		same name but different SIDs. It is better to permit each migration to complete
		without undue errors and then to handle the merging of vampired data under
		proper supervision.

		Yes, so long as the SID you create has the same structure as an autogenerated SID.
		The typical SID looks like this: S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX, where
		the XXXXXXXXXX can be any number with from 6 to 10 digits. On the other hand, why
		would you really want to create your own SID? I cannot think of a good reason.
		You may want to set the SID to one that is already in use somewhere on your network,
		but that is a little different from straight out creating your own domain SID.

		Samba-3 must be able to tie all user and group account SIDs to a UNIX UID or GID. Samba
		does not fabricate the UNIX IDs from thin air, but rather requires them to be located
		in a suitable place. 
		</p><p>
		When migrating a <code class="filename">smbpasswd</code> file to an LDAP backend, the
		UID of each account is taken together with the account information in the 
		<code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, and both sets of data are used to create the account
		entry in the LDAP database. 
		</p><p>
		If you elect to create the POSIX account also, the entire UNIX account is copied to the 
		LDAP backend. The same occurs with NT groups and UNIX groups. At the conclusion of 
		migration to the LDAP database, the accounts may be removed from the UNIX database files. 
		In short then, all UNIX and Windows networking accounts, both in tdbsam as well as in 
		LDAP, require UIDs/GIDs.

		If you have 10 tdbsam Samba domains, there is considerable risk that there are a number of
		accounts that have the same UNIX identifier (UID/GID). This means that you almost 
		certainly have to edit a lot of data. It would be easiest to dump each database in smbpasswd
		file format and then manually edit all records to ensure that each has a unique UID. Each
		file can then be imported a number of ways. You can use the <code class="literal">pdbedit</code> tool
		to affect a transfer from the smbpasswd file to LDAP, or you can migrate them en masse to
		tdbsam and then to LDAP. The final choice is yours. Just remember to verify all accounts that
		you have migrated before handing over access to a user. After all, too many users with a bad
		migration experience may threaten your career.

		I would recommend not to migrate the machine account. The machine accounts should still work, but there are registry entries
		on each Windows NT4 and upward client that have a tattoo of the old domain name. If you
		unjoin the domain and then rejoin the newly renamed Samba-3 domain, you can be certain to avoid

		Samba-3 currently does not implement multiple group membership internally. If you use the Windows 
		NT4 Domain User Manager to manage accounts and you have an LDAP backend, the multiple group
		membership is stored in the POSIX groups area. If you use either tdbsam or smbpasswd backend,
		then multiple group membership is handled through the UNIX groups file. When you dump the user
		accounts, no group account information is provided. When you edit (change) UIDs and GIDs in each
		file to which you migrated the NT4 Domain data, do not forget to edit the UNIX <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>
		and <code class="filename">/etc/group</code> information also. That is where the multiple group information
		is most closely at your fingertips.

		A Windows 200x group name can be up to 254 characters long, while in Windows NT4 the group
		name is limited to 20 characters. Most UNIX systems limit this to 32 characters. Windows 
		groups can contain upper- and lowercase characters, as well as spaces.
		Many UNIX system do not permit the use of uppercase characters, and some do not permit the
		space character either. A number of systems (i.e., Linux) work fine with both uppercase
		and space characters in group names, but the shadow-utils package that provides the group
		control functions (<code class="literal">groupadd</code>, <code class="literal">groupmod</code>, <code class="literal">groupdel</code>, and so on) do not permit them.
		Also, a number of UNIX systems management tools enforce their own particular interpretation
		of the POSIX standards and likewise do not permit uppercase or space characters in group
		or user account names. You have to experiment with your system to find what its 
		peculiarities are.

		My Windows NT4 PDC has 323,000 user accounts. How long will it take to migrate them to a Samba-3
		LDAP backend system using the vampire process?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		UNIX UIDs and GIDs on most UNIX systems use an unsigned short or an unsigned integer. Recent Linux
		kernels support at least a much larger number. On systems that have a 16-bit constraint on UID/GIDs,
		you would not be able to migrate 323,000 accounts because this number cannot fit into a 16-bit unsigned
		integer. UNIX/Linux systems that have a 32-bit UID/GID can easily handle this number of accounts. 
		Please check this carefully before you attempt to effect a migration using the vampire process.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2598941"></a>
		Migration speed depends much on the processor speed, the network speed, disk I/O capability, and
		LDAP update overheads. On a dual processor AMD MP1600+ with 1 GB memory that was mirroring LDAP
		to a second identical system over 1 Gb Ethernet, I was able to migrate around 180 user accounts
		per minute. Migration would obviously go much faster if LDAP mirroring were turned off during the migration.
