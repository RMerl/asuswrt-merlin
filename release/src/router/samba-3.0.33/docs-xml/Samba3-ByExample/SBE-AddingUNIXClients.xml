	The most frequently discussed Samba subjects over the past 2 years have focused around domain control and printing. 
	It is well known that Samba is a file and print server. A recent survey conducted by <emphasis>Open Magazine</emphasis> found 
	that of all respondents, 97 percent use Samba for file and print services, and 68 percent use Samba for Domain Control. See the 
	<ulink url="http://www.open-mag.com/cgi-bin/opencgi/surveys/survey.cgi?survey_name=samba">Open-Mag</ulink>
	Web site for current information. The survey results as found on January 14, 2004, are shown in

	While domain control is an exciting subject, basic file and print sharing remains the staple bread-and-butter
	function that Samba provides. Yet this book may give the appearance of having focused too much on more
	exciting aspects of Samba deployment. This chapter directs your attention to provide important information on
	the addition of Samba servers into your present Windows network &smbmdash; whatever the controlling technology
	may be. So let's get back to our good friends at Abmas.

	Looking back over the achievements of the past year or two, daily events at Abmas are rather straightforward
	with not too many distractions or problems. Your team is doing well, but a number of employees
	are asking for Linux desktop systems. Your network has grown and demands additional domain member servers. Let's
	get on with this; Christine and Stan are ready to go.

	Stan is firmly in control of the department of the future, while Christine is enjoying a stable and
	predictable network environment. It is time to add more servers and to add Linux desktops. It is
	time to meet the demands of future growth and endure trial by fire.

	<para><indexterm>
	    <primary>Active Directory</primary>
	  </indexterm>
	You must now add UNIX/Linux domain member servers to your network. You have a friend who has a Windows 2003
	Active Directory domain network who wants to add a Samba/Linux server and has asked Christine to help him
	out. Your real objective is to help Christine to see more of the way the Microsoft world lives and use
	her help to get validation that Samba really does live up to expectations.
	</para>

	<para>
	Over the past 6 months, you have hired several new staff who want Linux on their desktops. You must integrate
	these systems to make sure that Abmas is not building islands of technology. You ask Christine to
	do likewise at Swodniw Biz NL (your friend's company) to help them to evaluate a Linux desktop. You want to make
	the right decision, don't you?

	Recent Samba mailing-list activity is witness to how many sites are using winbind. Some have no trouble
	at all with it, yet to others the problems seem insurmountable. Periodically there are complaints concerning
	an inability to achieve identical user and group IDs between Windows and UNIX environments.

		<para>
		One of the great challenges we face when people ask us, <quote>What is the best way to solve

		There are a few facts we should note when dealing with the question of how best to

			A domain member can be authoritative for local accounts, but is never authoritative for

		For many administrators, it should be plain that the use of an LDAP-based repository for all network

		If your network account information resides in an LDAP repository, you should use it ahead of any
		alternative method. This means that if it is humanly possible to use the <command>nss_ldap</command>
		tools to resolve UNIX account UIDs/GIDs via LDAP, this is the preferred solution, because it provides
		a more readily controllable method for asserting the exact same user and group identifiers

		In the situation where UNIX accounts are held on the domain member server itself, the only effective
		way to use them involves the &smb.conf; entry 
		<smbconfoption name="winbind trusted domains only">Yes</smbconfoption>. This forces 
		Samba (<command>smbd</command>) to perform a <command>getpwnam()</command> system call that can
		then be controlled via <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> file settings. The use of this parameter
		disables the use of Samba with trusted domains (i.e., external domains).

		Winbind can be used to create an appliance mode domain member server. In this capacity, <command>winbindd</command>
		is configured to automatically allocate UIDs/GIDs from numeric ranges set in the &smb.conf; file. The allocation
		is made for all accounts that connect to that domain member server, whether within its own domain or from
		trusted domains. If not stored in an LDAP backend, each domain member maintains its own unique mapping database.
		This means that it is almost certain that a given user who accesses two domain member servers does not have the
		same UID/GID on both servers &smbmdash; however, this is transparent to the Windows network user. This data
		is stored in the <filename>winbindd_idmap.tdb</filename> and <filename>winbindd_cache.tdb</filename> files.
		</para>
	
		<para>
		<indexterm><primary>mapping</primary></indexterm>
		The use of an LDAP backend for the Winbind IDMAP facility permits Windows domain SIDs
		mappings to UIDs/GIDs to be stored centrally. The result is a consistent mapping across all domain member
		servers so configured. This solves one of the major headaches for network administrators who need to copy
		files between or across network file servers.

		One of the most fierce conflicts recently being waged is resistance to the adoption of LDAP, in
		particular OpenLDAP, as a replacement for UNIX NIS (previously called Yellow Pages). Let's face it, LDAP
		is different and requires a new approach to the need for a better identity management solution. The more
		you work with LDAP, the more its power and flexibility emerges from its dark, cavernous chasm.
		</para>

		<para>
		LDAP is a most suitable solution for heterogenous environments. If you need crypto, add Kerberos. 
		The reason these are preferable is because they are heterogenous. Windows solutions of this sort are <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
		heterogenous by design. This is fundamental &smbmdash; it isn't religious or political. This also doesn't say that 
		you can't use Windows Active Directory in a heterogenous environment &smbmdash; it can be done, it just requires 
		commercial integration products. But it's not what Active Directory was designed for.

		A number of long-term UNIX devotees have recently commented in various communications that the Samba Team
		is the first application group to almost force network administrators to use LDAP. It should be pointed
		out that we resisted this for as long as we could. It is not out of laziness or malice that LDAP has
		finally emerged as the preferred identity management backend for Samba. We recommend LDAP for your total
		organizational directory needs.

	<indexterm><primary>Domain Controller</primary></indexterm>
	The domain member server and the domain member client are at the center of focus in this chapter.
	Configuration of Samba-3 domain controller is covered in earlier chapters, so if your 
	interest is in domain controller configuration, you will not find that here. You will find good
	oil that helps you to add domain member servers and clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>Domain Member</primary><secondary>workstations</secondary></indexterm>
	In practice, domain member servers and domain member workstations are very different entities, but in
	terms of technology they share similar core infrastructure. A technologist would argue that servers
	and workstations are identical. Many users would argue otherwise, given that in a well-disciplined
	environment a workstation (client) is a device from which a user creates documents and files that
	are located on servers. A workstation is frequently viewed as a disposable (easy to replace) item,
	but a server is viewed as a core component of the business.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>workstation</primary></indexterm>
	We can look at this another way. If a workstation breaks down, one user is affected, but if a
	server breaks down, hundreds of users may not be able to work. The services that a workstation
	must provide are document- and file-production oriented; a server provides information storage
	and is distribution oriented.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>authentication process</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>logon process</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>user identities</primary></indexterm>
	<emphasis>Why is this important?</emphasis> For starters, we must identify what
	components of the operating system and its environment must be configured. Also, it is necessary
	to recognize where the interdependencies between the various services to be used are.
	In particular, it is important to understand the operation of each critical part of the
	authentication process, the logon process, and how user identities get resolved and applied
	within the operating system and applications (like Samba) that depend on this and may
	actually contribute to it.
	</para>

	<para>
	So, in this chapter we demonstrate how to implement the technology. It is done within a context of
	what type of service need must be fulfilled.

	In this example, it is assumed that you have Samba PDC/BDC servers. This means you are using
	an LDAP ldapsam backend. We are adding to the LDAP backend database (directory)
	containers for use by the IDMAP facility. This makes it possible to have globally consistent
	mapping of SIDs to and from UIDs and GIDs. This means that it is necessary to run 
	<command>winbindd</command> as part of your configuration. The primary purpose of running
	<command>winbindd</command> (within this operational context) is to permit mapping of foreign
	SIDs (those not originating from the the local Samba server). Foreign SIDs can come from any
	domain member client or server, or from Windows clients that do not belong to a domain. Another
	way to explain the necessity to run <command>winbindd</command> is that Samba can locally
	resolve only accounts that belong to the security context of its own machine SID. Winbind
	handles all non-local SIDs and maps them to a local UID/GID value. The UID and GID are allocated
	from the parameter values set in the &smb.conf; file for the <parameter>idmap uid</parameter> and
	<parameter>idmap gid</parameter> ranges. Where LDAP is used, the mappings can be stored in LDAP
	so that all domain member servers can use a consistent mapping.

	If your installation is accessed only from clients that are members of your own domain, and all

	</para>

	<para>
	It is possible to use a local passdb backend with any convenient means of resolving the POSIX

	In this example configuration, Samba will directly search the LDAP-based passwd backend ldapsam

		When using winbind, it is in fact undesirable to do this because it results in

		The LDAP directory must have a container object for IDMAP data. There are several ways you can

ou: idmap
</screen>
		<indexterm><primary>ldapadd</primary></indexterm>

		Samba automatically populates the LDAP directory container when it needs to. To permit Samba
		write access to the LDAP directory it is necessary to set the LDAP administrative password
		in the <filename>secrets.tdb</filename> file as shown here:
<screen>
&rootprompt; smbpasswd -w not24get

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>net</primary><secondary>rpc</secondary><tertiary>join</tertiary></indexterm>

		The system is ready to join the domain. Execute the following:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net rpc join -U root%not24get
Joined domain MEGANET2.
</screen>
		This indicates that the domain join succeeded.
		</para>

		<para>
		Failure to join the domain could be caused by any number of variables. The most common
		causes of failure to join are:
		</para>

		<para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>Broken resolution of NetBIOS names to the respective IP address.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Incorrect username and password credentials.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>The NT4 <parameter>restrict anonymous</parameter> is set to exclude anonymous
				connections.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist> 
		</para>

		<para>
		The connection setup can be diagnosed by executing:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net rpc join -S 'pdc-name' -U administrator%password -d 5
</screen>
		<indexterm><primary>failed</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>failed join</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>rejected</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>restrict anonymous</primary></indexterm>
		Note: Use "root" for UNIX/Linux and Samba, use "Administrator" for Windows NT4/200X. If the cause of
		the failure appears to be related to a rejected or failed NT_SESSION_SETUP*  or an error message that
		says NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED immediately check the Windows registry setting that controls the
		<constant>restrict anonymous</constant> setting. Set this to the value 0 so that an anonymous connection
		can be sustained, then try again.
		</para>

		<para>
		It is possible (perhaps even recommended) to use the following to validate the ability to connect
		to an NT4 PDC/BDC:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net rpc info -S 'pdc-name' -U Administrator%not24get
Domain Name: MEGANET2
Domain SID: S-1-5-21-422319763-4138913805-7168186429
Sequence number: 1519909596
Num users: 7003
Num domain groups: 821
Num local groups: 8

&rootprompt; net rpc testjoin -S 'pdc-name' -U Administrator%not24get
Join to 'MEGANET2' is OK
</screen>
		If for any reason the following response is obtained to the last command above,it is time to
		call in the Networking Super-Snooper task force (i.e., start debugging):
<screen>
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
Join to 'MEGANET2' failed.
</screen>
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>wbinfo</primary></indexterm>
		Just joining the domain is not quite enough; you must now provide a privileged set
		of credentials through which <command>winbindd</command> can interact with the 
		domain servers. Execute the following to implant the necessary credentials:
<screen>
&rootprompt; wbinfo --set-auth-user=Administrator%not24get
</screen>
		The configuration is now ready to obtain the Samba domain user and group information.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		You may now start Samba in the usual manner, and your Samba domain member server
		is ready for use. Just add shares as required.

	Later in the chapter, you can see how to configure a Samba domain member server for a Windows ADS domain.
	Right now your objective is to configure a Samba server that can be a member of a Windows NT4-style
	domain and/or does not use LDAP.
	</para>

	<note><para>
	<indexterm><primary>duplicate accounts</primary></indexterm>
	If you use <command>winbind</command> for identity resolution, make sure that there are no
	duplicate accounts.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>/etc/passwd</primary></indexterm>
	For example, do not have more than one account that has UID=0 in the password database. If there 
	is an account called <constant>root</constant> in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> database, 
	it is okay to have an account called <constant>root</constant> in the LDAP ldapsam or in the 
	tdbsam. But if there are two accounts in the passdb backend that have the same UID, winbind will 
	break. This means that the <constant>Administrator</constant> account must be called 
	<constant>root</constant>.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>/etc/passwd</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>ldapsam</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>tdbsam</primary></indexterm>
	Winbind will break if there is an account in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> that has 
	the same UID as an account that is in LDAP ldapsam (or in tdbsam) but that differs in name only.

	The following configuration uses CIFS/SMB protocols alone to obtain user and group credentials.
	The winbind information is locally cached in the <filename>winbindd_cache.tdb winbindd_idmap.tdb</filename>
	files. This provides considerable performance benefits compared with the LDAP solution, particularly
	where the LDAP lookups must traverse WAN links. You may examine the contents of these
	files using the tool <command>tdbdump</command>, though you may have to build this from the Samba
	source code if it has not been supplied as part of a binary package distribution that you may be using.

	One of the much-sought-after features new to Samba-3 is the ability to join an Active Directory
	domain using Kerberos protocols. This makes it possible to operate an entire Windows network
	without the need to run NetBIOS over TCP/IP and permits more secure networking in general. An
	exhaustively complete discussion of the protocols is not possible in this book; perhaps a
	later book may explore the intricacies of the NetBIOS-less operation that Samba-3 can participate
	in. For now, we simply focus on how a Samba-3 server can be made a domain member server.
	</para>

	<indexterm><primary>LDAP</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>Identity resolution</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>Kerberos</primary></indexterm>
	The diagram in <link linkend="ch9-adsdc"/> demonstrates how Samba-3 interfaces with
	Microsoft Active Directory components. It should be noted that if Microsoft Windows Services
	for UNIX (SFU) has been installed and correctly configured, it is possible to use client LDAP
	for identity resolution just as can be done with Samba-3 when using an LDAP passdb backend.
	The UNIX tool that you need for this, as in the case of LDAP on UNIX/Linux, is the PADL
	Software nss_ldap tool-set. Compared with use of winbind and Kerberos, the use of 
	LDAP-based identity resolution is a little less secure. In view of the fact that this solution
	requires additional software to be installed on the Windows 200x ADS domain controllers,
	and that means more management overhead, it is likely that most Samba-3 ADS client sites
	may elect to use winbind.
	</para>

	<para>
	Do not attempt to use this procedure if you are not 100 percent certain that the build of Samba-3
	you are using has been compiled and linked with all the tools necessary for this to work.
	Given the importance of this step, you must first validate that the Samba-3 message block
	daemon (<command>smbd</command>) has the necessary features.
	</para>

	<para>
	The hypothetical domain you are using in this example assumes that the Abmas London office
	decided to take its own lead (some would say this is a typical behavior in a global
	corporate world; besides, a little divergence and conflict makes for an interesting life).
	The Windows Server 2003 ADS domain is called <constant>london.abmas.biz</constant> and the
	name of the server is <constant>W2K3S</constant>. In ADS realm terms, the domain controller
	is known as <constant>w2k3s.london.abmas.biz</constant>. In NetBIOS nomenclature, the
	domain name is <constant>LONDON</constant> and the server name is <constant>W2K3S</constant>.

	<title>Joining a Samba Server as an ADS Domain Member</title>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>smbd</primary></indexterm>
		Before you try to use Samba-3, you want to know for certain that your executables have
		support for Kerberos and for LDAP. Execute the following to identify whether or
		not this build is perhaps suitable for use:
<screen>
&rootprompt; cd /usr/sbin
&rootprompt; smbd -b | grep KRB
   HAVE_KRB5_H
   HAVE_ADDR_TYPE_IN_KRB5_ADDRESS
   HAVE_KRB5
   HAVE_KRB5_AUTH_CON_SETKEY
   HAVE_KRB5_GET_DEFAULT_IN_TKT_ETYPES
   HAVE_KRB5_GET_PW_SALT
   HAVE_KRB5_KEYBLOCK_KEYVALUE
   HAVE_KRB5_KEYTAB_ENTRY_KEYBLOCK
   HAVE_KRB5_MK_REQ_EXTENDED
   HAVE_KRB5_PRINCIPAL_GET_COMP_STRING
   HAVE_KRB5_SET_DEFAULT_IN_TKT_ETYPES
   HAVE_KRB5_STRING_TO_KEY
   HAVE_KRB5_STRING_TO_KEY_SALT
   HAVE_LIBKRB5
</screen>
		This output was obtained on a SUSE Linux system and shows the output for
		Samba that has been compiled and linked with the Heimdal Kerberos libraries.
		The following is a typical output that will be found on a Red Hat Linux system that
		has been linked with the MIT Kerberos libraries:
<screen>
&rootprompt; cd /usr/sbin
&rootprompt; smbd -b | grep KRB
   HAVE_KRB5_H
   HAVE_ADDRTYPE_IN_KRB5_ADDRESS
   HAVE_KRB5
   HAVE_KRB5_AUTH_CON_SETUSERUSERKEY
   HAVE_KRB5_ENCRYPT_DATA
   HAVE_KRB5_FREE_DATA_CONTENTS
   HAVE_KRB5_FREE_KTYPES
   HAVE_KRB5_GET_PERMITTED_ENCTYPES
   HAVE_KRB5_KEYTAB_ENTRY_KEY
   HAVE_KRB5_LOCATE_KDC
   HAVE_KRB5_MK_REQ_EXTENDED
   HAVE_KRB5_PRINCIPAL2SALT
   HAVE_KRB5_PRINC_COMPONENT
   HAVE_KRB5_SET_DEFAULT_TGS_KTYPES
   HAVE_KRB5_SET_REAL_TIME
   HAVE_KRB5_STRING_TO_KEY
   HAVE_KRB5_TKT_ENC_PART2
   HAVE_KRB5_USE_ENCTYPE
   HAVE_LIBGSSAPI_KRB5
   HAVE_LIBKRB5
</screen>
		You can validate that Samba has been compiled and linked with LDAP support
		by executing:
<screen>
&rootprompt; smbd -b | grep LDAP
massive:/usr/sbin # smbd -b | grep LDAP
   HAVE_LDAP_H
   HAVE_LDAP
   HAVE_LDAP_DOMAIN2HOSTLIST
   HAVE_LDAP_INIT
   HAVE_LDAP_INITIALIZE
   HAVE_LDAP_SET_REBIND_PROC
   HAVE_LIBLDAP
   LDAP_SET_REBIND_PROC_ARGS
</screen>
		This does look promising; <command>smbd</command> has been built with Kerberos and LDAP
		support. You are relieved to know that it is safe to progress.
		</para></step>

		<indexterm><primary>validated</primary></indexterm>
		The next step is to identify which version of the Kerberos libraries have been used.
		In order to permit Samba-3 to interoperate with Windows 2003 Active Directory, it is
		essential that it has been linked with either MIT Kerberos version 1.3.1 or later,
		or that it has been linked with Heimdal Kerberos 0.6 plus specific patches. You may
		identify what version of the MIT Kerberos libraries are installed on your system by
		executing (on Red Hat Linux):
<screen>
&rootprompt; rpm -q krb5
</screen>
		Or on SUSE Linux, execute:
<screen>
&rootprompt; rpm -q heimdal
</screen>
		Please note that the RPMs provided by the Samba-Team are known to be working and have
		been validated. Red Hat Linux RPMs may be obtained from the Samba FTP sites. SUSE
		Linux RPMs may be obtained from <ulink url="ftp://ftp.sernet.de">Sernet</ulink> in
		Germany.
		</para>

		<para>
		From this point on, you are certain that the Samba-3 build you are using has the
		necessary capabilities. You can now configure Samba-3 and the NSS. 
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Using you favorite editor, configure the &smb.conf; file that is located in the 
		<filename>/etc/samba</filename> directory so that it has the contents shown 
		in <link linkend="ch9-adssdm"/>.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Edit or create the NSS control file so it has the contents shown in <link linkend="ch9-sdmnss"/>.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>/etc/samba/secrets.tdb</primary></indexterm>
		Delete the file <filename>/etc/samba/secrets.tdb</filename> if it exists. Of course, you
		do keep a backup, don't you?
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		Delete the tdb files that cache Samba information. You keep a backup of the old
		files, of course. You also remove all files to ensure that nothing can pollute your
		nice, new configuration. Execute the following (example is for SUSE Linux):
<screen>
&rootprompt; rm /var/lib/samba/*tdb
</screen>
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>testparm</primary></indexterm>
		Validate your &smb.conf; file using <command>testparm</command> (as you have
		done previously). Correct all errors reported before proceeding. The command you
		execute is:
<screen>
&rootprompt; testparm -s | less
</screen>
		Now that you are satisfied that your Samba server is ready to join the Windows
		ADS domain, let's move on.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>net</primary><secondary>ads</secondary><tertiary>join</tertiary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>Kerberos</primary></indexterm>
		This is a good time to double-check everything and then execute the following
		command when everything you have done has checked out okay:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net ads join -UAdministrator%not24get
Using short domain name -- LONDON
Joined 'FRAN' to realm 'LONDON.ABMAS.BIZ'
</screen>
		You have successfully made your Samba-3 server a member of the ADS domain
		using Kerberos protocols.
		</para>

	    <para>
		<indexterm><primary>silent return</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>failed join</primary></indexterm>
		In the event that you receive no output messages, a silent return means that the
		domain join failed. You should use <command>ethereal</command> to identify what
		may be failing. Common causes of a failed join include:

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			<indexterm><primary>name resolution</primary><secondary>Defective</secondary></indexterm>
			Defective or misconfigured DNS name resolution.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			<indexterm><primary>Restrictive security</primary></indexterm>
			Restrictive security settings on the Windows 200x ADS domain controller
			preventing needed communications protocols. You can check this by searching
			the Windows Server 200x Event Viewer.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			Incorrectly configured &smb.conf; file settings.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			Lack of support of necessary Kerberos protocols because the version of MIT
			Kerberos (or Heimdal) in use is not up to date enough to support the necessary
			functionality.

		<indexterm><primary>net</primary><secondary>rpc</secondary><tertiary>join</tertiary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>RPC</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>mixed mode</primary></indexterm>
		In any case, never execute the <command>net rpc join</command> command in an attempt
		to join the Samba server to the domain, unless you wish not to use the Kerberos
		security protocols. Use of the older RPC-based domain join facility requires that
		Windows Server 200x ADS has been configured appropriately for mixed mode operation.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>tdbdump</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>/etc/samba/secrets.tdb</primary></indexterm>
		If the <command>tdbdump</command> is installed on your system (not essential),
		you can look inside the <filename>/etc/samba/secrets.tdb</filename> file. If
		you wish to do this, execute:
<screen>
&rootprompt; tdbdump secrets.tdb
{
key = "SECRETS/SID/LONDON"
data = "\01\04\00\00\00\00\00\05\15\00\00\00\EBw\86\F1\ED\BD\
   F6{\5C6\E5W\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\

   00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00"
}
{
key = "SECRETS/MACHINE_PASSWORD/LONDON"
data = "le3Q5FPnN5.ueC\00"
}
{
key = "SECRETS/MACHINE_SEC_CHANNEL_TYPE/LONDON"
data = "\02\00\00\00"
}
{
key = "SECRETS/MACHINE_LAST_CHANGE_TIME/LONDON"
data = "E\89\F6?"
}
</screen>
		This is given to demonstrate to the skeptics that this process truly does work.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		It is now time to start Samba in the usual way (as has been done many time before
		in this book).	
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>wbinfo</primary></indexterm>
		This is a good time to verify that everything is working. First, check that
		winbind is able to obtain the list of users and groups from the ADS domain controller.
		Execute the following:
<screen>
&rootprompt; wbinfo -u
LONDON+Administrator
LONDON+Guest
LONDON+SUPPORT_388945a0
LONDON+krbtgt
LONDON+jht
</screen>
		Good, the list of users was obtained. Now do likewise for group accounts:
<screen>
&rootprompt; wbinfo -g
LONDON+Domain Computers
LONDON+Domain Controllers
LONDON+Schema Admins
LONDON+Enterprise Admins
LONDON+Domain Admins
LONDON+Domain Users
LONDON+Domain Guests
LONDON+Group Policy Creator Owners
LONDON+DnsUpdateProxy
</screen>
		Excellent. That worked also, as expected.
		</para></step>

	  <step><para><indexterm>
		<primary>getent</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		Now repeat this via NSS to validate that full identity resolution is
		functional as required. Execute:
<screen>
&rootprompt; getent passwd
...
LONDON+Administrator:x:10000:10000:Administrator:
             /home/LONDON/administrator:/bin/bash
LONDON+Guest:x:10001:10001:Guest:
             /home/LONDON/guest:/bin/bash
LONDON+SUPPORT_388945a0:x:10002:10000:SUPPORT_388945a0:
             /home/LONDON/support_388945a0:/bin/bash
LONDON+krbtgt:x:10003:10000:krbtgt:
             /home/LONDON/krbtgt:/bin/bash
LONDON+jht:x:10004:10000:John H. Terpstra:
             /home/LONDON/jht:/bin/bash
</screen>
		Okay, ADS user accounts are being resolved. Now you try group resolution:
<screen>
&rootprompt; getent group
...
LONDON+Domain Computers:x:10002:
LONDON+Domain Controllers:x:10003:
LONDON+Schema Admins:x:10004:LONDON+Administrator
LONDON+Enterprise Admins:x:10005:LONDON+Administrator
LONDON+Domain Admins:x:10006:LONDON+jht,LONDON+Administrator
LONDON+Domain Users:x:10000:
LONDON+Domain Guests:x:10001:
LONDON+Group Policy Creator Owners:x:10007:LONDON+Administrator
LONDON+DnsUpdateProxy:x:10008:
</screen>
		This is very pleasing. Everything works as expected.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>net</primary><secondary>ads</secondary><tertiary>info</tertiary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>Active Directory</primary><secondary>server</secondary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>Kerberos</primary></indexterm>
		You may now perform final verification that communications between Samba-3 winbind and
		the Active Directory server is using Kerberos protocols. Execute the following:
<screen>
&rootprompt; net ads info
LDAP server: 192.168.2.123
LDAP server name: w2k3s
Realm: LONDON.ABMAS.BIZ
Bind Path: dc=LONDON,dc=ABMAS,dc=BIZ
LDAP port: 389
Server time: Sat, 03 Jan 2004 02:44:44 GMT
KDC server: 192.168.2.123
Server time offset: 2
</screen>
		It should be noted that Kerberos protocols are time-clock critical. You should
		keep all server time clocks synchronized using the network time protocol (NTP).
		In any case, the output we obtained confirms that all systems are operational.
		</para></step>

		<step><para>
		<indexterm><primary>net</primary><secondary>ads</secondary><tertiary>status</tertiary></indexterm>
		There is one more action you elect to take, just because you are paranoid and disbelieving,
		so you execute the following command:

        The <command>idmap_rid</command> facility is a new tool that, unlike native winbind, creates a
        predictable mapping of MS Windows SIDs to UNIX UIDs and GIDs. The key benefit of this method
        of implementing the Samba IDMAP facility is that it eliminates the need to store the IDMAP data
        in a central place. The downside is that it can be used only within a single ADS domain and
        is not compatible with trusted domain implementations.

        <indexterm><primary>idmap gid</primary></indexterm>
        This alternate method of SID to UID/GID  mapping can be achieved with the idmap_rid
        plug-in. This plug-in uses the RID of the user SID to derive the UID and GID by adding the
        RID to a base value specified. This utility requires that the parameter
        <quote>allow trusted domains = No</quote> must be specified, as it is not compatible
        with multiple domain environments. The <parameter>idmap uid</parameter> and
        <parameter>idmap gid</parameter> ranges must be specified.

        The idmap_rid facility can be used both for NT4/Samba-style domains as well as with Active Directory.
        To use this with an NT4 domain, the <parameter>realm</parameter> is not used. Additionally the
        method used to join the domain uses the <constant>net rpc join</constant> process.

        In a large domain with many users, it is imperative to disable enumeration of users and groups.
        For example, at a site that has 22,000 users in Active Directory the winbind-based user and
        group resolution is unavailable for nearly 12 minutes following first start-up of
        <command>winbind</command>. Disabling of such enumeration results in instantaneous response.
        The disabling of user and group enumeration means that it will not be possible to list users
        or groups using the <command>getent passwd</command> and <command>getent group</command>
        commands. It will be possible to perform the lookup for individual users, as shown in the procedure

        The storage of IDMAP information in LDAP can be used with both NT4/Samba-3-style domains as well as
        with ADS domains. OpenLDAP is a commonly used LDAP server for this purpose, although any standards-compliant
        LDAP server can be used. It is therefore possible to deploy this IDMAP configuration using
        the Sun iPlanet LDAP server, Novell eDirectory, Microsoft ADS plus ADAM, and so on.

	<para>
	The following guidelines are pertinent to the deployment of winbind-based authentication
	and identity resolution with the express purpose of allowing users to log on to UNIX/Linux desktops
	using Windows network domain user credentials (username and password).
	</para>

	<para>
	You should note that it is possible to use LDAP-based PAM and NSS tools to permit distributed
	systems logons (SSO), providing user and group accounts are stored in an LDAP directory. This
	provides logon services for UNIX/Linux users, while Windows users obtain their sign-on
	support via Samba-3.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>Windows Services for UNIX</primary><see>SUS</see></indexterm>
	On the other hand, if the authentication and identity resolution backend must be provided by
	a Windows NT4-style domain or from an Active Directory Domain that does not have the Microsoft
	Windows Services for UNIX installed, winbind is your best friend. Specific guidance for these
	situations now follows.

	To permit users to log on to a Linux system using Windows network credentials, you need to
	configure identity resolution (NSS) and PAM. This means that the basic steps include those
	outlined above with the addition of PAM configuration. Given that most workstations (desktop/client)
	usually do not need to provide file and print services to a group of users, the configuration
	of shares and printers is generally less important. Often this allows the share specifications
	to be entirely removed from the &smb.conf; file. That is obviously an administrator decision.

		<indexterm><primary>Winbind</primary></indexterm>
		You can use NIS for your UNIX accounts. NIS does not store the Windows encrypted
		passwords that need to be stored in one of the acceptable passdb backends.
		Your choice of backend is limited to <parameter>smbpasswd</parameter> or
		<parameter>tdbsam</parameter>. Winbind is needed to handle the resolution of
		SIDs from trusted domains to local UID/GID values.
		</para>

	    <para>
		<indexterm><primary>winbind trusted domains only</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>getpwnam()</primary></indexterm>
		On a domain member server, you effectively map Windows domain users to local users
		that are in your NIS database by specifying the <parameter>winbind trusted domains
		only</parameter>. This causes user and group account lookups to be routed via
		the <command>getpwnam()</command> family of systems calls. On an NIS-enabled client,
		this pushes the resolution of users and groups out through NIS.
		</para>

		<para>
		As a general rule, it is always a good idea to run winbind on all Samba servers.

		<primary>schema</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		Microsoft Active Directory is an LDAP server that is intricately tied to a Kerberos
		infrastructure. Most IT managers who object to LDAP do so because
		an LDAP server is most often supplied as a raw tool that needs to be configured and
		for which the administrator must create the schema, create the administration tools, and
		devise the backup and recovery facilities in a site-dependent manner. LDAP servers
		in general are seen as a high-energy, high-risk facility.
		</para>

	    <para><indexterm>
		<primary>management</primary>
	      </indexterm>
		Microsoft Active Directory by comparison is easy to install and configure and
		is supplied with all tools necessary to implement and manage the directory. For sites
		that lack a lot of technical competence, Active Directory is a good choice. For sites
		that have the technical competence to handle Active Directory well, LDAP is a good
		alternative. The real issue is, What type of solution does
		the site want? If management wants a choice to use an alternative, they may want to
		consider the options. On the other hand, if management just wants a solution that works,
		Microsoft Active Directory is a good solution.

		Many UNIX administrators mock the model that the personal computer industry has adopted

		UNIX administrators are fully correct in asserting that UNIX servers and workstations
		are identical in terms of the software that is installed. They correctly assert that

		from the ID that the user/group has on domain controllers. The winbind allocated UID/GID
		that is stored in LDAP (or locally) will be in the numeric range specified in the <parameter>
		idmap uid/gid</parameter> in the &smb.conf; file. On domain controllers, the UID/GID is

		Samba depends on correctly functioning resolution of hostnames to their IP address. Samba
		makes no direct DNS lookup calls, but rather redirects all name-to-address calls via the
		<command>getXXXbyXXX()</command> function calls. The configuration of the <constant>hosts</constant>
		entry in the NSS <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> file determines how the underlying
		resolution process is implemented. If the <constant>hosts</constant> entry in your NSS
		control file says:
<screen>
hosts: files dns wins
</screen>
		this means that a hostname lookup first tries the <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>.
		If this fails to resolve, it attempts a DNS lookup, and if that fails, it tries a
		WINS lookup.

		The addition of the WINS-based name lookup makes sense only if NetBIOS over TCP/IP has
		been enabled on all Windows clients. Where NetBIOS over TCP/IP has been disabled, DNS
		is the preferred name resolution technology. This usually makes most sense when Samba
		is a client of an Active Directory domain, where NetBIOS use has been disabled. In this
		case, the Windows 200x autoregisters all locator records it needs with its own DNS
		server or servers.

		When I tried to execute net ads join, I got no output. It did not work, so
		I think that it failed. I then executed net rpc join and that worked fine.
		That is okay, isn't it?

		a Windows NT4 client, and Samba-3 will not be using Kerberos-based authentication.
