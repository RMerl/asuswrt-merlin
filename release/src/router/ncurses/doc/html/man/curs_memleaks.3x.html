       These functions are used to simplify  analysis  of  memory
       leaks  in  the  ncurses  library.   They  are normally not
       available; they must be configured  into  the  library  at
       build  time  using  the <STRONG>--disable-leaks</STRONG> option.  That com-
       piles-in code that frees memory that normally would not be
       freed.

       Any  implementation of curses must not free the memory as-
       sociated with a screen, since (even after calling <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>),
       it  must be available for use in the next call to <STRONG>refresh</STRONG>.
       There are also chunks of memory held for performance  rea-
       sons.   That  makes it hard to analyze curses applications
       for memory leaks.  To work around this, one  can  build  a
       debugging version of the ncurses library which frees those
       chunks which it can, and provides these functions to  free
       all of the memory allocated by the ncurses library.

       The  _nc_free_and_exit function is the preferred one since
       some of the memory which is freed may be required for  the
       application  to  continue  running.   Its parameter is the
       code to pass to the exit routine.
