.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_field_opts\fR sets all the given field's option bits (field
option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).
.PP
The function \fBfield_opts_on\fR turns on the given option bits, and leaves

The function \fBfield_opts\fR returns the field's current option bits.
.PP
The following standard options are defined (all are on by default):
.TP 5

not be reachable by navigation keys. Please notice that an invisible field
appears to be inactive also.

Words that do not fit on a line are wrapped to the next line.  Words are
blank-separated.
.PP
One extension option is defined (extensions are off by default):
.TP 5
O_DYNAMIC_JUSTIFY
Permit dynamic fields to be justified, like static fields.

The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
