/* This implementation of sigaction is tailored to native Windows behavior:
   signal() has SysV semantics (ie. the handler is uninstalled before
   it is invoked).  This is an inherent data race if an asynchronous
   signal is sent twice in a row before we can reinstall our handler,
   but there's nothing we can do about it.  Meanwhile, sigprocmask()
   is not present, and while we can use the gnulib replacement to
   provide critical sections, it too suffers from potential data races
   in the face of an ill-timed asynchronous signal.  And we compound
   the situation by reading static storage in a signal handler, which
   POSIX warns is not generically async-signal-safe.  Oh well.

   Additionally:
     - We don't implement SA_NOCLDSTOP or SA_NOCLDWAIT, because SIGCHLD
       is not defined.
     - We don't implement SA_ONSTACK, because sigaltstack() is not present.
     - We ignore SA_RESTART, because blocking native Windows API calls are
       not interrupted anyway when an asynchronous signal occurs, and the
       MSVCRT runtime never sets errno to EINTR.
     - We don't implement SA_SIGINFO because it is impossible to do so
       portably.

   POSIX states that an application should not mix signal() and
   sigaction().  We support the use of signal() within the gnulib
   sigprocmask() substitute, but all other application code linked
   with this module should stick with only sigaction().  */
