/* The size of memory objects is often computed through expressions of
   type size_t. Example:
      void* p = malloc (header_size + n * element_size).
   These computations can lead to overflow.  When this happens, malloc()
   returns a piece of memory that is way too small, and the program then
   crashes while attempting to fill the memory.
   To avoid this, the functions and macros in this file check for overflow.
   The convention is that SIZE_MAX represents overflow.
   malloc (SIZE_MAX) is not guaranteed to fail -- think of a malloc
   implementation that uses mmap --, it's recommended to use size_overflow_p()
   or size_in_bounds_p() before invoking malloc().
   The example thus becomes:
      size_t size = xsum (header_size, xtimes (n, element_size));
      void *p = (size_in_bounds_p (size) ? malloc (size) : NULL);
