  /* Instead of the traditional loop which tests each byte, we will test a
     longword at a time.  The tricky part is testing if *any of the four*
     bytes in the longword in question are equal to c.  We first use an xor
     with repeated_c.  This reduces the task to testing whether *any of the
     four* bytes in longword1 is zero.

     We compute tmp =
       ((longword1 - repeated_one) & ~longword1) & (repeated_one << 7).
     That is, we perform the following operations:
       1. Subtract repeated_one.
       2. & ~longword1.
       3. & a mask consisting of 0x80 in every byte.
     Consider what happens in each byte:
       - If a byte of longword1 is zero, step 1 and 2 transform it into 0xff,
         and step 3 transforms it into 0x80.  A carry can also be propagated
         to more significant bytes.
       - If a byte of longword1 is nonzero, let its lowest 1 bit be at
         position k (0 <= k <= 7); so the lowest k bits are 0.  After step 1,
         the byte ends in a single bit of value 0 and k bits of value 1.
         After step 2, the result is just k bits of value 1: 2^k - 1.  After
         step 3, the result is 0.  And no carry is produced.
     So, if longword1 has only non-zero bytes, tmp is zero.
     Whereas if longword1 has a zero byte, call j the position of the least
     significant zero byte.  Then the result has a zero at positions 0, ...,
     j-1 and a 0x80 at position j.  We cannot predict the result at the more
     significant bytes (positions j+1..3), but it does not matter since we
     already have a non-zero bit at position 8*j+7.

     So, the test whether any byte in longword1 is zero is equivalent to
     testing whether tmp is nonzero.  */

     memory accesses, just by looking at the tmp result from the last loop
     iteration.  But this does not work on big-endian machines.  Choose code
     that works in both cases.  */
