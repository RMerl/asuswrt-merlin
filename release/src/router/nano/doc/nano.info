1 Introduction
**************

GNU 'nano' is a small and friendly text editor.  Besides basic text
editing, 'nano' offers many extra features, such as an interactive
search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling,
auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file
locking, backup files, and internationalization support.

   The original goal for 'nano' was to be a complete bug-for-bug
emulation of Pico.  But currently the goal is to be as compatible as
possible while offering a superset of Pico's functionality.  See *Note
Pico Compatibility::, for more info.

   Please report bugs via <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano>.

2 Invoking
**********

The usual way to invoke 'nano' is:

     'nano [FILE]'

   But it is also possible to specify one or more options (see the next
section), and to edit several files in a row.  Additionally, the cursor
can be put on a specific line of a file by adding the line number with a
plus sign before the filename, and even in a specific column by adding
it with a comma.  So a more complete command synopsis is:

     'nano [OPTION]... [[+LINE[,COLUMN]|+,COLUMN] FILE]...'

   Normally, however, you set your preferred options in a '.nanorc' file
(see *Note Nanorc Files::).  And when using 'set positionlog' (making
'nano' remember the cursor position when you close a file), you will
rarely need to specify a line number.

   As a special case: when the first file specified is a dash, 'nano'
will read data from standard input.  Which means you can pipe the output
of a command straight into a buffer.


File: nano.info,  Node: Command-line Options,  Next: Editor Basics,  Prev: Invoking,  Up: Top

3 Command-line Options
**********************

'nano' takes the following options from the command line:

'-A'
'--smarthome'
     Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at
     the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the
     cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).
     If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
     beginning of the line.

'-B'
'--backup'
     When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the
     current filename suffixed with a tilde ('~').

'-C DIRECTORY'
'--backupdir=DIRECTORY'
     Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a
     uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved -- when backups
     are enabled.  The uniquely numbered files are stored in the
     specified directory.

'-D'
'--boldtext'
     Use bold text instead of reverse video text.

'-E'
'--tabstospaces'
     Convert typed tabs to spaces.

'-F'
'--multibuffer'
     Read a file into a new buffer by default.

'-G'
'--locking'
     Enable vim-style file locking when editing files.

'-H'
'--historylog'
     Log search and replace strings to '~/.nano/search_history', so they
     can be retrieved in later sessions.

'-I'
'--ignorercfiles'
     Don't look at the system's nanorc file nor at the user's
     '~/.nanorc'.

'-K'
'--rebindkeypad'
     Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.
     You should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse
     support won't work properly with this option enabled.

'-L'
'--nonewlines'
     Don't add newlines to the ends of files.

'-N'
'--noconvert'
     Disable automatic conversion of files from DOS/Mac format.

'-O'
'--morespace'
     Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.

'-P'
'--positionlog'
     For the 200 most recent files, log the last position of the cursor,
     and place it at that position again upon reopening such a file.
     (The old form of this option, '--poslog', is deprecated.)

'-Q "CHARACTERS"'
'--quotestr="CHARACTERS"'
     Set the quoting string for justifying.  The default value is "^([
     \t]*[|>:}#])+" if extended regular expression support is available,
     and "> " otherwise.  Note that '\t' stands for a literal Tab
     character.

'-R'
'--restricted'
     Restricted mode: don't read or write to any file not specified on
     the command line; don't read any nanorc files nor history files;
     don't allow suspending nor spell checking; don't allow a file to be
     appended to, prepended to, or saved under a different name if it
     already has one; and don't use backup files.  This restricted mode
     is also accessible by invoking 'nano' with any name beginning with
     'r' (e.g. 'rnano').

'-S'
'--smooth'
     Enable smooth scrolling.  Text will scroll line-by-line, instead of
     the usual chunk-by-chunk behavior.

'-T NUMBER'
'--tabsize=NUMBER'
     Set the displayed tab length to NUMBER columns.  The value of
     NUMBER must be greater than 0.  The default value is 8.

'-U'
'--quickblank'
     Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear
     after 1 keystroke instead of 25.  Note that option '-c'
     ('--constantshow') overrides this.

'-V'
'--version'
     Show the current version number and exit.

'-W'
'--wordbounds'
     Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
     characters as parts of words.

'-X "CHARACTERS"'
'--wordchars="CHARACTERS"'
     Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric
     ones) should be considered as parts of words.  This overrides
     option '-W' ('--wordbounds').

'-Y NAME'
'--syntax=NAME'
     Specify a specific syntax from the nanorc files to use for
     highlighting.  See *Note Syntax Highlighting::, for more info.

'-c'
'--constantshow'
     Constantly display the cursor position and line number on the
     statusbar.  Note that this overrides option '-U' ('--quickblank').

'-d'
'--rebinddelete'
     Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and
     Delete work properly.  You should only need to use this option if
     Backspace acts like Delete on your system.

'-g'
'--showcursor'
     Make the cursor visible in the file browser, putting it on the
     highlighted item.  Useful for braille users.

'-h'
'--help'
     Show a summary of command-line options and exit.

'-i'
'--autoindent'
     Automatically indent new lines to the same number of spaces and
     tabs as the previous line.

'-k'
'--cut'
     Make the 'Cut Text' command (normally ^K) cut from the current
     cursor position to the end of the line, instead of cutting the
     entire line.

'-l'
'--linenumbers'
     Display line numbers to the left of the text area.

'-m'
'--mouse'
     Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
     mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
     double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
     Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.  Text can
     still be selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.

'-n'
'--noread'
     Treat any name given on the command line as a new file.  This
     allows 'nano' to write to named pipes: it will start with a blank
     buffer, and will write to the pipe when the user saves the "file".
     This way 'nano' can be used as an editor in combination with for
     instance 'gpg' without having to write sensitive data to disk
     first.

'-o DIRECTORY'
'--operatingdir=DIRECTORY'
     Set the operating directory.  This makes 'nano' set up something
     similar to a chroot.

'-p'
'--preserve'
     Preserve the ^Q (XON) and ^S (XOFF) sequences so data being sent to
     the editor can be stopped and started.

'-q'
'--quiet'
     Do not report errors in the nanorc file nor ask them to be
     acknowledged by pressing Enter at startup.

'-r NUMBER'
'--fill=NUMBER'
     Hard-wrap lines at column NUMBER (by inserting a newline
     character).  If the given value is 0 or less, wrapping will occur
     at the width of the screen minus the given amount, allowing the
     wrapping width to vary along with the width of the screen if and
     when it is resized.  The default value is -8.  This option
     conflicts with '-w' ('--nowrap'); the last one given takes effect.

'-s PROGRAM'
'--speller=PROGRAM'
     Invoke the given program as the spell checker.  By default, 'nano'
     uses the command specified in the 'SPELL' environment variable, or,
     if 'SPELL' is not set, its own interactive spell checker that
     requires the 'spell' program to be installed on your system.

'-t'
'--tempfile'
     Don't ask whether to save a modified buffer when exiting with ^X,
     but assume yes.  This option is useful when 'nano' is used as the
     composer of a mailer program.

'-u'
'--unix'
     Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano's
     default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.  (This
     option has no effect when you also use '--noconvert'.)

'-v'
'--view'
     Don't allow the contents of the file to be altered.  Note that this
     option should NOT be used in place of correct file permissions to
     implement a read-only file.

'-w'
'--nowrap'
     Don't hard-wrap long lines at any length.  This option conflicts
     with '-r' ('--fill'); the last one given takes effect.

'-x'
'--nohelp'
     Expert Mode: don't show the Shortcut List at the bottom of the
     screen.  This affects the location of the statusbar as well, as in
     Expert Mode it is located at the very bottom of the editor.

     Note: When accessing the help system, Expert Mode is temporarily
     disabled to display the help-system navigation keys.

'-z'
'--suspend'
     Enable the ability to suspend 'nano' using the system's suspend
     keystroke (usually ^Z).

'-$'
'--softwrap'
     Enable 'soft wrapping'.  This will make 'nano' attempt to display
     the entire contents of any line, even if it is longer than the
     screen width, by continuing it over multiple screen lines.  Since
     '$' normally refers to a variable in the Unix shell, you should
     specify this option last when using other options (e.g. 'nano
     -wS$') or pass it separately (e.g. 'nano -wS -$').

'-a'
'-b'
'-e'
'-f'
'-j'
     Ignored, for compatibility with Pico.

File: nano.info,  Node: Entering Text,  Next: Commands,  Up: Editor Basics

4.1 Entering Text
=================

'nano' is a "modeless" editor.  This means that all keystrokes, with the
exception of Control and Meta sequences, enter text into the file being
edited.

   Characters not present on the keyboard can be entered in two ways:

   * For characters with a single-byte code, pressing the Esc key twice
     and then typing a three-digit decimal number (from 000 to 255) will
     make 'nano' behave as if you typed the key with that value.

   * For any possible character, pressing M-V (Alt+V) and then typing a
     six-digit hexadecimal number (starting with 0 or 1) will enter the
     corresponding Unicode character into the buffer.

   For example, typing "Esc Esc 2 3 4" will enter the character "ê" --
useful when going to a French party.  Typing "M-V 0 0 2 5 c 6" will
enter the symbol "◆", a little black diamond.


File: nano.info,  Node: Commands,  Next: The Cutbuffer,  Prev: Entering Text,  Up: Editor Basics

4.2 Commands
============

Commands are given by using the Control key (Ctrl, shown as '^') or the
Meta key (Alt or Cmd, shown as 'M-').

   * A control-key sequence is entered by holding down the Ctrl key and
     pressing the desired key.

   * A meta-key sequence is entered by holding down the Meta key
     (normally the Alt key) and pressing the desired key.

   If for some reason on your system the combinations with Ctrl or Alt
do not work, you can generate them by using the Esc key.  A control-key
sequence is generated by pressing the Esc key twice and then pressing
the desired key, and a meta-key sequence by pressing the Esc key once
and then pressing the desired key.


File: nano.info,  Node: The Cutbuffer,  Next: The Mark,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Editor Basics

4.3 The Cutbuffer
=================

Text can be cut from a file, a whole line at a time, by using the 'Cut
Text' command (default key binding: ^K). The cut line is stored in the
cutbuffer.  Consecutive strokes of ^K will add each cut line to this
buffer, but a ^K after any other keystroke will overwrite the entire
cutbuffer.

   The contents of the cutbuffer can be pasted back into the file with
the 'Uncut Text' command (default key binding: ^U).

   A line of text can be copied into the cutbuffer (without cutting it)
with the 'Copy Text' command (default key binding: M-6).


File: nano.info,  Node: The Mark,  Next: Screen Layout,  Prev: The Cutbuffer,  Up: Editor Basics

4.4 The Mark
============

Text can be selected by first 'setting the Mark' (default key bindings:
^6 and M-A) and then moving the cursor to the other end of the portion
to be selected.  The selected portion of text will be highlighted in
reverse video (or in bold if you set the boldtext option).  This
selection can now be cut or copied in its entirety with a single ^K or
M-6.  Or the selection can be used to limit the scope of a
search-and-replace (^\) or spell-checking session (^T).

   Cutting or copying selected text will toggle the mark off
automatically.  If necessary, it can be toggled off manually with
another ^6 or M-A.


File: nano.info,  Node: Screen Layout,  Next: Search and Replace,  Prev: The Mark,  Up: Editor Basics

4.5 Screen Layout
=================

The default screen of nano consists of five areas.  From top to bottom
these are: the titlebar, a blank line, the edit window, the statusbar,
and two help lines.

   The titlebar consists of three sections: left, center and right.  The
section on the left displays the version of 'nano' being used.  The
center section displays the current filename, or "New Buffer" if the
file has not yet been named.  The section on the right displays
"Modified" if the file has been modified since it was last saved or
opened.

   The statusbar is the third line from the bottom of the screen.  It
shows important and informational messages.  Any error messages that
occur from using the editor will appear on the statusbar.  Any questions
that are asked of the user will be asked on the statusbar, and any user
input (search strings, filenames, etc.)  will be input on the statusbar.

   The two help lines at the bottom of the screen show some of the most
essential functions of the editor.  These two lines are called the
Shortcut List.


File: nano.info,  Node: Search and Replace,  Next: Using the Mouse,  Prev: Screen Layout,  Up: Editor Basics

4.6 Search and Replace
======================

One can search the current buffer for the occurrence of any string with
the Search command (default key binding: ^W). The default search mode is
forward, case-insensitive, and for literal strings.  But one can search
backwards by pressing M-B, search case sensitively with M-C, and
interpret regular expressions in the search string with M-R.

   A regular expression in a search string always covers just one line;
it cannot span multiple lines.  And when replacing (with ^\ or M-R) the
replacement string cannot contain a newline (LF).


File: nano.info,  Node: Using the Mouse,  Next: Limitation,  Prev: Search and Replace,  Up: Editor Basics

4.7 Using the Mouse
===================

When mouse support has been configured and enabled, a single mouse click
places the cursor at the indicated position.  Clicking a second time in
the same position toggles the mark.  Clicking in the shortcut list
executes the selected shortcut.  To be able to select text with the left
button, or paste text with the middle button, hold down the Shift key
during those actions.

   The mouse will work in the X Window System, and on the console when
gpm is running.


File: nano.info,  Node: Limitation,  Prev: Using the Mouse,  Up: Editor Basics

4.8 Limitation
==============

Justifications ('^J') and reindentations ('M-{' and 'M-}') are not yet
covered by the general undo system.  So after a justification that is
not immediately undone, or after any reindentation, earlier edits cannot
be undone any more.  The workaround is, of course, to exit without
saving.


File: nano.info,  Node: Built-in Help,  Next: Feature Toggles,  Prev: Editor Basics,  Up: Top

5 Built-in Help
***************

The built-in help system in 'nano' is available by pressing ^G.  It is
fairly self-explanatory.  It documents the various parts of the editor
and the available keystrokes.  Navigation is via the ^Y (Page Up) and ^V
(Page Down) keys.  ^X exits the help system.


File: nano.info,  Node: Feature Toggles,  Next: Nanorc Files,  Prev: Built-in Help,  Up: Top

6 Feature Toggles
*****************

Toggles allow you to change on-the-fly certain aspects of the editor
which would normally be specified via command-line options.  They are
invoked via Meta-key sequences (see *Note Commands::, for more info).
The following global toggles are available:

File: nano.info,  Node: Nanorc Files,  Next: The File Browser,  Prev: Feature Toggles,  Up: Top

7 Nanorc Files
**************

The nanorc files contain the default settings for 'nano'.  They should
be in Unix format, not in DOS or Mac format.  During startup, 'nano'
will first read the system-wide settings, from /etc/nanorc (the exact
path might be different), and then the user-specific settings, from
'~/.nanorc'.

   A nanorc file accepts a series of "set" and "unset" commands, which
can be used to configure 'nano' on startup without using command-line
options.  Additionally, there are some commands to define syntax
highlighting and to rebind keys -- *Note Syntax Highlighting::, and
*Note Rebinding Keys::.  'nano' will read one command per line.

   Options in nanorc files take precedence over 'nano''s defaults, and
command-line options override nanorc settings.  Also, options that do
not take an argument are unset by default.  So using the 'unset' command
is only needed when wanting to override a setting of the system's nanorc
file in your own '~/.nanorc'.  Options that take an argument cannot be
unset.

   Quotes inside string parameters don't have to be escaped with
backslashes.  The last double quote in the string will be treated as its
end.  For example, for the 'brackets' option, ""')>]}" will match '"',
''', ')', '>', ']', and '}'.

File: nano.info,  Node: Settings,  Next: Syntax Highlighting,  Up: Nanorc Files

7.1 Settings
============

The supported settings in a nanorc file are:

'set allow_insecure_backup'
     When backing up files, allow the backup to succeed even if its
     permissions can't be (re)set due to special OS considerations.  You
     should NOT enable this option unless you are sure you need it.

'set autoindent'
     Use auto-indentation.

'set backup'
     When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the
     current filename suffixed with a tilde ('~').

'set backupdir "directory"'
     Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a
     uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved -- when backups
     are enabled with 'set backup' or '--backup' or '-B'.  The uniquely
     numbered files are stored in the specified directory.

'set backwards'
     Do backwards searches by default.

'set boldtext'
     Use bold instead of reverse video for the titlebar, statusbar, key
     combos, and selected text.  This can be overridden for the first
     three by setting the options 'titlecolor', 'statuscolor', and
     'keycolor'.

'set brackets "STRING"'
     Set the characters treated as closing brackets when justifying
     paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only closing
     punctuation (see 'set punct'), optionally followed by the specified
     closing brackets, can end sentences.  The default value is "')>]}".

'set casesensitive'
     Do case-sensitive searches by default.

'set constantshow'
     Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.  (The old
     form of this option, 'set const', is deprecated.)

'set cut'
     Use cut-to-end-of-line by default, instead of cutting the whole
     line.

'set fill NUMBER'
     Hard-wrap lines at column number NUMBER.  If NUMBER is 0 or less,
     the maximum line length will be the screen width less NUMBER
     columns.  The default value is -8.

'set functioncolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for the function descriptions
     in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.  See 'set
     titlecolor' for more details.

'set historylog'
     Enable the use of '~/.nano/search_history' for saving and reading
     search/replace strings.

'set justifytrim'
     When justifying text, trailing whitespace will automatically be
     removed.

'set keycolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for the shortcut key combos in
     the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.  See 'set
     titlecolor' for more details.

'set linenumbers'
     Display line numbers to the left of the text area.

'set locking'
     Enable vim-style lock-files for when editing files.

'set matchbrackets "STRING"'
     Set the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
     searches.  This may not include blank characters.  The opening set
     must come before the closing set, and the two sets must be in the
     same order.  The default value is "(<[{)>]}".

'set morespace'
     Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.

'set mouse'
     Enable mouse support, so that mouse clicks can be used to place the
     cursor, set the mark (with a double click), or execute shortcuts.

'set multibuffer'
     When reading in a file with ^R, insert it into a new buffer by
     default.

'set noconvert'
     Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format.

'set nohelp'
     Don't display the help lists at the bottom of the screen.

'set nopauses'
     Don't pause between warnings at startup.  This means that only the
     last one will be visible (when there are multiple ones).

'set nonewlines'
     Don't add newlines to the ends of files.

'set nowrap'
     Don't hard-wrap text at all.

'set numbercolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for line numbers.  See 'set
     titlecolor' for more details.

'set operatingdir "directory"'
     'nano' will only read and write files inside "directory" and its
     subdirectories.  Also, the current directory is changed to here, so
     files are inserted from this directory.  By default, the operating
     directory feature is turned off.

'set positionlog'
     Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions.  The
     cursor position is remembered for the 200 most-recently edited
     files.  (The old form of this option, 'set poslog', is deprecated.)

'set preserve'
     Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).

'set punct "STRING"'
     Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying
     paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only the
     specified closing punctuation, optionally followed by closing
     brackets (see 'set brackets'), can end sentences.  The default
     value is "!.?".

'set quickblank'
     Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear
     after 1 keystroke instead of 25.

'set quiet'
     When set, 'nano' will not report errors in the nanorc file nor ask
     them to be acknowledged by pressing Enter at startup.  If this
     option is used, it should be placed at the top of the file to be
     fully effective.

'set quotestr "STRING"'
     The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.
     This is an extended regular expression if your system supports
     them, otherwise a literal string.  The default value is "^([
     \\t]*[#:>\\|}])+" if you have extended regular expression support,
     and "> " otherwise.  Note that '\t' stands for a literal Tab
     character.

'set rebinddelete'
     Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and
     Delete work properly.  You should only need to use this option if
     Backspace acts like Delete on your system.

'set rebindkeypad'
     Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.
     You should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse
     support won't work properly with this option enabled.

'set regexp'
     Do extended regular expression searches by default.

'set showcursor'
     Put the cursor on the highlighted item in the file browser, to aid
     braille users.

'set smarthome'
     Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at
     the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the
     cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).
     If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
     beginning of the line.

'set smooth'
     Use smooth scrolling by default.

'set softwrap'
     Enable soft line wrapping for easier viewing of very long lines.

'set speller "spellprog"'
     Use spelling checker "spellprog" instead of the built-in one, which
     calls "spell".

'set statuscolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for the statusbar.  See 'set
     titlecolor' for more details.

'set suspend'
     Allow 'nano' to be suspended.

'set tabsize NUMBER'
     Use a tab size of NUMBER columns.  The value of NUMBER must be
     greater than 0.  The default value is 8.

'set tabstospaces'
     Convert typed tabs to spaces.

'set tempfile'
     Save automatically on exit, don't prompt.

'set titlecolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for the titlebar.  Valid color
     names for foreground and background are: white, black, blue, green,
     red, cyan, yellow, and magenta.  The name of the foreground color
     may be prefixed with 'bright'.  And either FGCOLOR or ,BGCOLOR may
     be left out.

'set unix'
     Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano's
     default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.  (This
     option has no effect when you also use 'set noconvert'.)

'set view'
     Disallow file modification.

'set whitespace "STRING"'
     Set the two characters used to indicate the presence of tabs and
     spaces.  They must be single-column characters.  The default pair
     for a UTF-8 locale is "»·", and for other locales ">.".

'set wordbounds'
     Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
     characters as part of a word.

'set wordchars "STRING"'
     Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric
     ones) should be considered as parts of words.  This overrides the
     option 'wordbounds'.

7.2 Syntax Highlighting
=======================

Coloring the different syntactic elements of a file is done via regular
expressions (see the 'color' command below).  This is inherently
imperfect, because regular expressions are not powerful enough to fully
parse a file.  Nevertheless, regular expressions can do a lot and are
easy to make, so they are a good fit for a small editor like 'nano'.

   A separate syntax can be defined for each kind of file via the
following commands in a nanorc file:

'syntax "str" ["fileregex" ...]'
     Defines a syntax named "str" which can be activated via the
     '-Y/--syntax' command-line option, or will be automatically
     activated if the current filename matches the extended regular
     expression "fileregex".  All subsequent 'color', 'icolor', 'header'
     and other such statements will apply to this "str" syntax until a
     new 'syntax' command is encountered.

     The "none" syntax is reserved; specifying it on the command line is
     the same as not having a syntax at all.  The "default" syntax is
     special: it takes no "fileregex", and applies to files that don't
     match any syntax's "fileregex".

'linter program [arg ...]'
     Use the given program to do a syntax check on the current file
     (this overrides the speller function when defined).

'formatter program [arg ...]'
     Use the given program to automatically reformat text.  Useful in
     certain programming languages (e.g. Go).

'header "regex" ...'
     Add one or more regexes which will be compared against the very
     first line of the file to be edited, to determine whether this
     syntax should be used for that file.

'magic "regex" ...'
     Add one or more regexes which will be compared against the result
     of querying the magic database about the file to be edited, to
     determine whether this syntax should be used for that file.  This
     functionality only works when libmagic is installed on the system
     and will be silently ignored otherwise.

'comment "string"'
     Use the given string for commenting and uncommenting lines.  A
     vertical bar or pipe character (|) designates bracket-style
     comments; for example, "/*|*/" for CSS files.  The characters
     before the pipe are prepended to the line and the characters after
     the pipe are appended at the end of the line.  If no pipe character
     is present, the entire string is prepended; for example, "#" for
     Python files.  If empty double quotes are specified, the
     comment/uncomment functions are disabled; for example, "" for JSON.
     Double quotes or backslashes may be escaped with a backslash; for
     example, ".\\"" for man page source.

'color fgcolor,bgcolor "regex" ...'
     Display all pieces of text that match the extended regular
     expression "regex" with foreground color "fgcolor" and background
     color "bgcolor", at least one of which must be specified.  Valid
     colors for foreground and background are: white, black, red, blue,
     green, yellow, magenta, and cyan.  You may use the prefix "bright"
     to get a stronger color highlight for the foreground.  If your
     terminal supports transparency, not specifying a "bgcolor" tells
     'nano' to attempt to use a transparent background.

'icolor fgcolor,bgcolor "regex" ...'
     Same as above, except that the text matching is case insensitive.

'color fgcolor,bgcolor start="sr" end="er"'
     Display all pieces of text whose start matches extended regular
     expression "sr" and whose end matches extended regular expression
     "er" with foreground color "fgcolor" and background color
     "bgcolor", at least one of which must be specified.  This means
     that, after an initial instance of "sr", all text will be
     highlighted until the first instance of "er".  This allows syntax
     highlighting to span multiple lines.

'icolor fgcolor,bgcolor start="sr" end="er"'
     Same as above, except that the text matching is case insensitive.

'include "syntaxfile"'
     Read in self-contained color syntaxes from "syntaxfile".  Note that
     "syntaxfile" may contain only the above commands, from 'syntax' to
     'icolor'.

'extendsyntax str directive [arg ...]'
     Extend the syntax previously defined as str to include new
     information.  This allows you to add a new 'color', 'icolor',
     'header', 'magic', 'comment', 'linter', or 'formatter' directive to
     an already defined syntax -- useful when you want to slightly
     improve a syntax defined in one of the system-installed files
     (which are normally not writable).

8 The File Browser
******************

When reading or writing files, pressing ^T will invoke the file browser.
Here, one can navigate directories in a graphical manner in order to
find the desired file.

   Basic movement in the file browser is accomplished with the arrow
keys, page up, and page down.  More advanced movement is accomplished by
searching via ^W (or 'w') and changing directories via ^_ (or 'g').  The
behavior of the Enter (or 's') key varies by what is currently selected.
If the currently selected object is a directory, the file browser will
enter and display the contents of the directory.  If the object is a
file, this filename and path are copied to the statusbar, and the file
browser exits.


File: nano.info,  Node: Pico Compatibility,  Next: Building and Configure Options,  Prev: The File Browser,  Up: Top

9 Pico Compatibility
********************

'nano' attempts to emulate Pico as closely as possible, but there are
some differences between the editors:

'Interactive Replace'
     Instead of allowing you to replace either just one occurrence of a
     search string or all of them, 'nano''s replace function is
     interactive: it will pause at each found search string and query
     whether to replace this instance.  You can then choose Yes, or No
     (skip this one), or All (don't ask any more), or Cancel (stop with
     replacing).

'Search and Replace History'
     When the option '-H' or '--historylog' is given (or set in the
     .nanorc file), text entered as search or replace strings is stored.
     These strings can be accessed with the up/down arrow keys, or you
     can type the first few characters and then use Tab to cycle through
     the matching strings.  A retrieved string can subsequently be
     edited.

'Position History'
     When the option '-P' or '--positionlog' is given (or set in the
     .nanorc file), 'nano' will store the position of the cursor when
     you close a file, and will place the cursor in that position again
     when you later reopen the file.

'Writing Selected Text to Files'
     When using the Write-Out key (^O), text that has been selected
     using the marking key (^^) can not just be written out to a new (or
     existing) file, it can also be appended or prepended to an existing
     file.

'Reading Text from a Command'
     When using the Read-File key (^R), 'nano' can not just read a file,
     it can also read the output of a command to be run (^X).

'File Browser'
     In the file browser, 'nano' does not implement the Add, Copy,
     Rename, and Delete commands that Pico provides.  In 'nano' the
     browser is just a file browser, not a file manager.

'Toggles'
     Many options which alter the functionality of the program can be
     "toggled" on or off using Meta key sequences, meaning the program
     does not have to be restarted to turn a particular feature on or
     off.  See the internal help function (^G) for a list of features
     that can be toggled.  Or see *Note Feature Toggles:: instead.

'Current Cursor Position'
     The output of the "Display Cursor Position" command (^C) displays
     not only the current line and character position of the cursor, but
     also (between the two) the current column position.

'Spell Checking'
     In the internal spell checker misspelled words are sorted
     alphabetically and trimmed for uniqueness, such that the words
     'apple' and 'Apple' will be prompted for correction separately.


File: nano.info,  Node: Building and Configure Options,  Prev: Pico Compatibility,  Up: Top

10 Building and Configure Options
*********************************

Building 'nano' from source is fairly straightforward if you are
familiar with compiling programs with autoconf support:

   * tar xvfz nano-x.y.z.tar.gz (where x.y.z is the version of 'nano')
   * cd nano-x.y.z/
   * ./configure
   * make
   * make install

   The possible options to './configure' are:

'--disable-browser'
     Disable the mini file browser when reading or writing files.

'--disable-color'
     Disable support for the syntax coloring of files.  This also
     eliminates the '-Y' command-line option, which chooses a specific
     syntax.

'--disable-extra'
     Disable extra features.  At the moment, this is just
     easter-egg-type stuff.

'--disable-help'
     Disable the help function.  Doing this makes the binary much
     smaller, but makes it difficult for new users to learn more than
     very basic things about using the editor.

'--disable-histories'
     Disable the code for the handling of the history files: the search
     and replace strings that were used, and the cursor position at
     which each file was closed.  This also eliminates the '-H' and '-P'
     command-line options, which switch on the logging of search/replace
     strings and cursor positions.

'--disable-justify'
     Disable the justify and unjustify functions.

'--disable-libmagic'
     Disable the use of the library of magic-number tests (for
     determining the file type and thus which syntax to use for
     colouring -- often the tests on filename extension and header line
     will be enough).

'--disable-mouse'
     Disable all mouse functionality.  This also eliminates the '-m'
     command-line option, which enables the mouse functionality.

'--disable-multibuffer'
     Disable support for opening multiple files at a time and switching
     between them on the fly.  This also eliminates the '-F'
     command-line option, which causes a file to be read into a separate
     buffer by default.

'--disable-nanorc'
     Disable support for reading the nanorc files at startup.  With such
     support, you can store custom settings in a system-wide and a
     per-user nanorc file rather than having to pass command-line
     options to get the desired behavior.  See *Note Nanorc Files::, for
     more info.  Disabling this also eliminates the '-I' and '-q'
     command-line options; the first inhibits the reading of
     nanorcfiles, and the second suppresses warnings about errors in
     those files.

'--disable-operatingdir'
     Disable setting the operating directory.  This also eliminates the
     '-o' command-line option, which sets the operating directory.

'--disable-speller'
     Disable use of the spell checker.  This also eliminates the '-s'
     command-line option, which allows specifying an alternate spell
     checker.

'--disable-tabcomp'
     Disable tab completion (when nano asks for a filename or a search
     string).

'--disable-wordcomp'
     Disable word completion.

'--disable-wrapping'
     Disable all hard-wrapping of overlong lines.  This also eliminates
     the '-w' command-line option, which switches long-line wrapping
     off.

'--enable-tiny'
     This option implies all of the above.  It also disables some other
     internals of the editor, like the marking code, the
     cut-to-end-of-line code, and the function toggles.  By using the
     enabling counterpart of the above options together with
     '--enable-tiny', specific features can be switched back on -- but a
     few cannot.

'--enable-debug'
     Enable support for runtime debug output.  This can get pretty
     messy, so chances are you only want this feature when you're
     working on the nano source.

'--disable-nls'
     Disables Native Language support.  This will disable the use of any
     available GNU 'nano' translations.

'--disable-wrapping-as-root'
     Disable hard-wrapping of overlong lines by default when 'nano' is
     run as root.

'--enable-utf8'
     Enable support for reading and writing Unicode files.  This will
     require either a wide version of curses, or a UTF-8-enabled version
     of Slang.

'--disable-utf8'
     Disable support for reading and writing Unicode files.  Normally
     the configure script auto-detects whether to enable UTF-8 support
     or not.  You can use this or the previous option to override that
     detection.

'--enable-altrcname=NAME'
     Use the file with the given NAME (in the user's home directory) as
     nano's settings file, instead of the default '.nanorc'.

'--with-slang'
     Compile 'nano' against Slang instead of against ncurses or other
     curses libraries.
