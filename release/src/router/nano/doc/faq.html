<h1><a name="1"></a>1. General</h1>
<h2><a name="1.1"></a>1.1 About this FAQ</h2>
<blockquote><p>This FAQ was originally written and maintained by Chris Allegretta &lt;<a href="mailto:chrisa@asty.org">chrisa@asty.org</a>&gt;, who also happens to be the creator of nano. It was then maintained by David Lawrence Ramsey &lt;<a href="mailto:pooka109@gmail.com">pooka109@gmail.com</a>&gt;. Maybe someone else will volunteer to maintain this FAQ someday, who knows...</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="1.2"></a>1.2. How do I contribute to it?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Your best bet is to send it to the nano email address, <a href="mailto:nano@nano-editor.org">nano@nano-editor.org</a> and if it is useful enough it will be included in future versions.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="1.3"></a>1.3. What is GNU nano?</h2>
<blockquote><p>GNU nano is designed to be a free replacement for the Pico text editor, part of the Pine email suite from <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">The University of Washington</a>. It aims to &quot;emulate Pico as closely as possible and then include extra functionality&quot;.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="1.4"></a>1.4. What is the history behind nano?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Funny you should ask!</p>
  <p><b>In the beginning...</b></p>
  <p>For years Pine was THE program used to read email on a Unix system. The Pico text editor is the portion of the program one would use to compose his or her mail messages. Many beginners to Unix flocked to Pico and Pine because of their well organized, easy to use interfaces. With the proliferation of GNU/Linux in the mid to late 90's, many University students became intimately familiar with the strengths (and weaknesses) of Pine and Pico.</p>
  <p><b>Then came Debian...</b></p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> distribution, known for its strict standards in distributing truly &quot;free&quot; software (i.e. software with no restrictions on redistribution), would not include a binary package for Pine or Pico. Many people had a serious dilemma: they loved these programs, but the versions available at the time were not truly free software in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">GNU</a> sense of the word.</p>
  <p><b>The event...</b></p>
  <p>It was in late 1999 when Chris Allegretta (our hero) was yet again complaining to himself about the less-than-perfect license Pico was distributed under, the 1000 makefiles that came with it and how just a few small improvements could make it the Best Editor in the World (TM). Having been a convert from Slackware to Debian, he missed having a simple binary package that included Pine and Pico, and had grown tired of downloading them himself.</p>
  <p>Finally something snapped inside and Chris coded and hacked like a madman for many hours straight one weekend to make a (barely usable) Pico clone, at the time called TIP (Tip Isn't Pico). The program could not be invoked without a filename, could not save files, had no help text display, spell checker, and so forth. But over time it improved, and with the help of a few great coders it matured to the (hopefully) stable state it is in today.</p>
  <p>In February 2001, nano was declared an official GNU program by Richard Stallman. nano also reached its first production release on March 22, 2001.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="1.5"></a>1.5. Why the name change from TIP?</h2>
<blockquote><p>On January 10, 2000, TIP was officially renamed to nano because of a namespace conflict with another program called 'tip'. The original 'tip' program &quot;establishes a full duplex terminal connection to a remote host&quot;, and was included with many older Unix systems (and newer ones like Solaris). The conflict was not noticed at first because there is no 'tip' utility included with most GNU/Linux distributions (where nano was developed).</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="1.6"></a>1.6. What is the current version of nano?</h2>
<blockquote><p>The current version of nano <i>should</i> be <b>2.7.4</b>.  Of course, you should always check the <a href="https://nano-editor.org/">nano homepage</a> to see what the latest and greatest version is.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="1.7"></a>1.7. I want to read the man page without having to download the program!</h2>
<blockquote><p>Jeez, demanding, aren't we? Okay, look <a href="https://nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.1.html">here</a>.</p></blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2><a name="2.4"></a>2.4. By GIT (for the brave).</h2>
<blockquote><p>For the 'bleeding edge' current version of nano, you can use GIT to download the current source code. <b>Note:</b> believe it or not, by downloading code that has not yet stabilized into an official release, there could quite possibly be bugs, in fact the code may not even compile! Anyway, see <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/nano.git/tree/README.GIT">the nano GIT document</a> for info on anonymous GIT access to the nano source.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="3"></a>3. Installation and Configuration</h1>
<h2><a name="3.1"></a>3.1. How do I install the RPM or DEB package?</h2>
<blockquote><p>It's simple really! As root, type <b>rpm -Uvh nano-x.y.z-1.i386.rpm</b> if you have a RedHat-ish system or <b>dpkg -i nano_x.y.z-1.deb</b> if you have a Debian-ish system, where <b>x.y.z</b> is the release of nano. There are other programs to install packages, and if you wish to use those, knock yourself out.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="3.2"></a>3.2. Compiling from source: WHAT THE HECK DO I DO NOW?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Okay, take a deep breath, this really isn't hard. Unpack the nano source with a command like:</p>
  <p><b>tar -xvf nano-x.y.z.tar.gz</b></p>
  <p>Then you need to run <b>configure</b> with any options you might want (if any).</p>
  <p>The average case is this:</p>
  <p><b>cd nano-x.y.z/</b><br>
  <b>./configure</b><br>
  <b>make</b><br>
  <b>make install</b> (as root, of course)</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="3.3"></a>3.3. Why does everything go into /usr/local?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Well, that's what the <b>configure</b> script defaults to. If you wish to change this, simply do this:</p>
  <p><b>./configure --prefix=/usr</b></p>
  <p>to put nano into /usr/bin when you run <b>make install</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="3.5"></a>3.5. nano should automatically run strip on the binary when installing it!</h2>
<blockquote><p>Actually, it does, but you have to use <b>make install-strip</b>. The default make install does not, and will not, run strip automatically.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="3.6"></a>3.6. How can I make the executable smaller? This is too bloated!</h2>
<blockquote><p>Actually, there are several parts of the editor that can be disabled. You can pass arguments to the <b>configure</b> script that disable certain features. Here's a brief list:</p>
  <pre>
  <b>--disable-browser</b>       Disable the built-in file browser
  <b>--disable-color</b>         Disable color and syntax highlighting
  <b>--disable-extra</b>         Disable extra features (currently only an easter egg)
  <b>--disable-help</b>          Disable help functions
  <b>--disable-histories</b>     Disable the saving of search strings and cursor positions
  <b>--disable-justify</b>       Disable justify/unjustify functions
  <b>--disable-libmagic</b>      Disable the use of libmagic for determining a file's syntax
  <b>--disable-mouse</b>         Disable mouse support
  <b>--disable-multibuffer</b>   Disable having multiple file buffers open
  <b>--disable-nanorc</b>        Disable the use of .nanorc files
  <b>--disable-operatingdir</b>  Disable the setting of an operating directory
  <b>--disable-speller</b>       Disable spell checker functions
  <b>--disable-tabcomp</b>       Disable tab completion functions
  <b>--disable-wordcomp</b>      Disable the word completion function
  <b>--disable-wrapping</b>      Disable all hard-wrapping of text</pre>
  <p>There's also the <b>--enable-tiny</b> option which disables everything above, as well as some larger chunks of the program (like the marker code that you use with Control-^ to select text). Also, if you know you aren't going to be using other languages, you can use <b>--disable-nls</b> to disable internationalization and save a few K to a few dozen K depending on whether you have locale support on your system. And finally, there's always good old <b>strip</b> to strip all debugging code and code that exists in libraries on your system.</p>
  <p>With <b>--disable-wrapping-as-root</b> you can disable any hard-wrapping by default when the user is root, useful to prevent accidentally changing long lines in system configuration files.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="3.7"></a>3.7. Tell me more about this multibuffer stuff!</h2>
<blockquote><p>To use multiple file buffers, you must not have configured nano with <b>--disable-multibuffer</b> nor with <b>--enable-tiny</b> (use <b>nano -V</b> to check the compilation options). Then when you want to insert a file into its own buffer instead of into the current file, just hit <b>Meta-F</b>, then insert the file as normal with <b>^R</b>. If you always want files to be loaded into their own buffers, use the <b>--multibuffer</b> or <b>-F</b> flag when you invoke nano.</p>
  <p>You can move between the buffers you have open with the <b>Meta-&lt;</b> and <b>Meta-&gt;</b> keys, or more easily without holding Shift: <b>Meta-,</b> and <b>Meta-.</b> (clear as mud, right? =-). When you have more than one file buffer open, the ^X shortcut will say &quot;Close&quot;, instead of the normal &quot;Exit&quot; when only one buffer is open.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="3.8"></a>3.8. Tell me more about this verbatim input stuff!</h2>
<blockquote><p>When you want to insert a literal character into the file you're editing, such as a control character that nano usually treats as a command, first press <b>Meta-V</b> (if you're not at a prompt, you'll get the message &quot;Verbatim Input&quot; on the statusbar), then press the key(s) that generate the character you want.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, if you've enabled Unicode support (see section <a href="#5.3">5.3</a>), you can press <b>Meta-V</b> and then type a six-digit hexadecimal code (from 000000 to 10FFFF, case-insensitive), and the character with the corresponding value will be inserted. The statubar will change to &quot;Unicode Input: ......&quot; when you do this.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="3.9a"></a>3.9a. How do I make a .nanorc file that will be read when I start nano?</h2>
<blockquote><p>It's not hard at all! But, your nano must <b>not</b> have been compiled with <b>--disable-nanorc</b>. Then simply copy the <b>sample.nanorc</b> that came with the nano source or your nano package (most likely in /usr/doc/nano) to .nanorc in your home directory. If you didn't get one, the syntax of the file is simple. Flags are turned on and off by using the words <b>set</b> and <b>unset</b> plus the long option name for the feature. For example, &quot;set nowrap&quot; or &quot;set smarthome&quot;.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="3.9b"></a>3.9b. How about in Win32?</h2>
<blockquote><p>If you're using the official nano .zip file and have extracted all the files, you should take the file nano.rc and place it somewhere on your Win32 system (for example, if you have write permission to do so, at the top of C:\).  Then you must create an Environment variable called HOME which points to the directory where you put nano.rc.  In Windows XP, you can get to Environment variables by right-clicking "My Computer" either on the desktop or in the Start Menu, and selecting Properties.  This should bring up the System Properties panel.  Then click the Advanced Tab, and there should be a button called Environment Variables.  Click that to bring up the Environment Variables section. Now, under User Variables you should be able to click the New button, and make a new Variables Name called HOME, with the Variable Value of whatever path you copied nano.rc into (just the directory name; don't add nano.rc onto the end).</p>
<p>We're still working on documentation for enabling syntax highlighting on Win32; please bear with us.</p>
<p>Note that the nano.rc file must remain Unix-formatted in order for nano to understand it.  In other words, you should probably use only nano to edit its config file.  Other programs like Wordpad and Notepad will convert the file to DOS format when saving, and the latter does not even properly read Unix-formatted files to begin with.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="4"></a>4. Running</h1>
<h2><a name="4.1"></a>4.1. How do I open a file with a name beginning with '+' from the command line?</h2>
<blockquote><p>If a command-line option that begins with '+' is followed by another option, the former is always treated as a starting line and column number, and the latter is always treated as a filename. If a command-line option that begins with '+' isn't followed by another option, it's always treated as a filename. Examples:</p>
  <p>To open '+filename.txt' starting on line 1: <b>nano +filename.txt</b><br>
  To open '+filename.txt' starting on line 10: <b>nano +10 +filename.txt</b><br>
  To open '+filename.txt' starting on line 1, column 20: <b>nano +,20 +filename.txt</b><br>
  To open '+filename.txt' starting on line 10, column 20: <b>nano +10,20 +filename.txt</b><br>
  To open '+filename.txt' starting on line 1 and 'filename.txt' starting on line 40 (if nano has been compiled with multibuffer support): <b>nano +1 +filename.txt +40 filename.txt</b></p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.2"></a>4.2. Ack! My Backspace/Delete/Enter/Meta/double bucky key doesn't seem to work! What can I do?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Try setting your $TERM variable to 'vt100'. nano doesn't yet support every term entry under the sun.</p>
  <p>Bourne shell users (bash and sh): <b>export TERM=vt100</b><br>
  C Shell users (tcsh and csh): <b>setenv TERM vt100</b></p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.3"></a>4.3. Ack! My numeric keypad's keys don't work properly when NumLock is off! What can I do?</h2>
<blockquote><p>You can use the <b>-K</b> or <b>--rebindkeypad</b> option on the command line, or add the line <b>set rebindkeypad</b> to your .nanorc. However, nano's mouse support won't work properly if you do any of these things.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.4"></a>4.4. Ack! When I hold down a Meta key combination for a while, the character of the held key gets inserted now and then. What gives?</h2>
<blockquote><p>This is a bug in the terminal, not in nano. When a key is repeating faster than nano can process it, the keyboard buffer becomes full and starts dropping incoming keystrokes. Unfortunately, it doesn't just drop whole keystrokes; it can also drop parts of multibyte key combinations, resulting in nano's receiving a wrong key.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.5"></a>4.5. How do I type the F13-F16 keys shown in the help browser? My keyboard only has F1-F12!</h2>
<blockquote><p>It depends on the terminal type you're using. On some terminals, such as the FreeBSD console, xterm, konsole, and gnome-terminal, Shift-F1 to Shift-F4 will generate F13 to F16. On other terminals, such as the Linux console, rxvt, and Eterm, Shift-F3 to Shift-F6 will generate F13 to F16.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.6"></a>4.6. nano crashes when I type &lt;insert keystroke here&gt;!</h2>
<blockquote><p>If you aren't trying some bizarre keystroke combination with some bizarre $TERM entry, chances are you have found a bug. You are welcome to submit it to the <a href="mailto:nano-devel@gnu.org">nano-devel</a> list or in the <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano">bug tracker</a> on Savannah.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.7"></a>4.7. nano crashes when I resize my window. How can I fix that?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Older versions of nano had this problem.  Please upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.8"></a>4.8. When I paste text into a document, each line gets indented further than the last. Why does nano do this, and how can I avoid it?</h2>
<blockquote><p>You have the autoindent feature turned on. Hit Meta-I to turn it off, paste your text, and then hit Meta-I again to turn it back on.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.9"></a>4.9. I've compiled nano with color support, but I don't see any color when I run it!</h2>
<blockquote><p>If you want nano to actually use color, you have to specify the color configurations you want it to use in your .nanorc. Several example configurations are in the <b>doc/syntax</b> subdirectory of the nano source, which are normally installed to <b>/usr/local/share/nano</b>. To enable all of them, uncomment the line <b># include "/usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc"</b> in your nanorc. See also section <a href="#3.9a">3.9a</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.10"></a>4.10. How do I make nano my default editor (in Pine, mutt, etc.)?</h2>
<blockquote><p>You need to make nano your $EDITOR. If you want this to be saved, you should put a line like this in your <b>.bashrc</b> if you use bash (or <b>.zshrc</b> if you believe in zsh):</p>
  <p><b>export EDITOR=/usr/local/bin/nano</b></p>
  <p>or, if you use tcsh, put this in your <b>.cshrc</b> file:</p>
  <p><b>setenv EDITOR /usr/local/bin/nano</b></p>
  <p>Change /usr/local/bin/nano to wherever nano is installed on your system. Type &quot;which nano&quot; to find out. This will not take effect until the next time you log in. So log out and back in again.</p>
  <p>Then, on top of that, if you use Pine, you must go into setup (type <b>S</b> at the main menu), and then configure (type <b>C</b>). Hit Enter on the lines that say:</p>
  <p><b>[ ] enable-alternate-editor-cmd</b><br>
  <b>[ ] enable-alternate-editor-implicitly</b></p>
  <p>Then exit (<b>E</b>) and select Yes (<b>Y</b>).</p>
  <p>If you're a mutt user, you should see an effect immediately the next time you log in. No further configuration is needed. However, if you want to let people know you use nano to compose your email messages, you can put a line like this in your <b>.muttrc</b>:</p>
  <p><b>my_hdr X-Composer: nano x.y.z</b></p>
  <p>Again, replace x.y.z with the version of nano you use.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.11"></a>4.11. How do I select text for or paste text from the clipboard in an X terminal when I'm running nano in one and nano's mouse support is turned on?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Try holding down the Shift key and selecting or pasting the text as you normally would.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="4.12"></a>4.12. On startup I get a message that says "Detected a legacy nano history file".  Now older nano versions can't find my search history!</h2>
<blockquote><p>In nano 2.3.0, cursor-position history was introduced, and both history files now reside in a .nano subdirectory in your home directory.  A newer nano will move an existing search-history file to this new location so it can continue to be used.  This means that if you then try and use an earlier version of nano, it will be unable to see your current search history.  To fix this, run the following command:<br>
  <p><b>ln -sf ~/.nano/search_history ~/.nano_history</b></p>
</p><p>The "migration service" (moving the search-history file to its new location) will be deleted from nano in early 2018.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="5"></a>5. Internationalization</h1>
<h2><a name="5.1"></a>5.1. There's no translation for my language!</h2>
<blockquote><p>In June 2001, GNU nano entered the <a href="http://translationproject.org/html/welcome.html">Translation Project</a> and since then, translations should be managed from there.</p>
  <p>If there isn't a translation for your language, you could ask <a href="http://translationproject.org/team/">your language team</a> to translate nano, or better still, join that team and do it yourself. Joining a team is easy. You just need to ask the team leader to add you, and then send a <a href="http://translationproject.org/disclaim.txt">translation disclaimer to the FSF</a> (this is necessary as nano is an official GNU package, but it does <b>not</b> mean that you transfer the rights of your work to the FSF, it's just so the FSF can legally manage them).</p>
  <p>In any case, translating nano is very easy. Just grab the latest <b>nano.pot</b> file listed on <a href="http://translationproject.org/domain/nano.html">nano's page</a> at the TP, and translate each <b>msgid</b> line into your native language on the <b>msgstr</b> line. When you're done, you should send it to the TP's central po repository.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="5.2"></a>5.2. I don't like the translation for &lt;x&gt; in my language. How can I fix it?</h2>
<blockquote><p>The best way would probably be to send an e-mail to the team's mailing listed mentione in the <code>Language-Team:</code> field in the <b>&lt;your_language&gt;.po</b> file with your suggested corrections, and then they can make the changes reach the nano-devel list.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="5.3"></a>5.3. What is the status of Unicode support?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Since versions 1.3.12, Unicode should be usable. With your terminal, locale (LC_ALL and similar environment variables), and encoding configured to properly support UTF-8, you should be able to enter and save Unicode text.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="6"></a>6. Advocacy and Licensing</h1>
<h2><a name="6.1"></a>6.1. Why should I use nano instead of Pico?</h2>
<blockquote><p>There are many reasons to use nano instead of Pico. A more complete list can be found at the <a href="https://nano-editor.org/">nano homepage</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="6.2"></a>6.2. Why should I use Pico instead of nano?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Again, check out the <a href="https://nano-editor.org/">nano homepage</a> for a good summary of reasons. It really is a matter of personal preference as to which editor you should use. If you're the type of person who likes using the original version of a program, then Pico is the editor for you. If you don't mind sacrificing mailer integration with Pine, and are looking for a few more features, as well as a 'better' license in terms of adding your own changes, nano is the way to go.</p><p>Note that the last of these no longer applies to the new version of Pine, <a href="http://www.washington.edu/alpine/">Alpine</a>, which is under the Apache License, version 2.0.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="6.3"></a>6.3. What is so bad about the older Pine license?</h2>
<blockquote><p>The U of W license for older versions of Pine and Pico is not considered truly Free Software according to both the Free Software Foundation and the <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>. The main problem regards the limitations on distributing derived works: according to UW, you can distribute their software, and you can modify it, but you can not do both, i.e. distribute modified binaries.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="6.4"></a>6.4. Okay, well, what mail program should I use then?</h2>
<blockquote><p>If you are looking to use a Free Software program similar to Pine, and Emacs is not your thing, you should definitely take a look at <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a>. It is a full-screen, console based mail program that actually has a lot more flexibility than Pine, but has a keymap included in the distribution that allows you to use the same keystrokes as Pine would to send and receive mail. It's also under the GNU General Public License, version 2.0.<P>
Of course, due to the license change you can now use the <A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/alpine/">Alpine distribution</A> of PINE as it is now considered Free Software, but you would be sacrificing many of nano's features to do so.</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="7"></a>7. Miscellaneous</h1>
<h2><a name="7.1"></a>7.1. nano-related mailing lists.</h2>
<blockquote><p>There are three mailing lists for nano hosted at <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a>: info-nano, help-nano and nano-devel. info-nano is a very low traffic list where new versions of nano are announced (surprise!). help-nano is for getting help with the editor without needing to hear all of the development issues surrounding it. nano-devel is a normally low, sometimes high traffic list for discussing the present and future development of nano. Here are links to where you can sign up for a given list:</p>
  <p>info-nano - <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-nano/">http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-nano/</a><br>
  help-nano - <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-nano/">http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-nano/</a><br>
  nano-devel - <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/nano-devel/">http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/nano-devel/</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="7.2"></a>7.2. I want to send the development team a big load of cash (or just a thank you).</h2>
<blockquote><p>That's fine. Send it <a href="mailto:nano-devel@gnu.org">our way</a>! Better yet, fix a <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano">bug</a> in the program or implement a <a href="https://nano-editor.org/dist/latest/TODO">cool feature</a> and send us that instead (though cash is fine too).</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="7.3"></a>7.3. How do I submit a bug report or patch?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The best place to submit bugs is to the <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano">Savannah bug tracker</a> as you can check whether the bug you are submitting has already been submitted.
<p>Please submit patches for nano via the <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?group=nano">Savannah project's patch manager</a> for the nano project.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="7.4"></a>7.4. How do I join the development team?</h2>
<blockquote><p>The easiest way is to consistently send in good patches that add some needed functionality, fix a bug or two, and/or make the program more optimized/efficient. Then ask nicely and you will probably be added to the Savannah development list and be given write access after a while. There is a lot of responsibility that goes along with being a team member, so don't think it's just something to add to your resume.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="7.5"></a>7.5. Can I have write access to the git tree?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Re-read section <a href="#7.4">7.4</a> and you should know the answer.</p></blockquote>
