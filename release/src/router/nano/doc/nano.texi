@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

GNU @code{nano} is a small and friendly text editor.  Besides basic text
editing, @code{nano} offers many extra features, such as an interactive
search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling,
auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles,
file locking, backup files, and internationalization support.

The original goal for @code{nano} was to be a complete bug-for-bug
emulation of Pico.  But currently the goal is to be as compatible
as possible while offering a superset of Pico's functionality.  See
@xref{Pico Compatibility}, for more info.

Please report bugs via @url{https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano}.


@node Invoking
@chapter Invoking

The usual way to invoke @code{nano} is:

@quotation
@code{nano [FILE]}
@end quotation

But it is also possible to specify one or more options (see the next
section), and to edit several files in a row.  Additionally, the cursor
can be put on a specific line of a file by adding the line number
with a plus sign before the filename, and even in a specific column by
adding it with a comma.  So a more complete command synopsis is:

@quotation
@code{nano [OPTION]@dots{} [[+LINE[,COLUMN]|+,COLUMN] FILE]@dots{}}
@end quotation

Normally, however, you set your preferred options in a @file{.nanorc}
file (see @xref{Nanorc Files}).  And when using @code{set positionlog}
(making @code{nano} remember the cursor position when you close a file),
you will rarely need to specify a line number.

As a special case: when the first file specified is a dash, @code{nano}
will read data from standard input.  Which means you can pipe the output
of a command straight into a buffer.

@node Command-line Options
@chapter Command-line Options

@command{nano} takes the following options from the command line:

@table @option

@item -A
@itemx --smarthome
Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will
jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the cursor is
already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the
line.

@item -B
@itemx --backup
When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the current
filename suffixed with a tilde (@code{~}).

@item -C @var{directory}
@itemx --backupdir=@var{directory}
Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a uniquely
numbered one every time a file is saved --- when backups are enabled.
The uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified directory.

@item -D
@itemx --boldtext
Use bold text instead of reverse video text.

@item -E
@itemx --tabstospaces
Convert typed tabs to spaces.

@item -F
@itemx --multibuffer
Read a file into a new buffer by default.

@item -G
@itemx --locking
Enable vim-style file locking when editing files.

@item -H
@itemx --historylog
Log search and replace strings to @file{~/.nano/search_history},
so they can be retrieved in later sessions.

@item -I
@itemx --ignorercfiles
Don't look at the system's nanorc file nor at the user's @file{~/.nanorc}.

@item -K
@itemx --rebindkeypad
Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.  You
should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse support
won't work properly with this option enabled.

@item -L
@itemx --nonewlines
Don't add newlines to the ends of files.

@item -N
@itemx --noconvert
Disable automatic conversion of files from DOS/Mac format.

@item -O
@itemx --morespace
Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.

@item -P
@itemx --positionlog
For the 200 most recent files, log the last position of the cursor,
and place it at that position again upon reopening such a file.
(The old form of this option, @code{--poslog}, is deprecated.)

@item -Q "@var{characters}"
@itemx --quotestr="@var{characters}"
Set the quoting string for justifying.  The default value is
@t{"^([ \t]*[|>:@}#])+"} if extended regular expression support
is available, and @t{"> "} otherwise.
Note that @code{\t} stands for a literal Tab character.

@item -R
@itemx --restricted
Restricted mode: don't read or write to any file not specified on the
command line; don't read any nanorc files nor history files; don't allow
suspending nor spell checking; don't
allow a file to be appended to, prepended to, or saved under a different
name if it already has one; and don't use backup files.
This restricted mode is also accessible by invoking @command{nano} with
any name beginning with @code{r} (e.g.@: @command{rnano}).

@item -S
@itemx --smooth
Enable smooth scrolling.  Text will scroll line-by-line, instead of the
usual chunk-by-chunk behavior.

@item -T @var{number}
@itemx --tabsize=@var{number}
Set the displayed tab length to @var{number} columns.  The value of
@var{number} must be greater than 0.  The default value is @t{8}.

@item -U
@itemx --quickblank
Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear after 1
keystroke instead of 25.  Note that option @option{-c}
(@option{--constantshow}) overrides this.

@item -V
@itemx --version
Show the current version number and exit.

@item -W
@itemx --wordbounds
Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
characters as parts of words.

@item -X "@var{characters}"
@itemx --wordchars="@var{characters}"
Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric ones)
should be considered as parts of words.  This overrides option
@option{-W} (@option{--wordbounds}).

@item -Y @var{name}
@itemx --syntax=@var{name}
Specify a specific syntax from the nanorc files to use for highlighting.
See @xref{Syntax Highlighting}, for more info.

@item -c
@itemx --constantshow
Constantly display the cursor position and line number on the statusbar.
Note that this overrides option @option{-U} (@option{--quickblank}).

@item -d
@itemx --rebinddelete
Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and Delete
work properly.  You should only need to use this option if Backspace
acts like Delete on your system.

@item -g
@itemx --showcursor
Make the cursor visible in the file browser, putting it on the
highlighted item.  Useful for braille users.

@item -h
@itemx --help
Show a summary of command-line options and exit.

@item -i
@itemx --autoindent
Automatically indent new lines to the same number of spaces and tabs as
the previous line.

@item -k
@itemx --cut
Make the 'Cut Text' command (normally ^K) cut from the current cursor
position to the end of the line, instead of cutting the entire line.

@item -l
@itemx --linenumbers
Display line numbers to the left of the text area.

@item -m
@itemx --mouse
Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled, mouse
clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a double
click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X Window
System, and on the console when gpm is running.  Text can still be
selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.

@item -n
@itemx --noread
Treat any name given on the command line as a new file.  This allows
@command{nano} to write to named pipes: it will start with a blank buffer,
and will write to the pipe when the user saves the "file".  This way
@command{nano} can be used as an editor in combination with for instance
@command{gpg} without having to write sensitive data to disk first.

@item -o @var{directory}
@itemx --operatingdir=@var{directory}
Set the operating directory.  This makes @command{nano} set up something
similar to a chroot.

@item -p
@itemx --preserve
Preserve the ^Q (XON) and ^S (XOFF) sequences so data being sent to the
editor can be stopped and started.

@item -q
@itemx --quiet
Do not report errors in the nanorc file nor ask them to be acknowledged
by pressing Enter at startup.

@item -r @var{number}
@itemx --fill=@var{number}
Hard-wrap lines at column @var{number} (by inserting a newline character).
If the given value is 0 or less, wrapping will occur at the width of
the screen minus the given amount, allowing the wrapping width to
vary along with the width of the screen if and when it is resized.
The default value is @t{-8}.  This option conflicts with @option{-w}
(@option{--nowrap}); the last one given takes effect.

@item -s @var{program}
@itemx --speller=@var{program}
Invoke the given program as the spell checker.  By default, @command{nano}
uses the command specified in the @env{SPELL} environment variable, or,
if @env{SPELL} is not set, its own interactive spell checker that requires
the @command{spell} program to be installed on your system.

@item -t
@itemx --tempfile
Don't ask whether to save a modified buffer when exiting with ^X, but
assume yes.  This option is useful when @command{nano} is used as the
composer of a mailer program.

@item -u
@item --unix
Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano's
default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.
(This option has no effect when you also use @code{--noconvert}.)

@item -v
@itemx --view
Don't allow the contents of the file to be altered.  Note that this
option should NOT be used in place of correct file permissions to
implement a read-only file.

@item -w
@itemx --nowrap
Don't hard-wrap long lines at any length.  This option conflicts with
@option{-r} (@option{--fill}); the last one given takes effect.

@anchor{Expert Mode}
@item -x
@itemx --nohelp
Expert Mode: don't show the Shortcut List at the bottom of the screen.
This affects the location of the statusbar as well, as in Expert Mode it
is located at the very bottom of the editor.

Note: When accessing the help system, Expert Mode is temporarily
disabled to display the help-system navigation keys.

@item -z
@itemx --suspend
Enable the ability to suspend @command{nano} using the system's suspend
keystroke (usually ^Z).

@item -$
@itemx --softwrap
Enable 'soft wrapping'.  This will make @command{nano} attempt to display the
entire contents of any line, even if it is longer than the screen width, by
continuing it over multiple screen lines.  Since
@code{$} normally refers to a variable in the Unix shell, you should specify
this option last when using other options (e.g.@: @code{nano -wS$}) or pass it
separately (e.g.@: @code{nano -wS -$}).

@item -a
@itemx -b
@itemx -e
@itemx -f
@itemx -j
Ignored, for compatibility with Pico.

@node Entering Text
@section Entering Text

@code{nano} is a "modeless" editor.  This means that all keystrokes,
with the exception of Control and Meta sequences, enter text into the
file being edited.

Characters not present on the keyboard can be entered in two ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
For characters with a single-byte code,
pressing the Esc key twice and then typing a three-digit decimal number
(from 000 to 255) will make @code{nano} behave as if you typed the key
with that value.

@item
For any possible character, pressing M-V (Alt+V) and then typing a
six-digit hexadecimal number (starting with 0 or 1) will enter the
corresponding Unicode character into the buffer.
@end itemize

For example, typing "Esc Esc 2 3 4" will enter the character "ê" ---
useful when going to a French party.  Typing "M-V 0 0 2 5 c 6" will
enter the symbol "◆", a little black diamond.

@node Commands
@section Commands

Commands are given by using the Control key (Ctrl, shown as @code{^})
or the Meta key (Alt or Cmd, shown as @code{M-}).

@itemize @bullet
@item
A control-key sequence is entered by holding down the Ctrl key and
pressing the desired key.

@item
A meta-key sequence is entered by holding down the Meta key (normally
the Alt key) and pressing the desired key.
@end itemize

If for some reason on your system the combinations with Ctrl or Alt do
not work, you can generate them by using the Esc key.  A control-key
sequence is generated by pressing the Esc key twice and then pressing
the desired key, and a meta-key sequence by pressing the Esc key once
and then pressing the desired key.

@node The Cutbuffer
@section The Cutbuffer

Text can be cut from a file, a whole line at a time, by using the 'Cut Text'
command (default key binding: ^K).  The cut line is stored in the cutbuffer.
Consecutive strokes of ^K will add each cut line to this buffer, but a ^K
after any other keystroke will overwrite the entire cutbuffer.

The contents of the cutbuffer can be pasted back into the file with the
'Uncut Text' command (default key binding: ^U).

A line of text can be copied into the cutbuffer (without cutting it) with
the 'Copy Text' command (default key binding: M-6).

@node The Mark
@section The Mark

Text can be selected by first 'setting the Mark' (default key bindings:
^6 and M-A) and then moving the cursor to the other end of the portion
to be selected.  The selected portion of text will be highlighted in
reverse video (or in bold if you set the boldtext option).
This selection can now be cut or copied in its entirety with a single
^K or M-6.  Or the selection can be used to limit the scope of a
search-and-replace (^\) or spell-checking session (^T).

Cutting or copying selected text will toggle the mark off automatically.
If necessary, it can be toggled off manually with another ^6 or M-A.

@node Screen Layout
@section Screen Layout

The default screen of nano consists of five areas.  From top to bottom
these are: the titlebar, a blank line, the edit window, the statusbar,
and two help lines.

The titlebar consists of
three sections: left, center and right.  The section on the left
displays the version of @code{nano} being used.  The center section
displays the current filename, or "New Buffer" if the file has not yet
been named.  The section on the right displays "Modified" if the
file has been modified since it was last saved or opened.

The statusbar is the third line from the bottom of the screen.  It
shows important and informational messages.  Any error messages that
occur from using the editor will appear on the statusbar.  Any questions
that are asked of the user will be asked on the statusbar, and any user
input (search strings, filenames, etc.) will be input on the statusbar.

The two help lines at the bottom of the screen show some of the most
essential functions of the editor.  These two lines are called the
Shortcut List.

@node Search and Replace
@section Search and Replace

One can search the current buffer for the occurrence of any string
with the Search command (default key binding: ^W).  The default search
mode is forward, case-insensitive, and for literal strings.  But one
can search backwards by pressing M-B, search case sensitively with M-C,
and interpret regular expressions in the search string with M-R.

A regular expression in a search string always covers just one line;
it cannot span multiple lines.  And when replacing (with ^\ or M-R)
the replacement string cannot contain a newline (LF).

@node Using the Mouse
@section Using the Mouse

When mouse support has been configured and enabled, a single mouse click
places the cursor at the indicated position.  Clicking a second time in
the same position toggles the mark.  Clicking in the shortcut list
executes the selected shortcut.  To be able to select text with the
left button, or paste text with the middle button, hold down the
Shift key during those actions.

The mouse will work in the X Window System, and on the console when gpm
is running.

@node Limitation
@section Limitation

Justifications (@code{^J}) and reindentations (@code{M-@{} and @code{M-@}})
are not yet covered by the general undo system.  So after a justification
that is not immediately undone, or after any reindentation, earlier edits
cannot be undone any more.  The workaround is, of course, to exit without
saving.


@node Built-in Help
@chapter Built-in Help

The built-in help system in @code{nano} is available by pressing ^G@.
It is fairly self-explanatory.  It documents the various parts of the
editor and the available keystrokes.  Navigation is via the ^Y (Page Up)
and ^V (Page Down) keys.  ^X exits the help system.


@node Feature Toggles
@chapter Feature Toggles

Toggles allow you to change on-the-fly certain aspects of the editor
which would normally be specified via command-line options.  They are
invoked via Meta-key sequences (see @xref{Commands}, for more info).
The following global toggles are available:

@table @code

@item Backup Files Toggle (Meta-B)
toggles the @code{-B} (@code{--backup}) command-line option.

@end table


@node Nanorc Files
@chapter Nanorc Files

The nanorc files contain the default settings for @code{nano}.  They
should be in Unix format, not in DOS or Mac format.  During startup,
@code{nano} will first read the system-wide settings, from /etc/nanorc
(the exact path might be different), and then the user-specific settings,
from @file{~/.nanorc}.

A nanorc file accepts a series of "set" and "unset" commands, which can
be used to configure @code{nano} on startup without using command-line
options.  Additionally, there are some commands to define syntax highlighting
and to rebind keys --- @xref{Syntax Highlighting}, and @xref{Rebinding Keys}.
@code{nano} will read one command per line.

Options in nanorc files take precedence over @code{nano}'s defaults, and
command-line options override nanorc settings.  Also, options that do not
take an argument are unset by default.  So using the @code{unset} command
is only needed when wanting to override a setting of the system's nanorc
file in your own @file{~/.nanorc}.  Options that take an argument cannot
be unset.

Quotes inside string parameters don't have to be escaped with
backslashes.  The last double quote in the string will be treated as its
end.  For example, for the @code{brackets} option, @t{""')>]@}"} will match
@code{"}, @code{'}, @code{)}, @code{>}, @code{]}, and @code{@}}.

@node Settings
@section Settings

The supported settings in a nanorc file are:

@table @code

@item set allow_insecure_backup
When backing up files, allow the backup to succeed even if its
permissions can't be (re)set due to special OS considerations.
You should NOT enable this option unless you are sure you need it.

@item set autoindent
Use auto-indentation.

@item set backup
When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the current
filename suffixed with a tilde (@code{~}).

@item set backupdir "directory"
Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a uniquely
numbered one every time a file is saved --- when backups are enabled
with @code{set backup} or @code{--backup} or @code{-B}.
The uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified directory.

@item set backwards
Do backwards searches by default.

@item set boldtext
Use bold instead of reverse video for the titlebar, statusbar, key combos,
and selected text.  This can be overridden for the first three by setting
the options @code{titlecolor}, @code{statuscolor}, and @code{keycolor}.

@item set brackets "@var{string}"
Set the characters treated as closing brackets when justifying
paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only closing
punctuation (see @code{set punct}), optionally followed by the specified
closing brackets, can end sentences.  The default value is
@t{"')>]@}"}.

@item set casesensitive
Do case-sensitive searches by default.

@item set constantshow
Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.
(The old form of this option, @code{set const}, is deprecated.)

@item set cut
Use cut-to-end-of-line by default, instead of cutting the whole line.

@item set fill @var{number}
Hard-wrap lines at column number @var{number}.  If @var{number} is 0 or less,
the maximum line length will be the screen width less @var{number} columns.
The default value is @t{-8}.

@item set functioncolor @var{fgcolor},@var{bgcolor}
Specify the color combination to use for the function descriptions
in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.
See @code{set titlecolor} for more details.

@item set historylog
Enable the use of @file{~/.nano/search_history} for saving and reading
search/replace strings.

@item set justifytrim
When justifying text, trailing whitespace will automatically be removed.

@item set keycolor @var{fgcolor},@var{bgcolor}
Specify the color combination to use for the shortcut key combos
in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.
See @code{set titlecolor} for more details.

@item set linenumbers
Display line numbers to the left of the text area.

@item set locking
Enable vim-style lock-files for when editing files.

@item set matchbrackets "@var{string}"
Set the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
searches.  This may not include blank characters.  The opening set must
come before the closing set, and the two sets must be in the same order.
The default value is @t{"(<[@{)>]@}"}.

@item set morespace
Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.

@item set mouse
Enable mouse support, so that mouse clicks can be used to place the
cursor, set the mark (with a double click), or execute shortcuts.

@item set multibuffer
When reading in a file with ^R, insert it into a new buffer by default.

@item set noconvert
Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format.

@item set nohelp
Don't display the help lists at the bottom of the screen.

@item set nopauses
Don't pause between warnings at startup.  This means that only
the last one will be visible (when there are multiple ones).

@item set nonewlines
Don't add newlines to the ends of files.

@item set nowrap
Don't hard-wrap text at all.

@item set numbercolor @var{fgcolor},@var{bgcolor}
Specify the color combination to use for line numbers.
See @code{set titlecolor} for more details.

@item set operatingdir "directory"
@code{nano} will only read and write files inside "directory" and its
subdirectories.  Also, the current directory is changed to here, so
files are inserted from this directory.  By default, the operating
directory feature is turned off.

@item set positionlog
Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions.
The cursor position is remembered for the 200 most-recently edited files.
(The old form of this option, @code{set poslog}, is deprecated.)

@item set preserve
Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).

@item set punct "@var{string}"
Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying
paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only the
specified closing punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets
(see @code{set brackets}), can end sentences.
The default value is @t{"!.?"}.

@item set quickblank
Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear after 1
keystroke instead of 25.

@item set quiet
When set, @code{nano} will not report errors in the nanorc file nor ask them
to be acknowledged by pressing Enter at startup.  If this option is used, it
should be placed at the top of the file to be fully effective.

@item set quotestr "@var{string}"
The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.  This
is an extended regular expression if your system supports them,
otherwise a literal string.  The default value is
@t{"^([ \\t]*[#:>\\|@}])+"} if you have extended regular expression
support, and @t{"> "} otherwise.
Note that @code{\t} stands for a literal Tab character.

@item set rebinddelete
Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and Delete
work properly.  You should only need to use this option if Backspace
acts like Delete on your system.

@item set rebindkeypad
Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.  You
should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse support
won't work properly with this option enabled.

@item set regexp
Do extended regular expression searches by default.

@item set showcursor
Put the cursor on the highlighted item in the file browser, to aid
braille users.

@item set smarthome
Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will
jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the cursor is
already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the
line.

@item set smooth
Use smooth scrolling by default.

@item set softwrap
Enable soft line wrapping for easier viewing of very long lines.

@item set speller "spellprog"
Use spelling checker "spellprog" instead of the built-in one, which
calls "spell".

@item set statuscolor @var{fgcolor},@var{bgcolor}
Specify the color combination to use for the statusbar.
See @code{set titlecolor} for more details.

@item set suspend
Allow @code{nano} to be suspended.

@item set tabsize @var{number}
Use a tab size of @var{number} columns.  The value of @var{number} must be
greater than 0.  The default value is @t{8}.

@item set tabstospaces
Convert typed tabs to spaces.

@item set tempfile
Save automatically on exit, don't prompt.

@item set titlecolor @var{fgcolor},@var{bgcolor}
Specify the color combination to use for the titlebar.
Valid color names for foreground and background are:
white, black, blue, green, red, cyan, yellow, and magenta.
The name of the foreground color may be prefixed with 'bright'.
And either @var{fgcolor} or @var{,bgcolor} may be left out.

@item set unix
Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano's
default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.
(This option has no effect when you also use @code{set noconvert}.)

@item set view
Disallow file modification.

@anchor{Whitespace}
@item set whitespace "@var{string}"
Set the two characters used to indicate the presence of tabs and
spaces.  They must be single-column characters.  The default pair
for a UTF-8 locale is @t{"»·"}, and for other locales @t{">."}.

@item set wordbounds
Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
characters as part of a word.

@item set wordchars "@var{string}"
Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric ones)
should be considered as parts of words.  This overrides the option
@code{wordbounds}.

@end table

@node Syntax Highlighting
@section Syntax Highlighting

Coloring the different syntactic elements of a file
is done via regular expressions (see the @code{color} command below).
This is inherently imperfect, because regular expressions are not
powerful enough to fully parse a file.  Nevertheless, regular
expressions can do a lot and are easy to make, so they are a
good fit for a small editor like @code{nano}.

A separate syntax can be defined for each kind of file
via the following commands in a nanorc file:

@table @code

@item syntax "str" ["fileregex" @dots{}]
Defines a syntax named "str" which can be activated via the @code{-Y/--syntax}
command-line option, or will be automatically activated if the current
filename matches the extended regular expression "fileregex".  All
subsequent @code{color}, @code{icolor}, @code{header} and other such
statements will apply to this "str" syntax until a new @code{syntax}
command is encountered.

The "none" syntax is reserved; specifying it on the command line is the
same as not having a syntax at all.  The "default" syntax is special: it
takes no "fileregex", and applies to files that don't match any
syntax's "fileregex".

@item linter program [arg @dots{}]
Use the given program to do a syntax check on the current file
(this overrides the speller function when defined).

@item formatter program [arg @dots{}]
Use the given program to automatically reformat text.
Useful in certain programming languages (e.g.@: Go).

@item header "regex" @dots{}
Add one or more regexes which will
be compared against the very first line of the file to be edited,
to determine whether this syntax should be used for that file.

@item magic "regex" @dots{}
Add one or more regexes which will be
compared against the result of querying the magic database about the file
to be edited, to determine whether this syntax should be used for that
file.  This functionality only works when libmagic is installed on the
system and will be silently ignored otherwise.

@item comment "string"
Use the given string for commenting and uncommenting lines.  A vertical bar or
pipe character (|) designates bracket-style comments; for example, "/*|*/" for
CSS files.  The characters before the pipe are prepended to the line and the
characters after the pipe are appended at the end of the line.  If no pipe
character is present, the entire string is prepended; for example, "#" for
Python files.  If empty double quotes are specified, the comment/uncomment
functions are disabled; for example, "" for JSON.  Double quotes or backslashes
may be escaped with a backslash; for example, ".\\"" for man page source.

@item color fgcolor,bgcolor "regex" @dots{}
Display all pieces of text that match the
extended regular expression "regex" with foreground color "fgcolor" and
background color "bgcolor", at least one of which must be specified.
Valid colors for foreground and background are: white, black, red,
blue, green, yellow, magenta, and cyan.  You may use the prefix "bright"
to get a stronger color highlight for the foreground.  If your
terminal supports transparency, not specifying a "bgcolor" tells @code{nano}
to attempt to use a transparent background.

@item icolor fgcolor,bgcolor "regex" @dots{}
Same as above, except that the text matching is case insensitive.

@item color fgcolor,bgcolor start="sr" end="er"
Display all pieces of text whose start matches extended regular expression
"sr" and whose end matches extended regular expression "er" with foreground
color "fgcolor" and background color "bgcolor", at least one of which
must be specified.  This means that, after an initial instance of "sr",
all text will be highlighted until the first instance of "er".
This allows syntax highlighting to span multiple lines.

@item icolor fgcolor,bgcolor start="sr" end="er"
Same as above, except that the text matching is case insensitive.

@item include "syntaxfile"
Read in self-contained color syntaxes from "syntaxfile".  Note that
"syntaxfile" may contain only the above commands, from @code{syntax}
to @code{icolor}.

@item extendsyntax str directive [arg @dots{}]
Extend the syntax previously defined as str to include new information.
This allows you to add a new @code{color}, @code{icolor}, @code{header},
@code{magic}, @code{comment}, @code{linter}, or @code{formatter} directive to an already
defined syntax --- useful when you want to slightly improve a syntax defined
in one of the system-installed files (which are normally not writable).

Key bindings can be changed via the following two commands in a
nanorc file:

@node The File Browser
@chapter The File Browser

When reading or writing files, pressing ^T will invoke the file browser.
Here, one can navigate directories in a graphical manner in order to
find the desired file.

Basic movement in the file browser is accomplished with the arrow keys,
page up, and page down.  More advanced movement is accomplished by
searching via ^W (or 'w') and changing directories via ^_ (or 'g').  The
behavior of the Enter (or 's') key varies by what is currently selected.
If the currently selected object is a directory, the file browser will
enter and display the contents of the directory.  If the object is a
file, this filename and path are copied to the statusbar, and the file
browser exits.


@node Pico Compatibility
@chapter Pico Compatibility

@code{nano} attempts to emulate Pico as closely as possible, but there
are some differences between the editors:

@table @code

@item Interactive Replace
Instead of allowing you to replace either just one occurrence of a search
string or all of them, @code{nano}'s replace function is interactive: it
will pause at each found search string and query whether to replace this
instance.  You can then choose Yes, or No (skip this one), or All (don't
ask any more), or Cancel (stop with replacing).

@item Search and Replace History
When the option @code{-H} or @code{--historylog} is given (or set in
the .nanorc file), text entered as search or replace strings is stored.
These strings can be accessed with the up/down arrow keys, or you can
type the first few characters and then use Tab to cycle through the
matching strings.  A retrieved string can subsequently be edited.

@item Position History
When the option @code{-P} or @code{--positionlog} is given (or set in
the .nanorc file), @code{nano} will store the position of the cursor
when you close a file, and will place the cursor in that position
again when you later reopen the file.

@item Writing Selected Text to Files
When using the Write-Out key (^O), text that has been selected using the
marking key (^^) can not just be written out to a new (or existing) file,
it can also be appended or prepended to an existing file.

@item Reading Text from a Command
When using the Read-File key (^R), @code{nano} can not just read a file,
it can also read the output of a command to be run (^X).

@item File Browser
In the file browser, @code{nano} does not implement the Add, Copy,
Rename, and Delete commands that Pico provides.  In @code{nano} the
browser is just a file browser, not a file manager.

@item Toggles
Many options which alter the functionality of the program can be
"toggled" on or off using Meta key sequences, meaning the program does
not have to be restarted to turn a particular feature on or off.
See the internal help function (^G) for a list of features that
can be toggled.  Or see @xref{Feature Toggles} instead.

@item Current Cursor Position
The output of the "Display Cursor Position" command (^C) displays
not only the current line and character position of the cursor,
but also (between the two) the current column position.

@item Spell Checking
In the internal spell checker misspelled words are sorted alphabetically
and trimmed for uniqueness, such that the words 'apple' and 'Apple' will
be prompted for correction separately.

@end table


@node Building and Configure Options
@chapter Building and Configure Options

Building @code{nano} from source is fairly straightforward if you are
familiar with compiling programs with autoconf support:

@itemize @bullet
@item tar xvfz nano-x.y.z.tar.gz (where x.y.z is the version of
@code{nano})
@item cd nano-x.y.z/
@item ./configure
@item make
@item make install
@end itemize

The possible options to @code{./configure} are:

@table @code

@item --disable-browser
Disable the mini file browser when reading or writing files.

@item --disable-color
Disable support for the syntax coloring of files.  This also eliminates
the @code{-Y} command-line option, which chooses a specific syntax.

@item --disable-extra
Disable extra features.  At the moment, this is just easter-egg-type
stuff.

@item --disable-help
Disable the help function.  Doing this makes the binary much smaller,
but makes it difficult for new users to learn more than very basic
things about using the editor.

@item --disable-histories
Disable the code for the handling of the history files: the search and
replace strings that were used, and the cursor position at which each
file was closed.  This also eliminates the @code{-H} and @code{-P}
command-line options, which switch on the logging of search/replace
strings and cursor positions.

@item --disable-justify
Disable the justify and unjustify functions.

@item --disable-libmagic
Disable the use of the library of magic-number tests (for determining
the file type and thus which syntax to use for colouring --- often the
tests on filename extension and header line will be enough).

@item --disable-mouse
Disable all mouse functionality.  This also eliminates the @code{-m}
command-line option, which enables the mouse functionality.

@item --disable-multibuffer
Disable support for opening multiple files at a time and switching
between them on the fly.  This also eliminates the @code{-F} command-line
option, which causes a file to be read into a separate buffer by default.

@item --disable-nanorc
Disable support for reading the nanorc files at startup.  With such
support, you can store custom settings in a system-wide and a per-user
nanorc file rather than having to pass command-line options to get
the desired behavior.  See @xref{Nanorc Files}, for more info.
Disabling this also eliminates the @code{-I} and @code{-q} command-line
options; the first inhibits the reading of nanorcfiles, and the second
suppresses warnings about errors in those files.

@item --disable-operatingdir
Disable setting the operating directory.  This also eliminates the @code{-o}
command-line option, which sets the operating directory.

@item --disable-speller
Disable use of the spell checker.  This also eliminates the @code{-s}
command-line option, which allows specifying an alternate spell checker.

@item --disable-tabcomp
Disable tab completion (when nano asks for a filename or a search string).

@item --disable-wordcomp
Disable word completion.

@item --disable-wrapping
Disable all hard-wrapping of overlong lines.  This also eliminates the
@code{-w} command-line option, which switches long-line wrapping off.

@item --enable-tiny
This option implies all of the above.  It also disables some other
internals of the editor, like the marking code, the cut-to-end-of-line
code, and the function toggles.  By using the enabling
counterpart of the above options together with @code{--enable-tiny},
specific features can be switched back on --- but a few cannot.

@item --enable-debug
Enable support for runtime debug output.  This can get pretty messy, so
chances are you only want this feature when you're working on the nano source.

@item --disable-nls
Disables Native Language support.  This will disable the use of any
available GNU @code{nano} translations.

@item --disable-wrapping-as-root
Disable hard-wrapping of overlong lines by default when @code{nano}
is run as root.

@item --enable-utf8
Enable support for reading and writing Unicode files.  This will require
either a wide version of curses, or a UTF-8-enabled version of Slang.

@item --disable-utf8
Disable support for reading and writing Unicode files.  Normally the
configure script auto-detects whether to enable UTF-8 support or not.
You can use this or the previous option to override that detection.

@item --enable-altrcname=@var{name}
Use the file with the given @var{name} (in the user's home directory)
as nano's settings file, instead of the default @code{.nanorc}.

@item --with-slang
Compile @code{nano} against Slang instead of against ncurses or other
curses libraries.

@end table
