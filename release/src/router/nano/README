		GNU nano -- an enhanced clone of the Pico text editor

Overview

	The nano project was started because of a few "problems" with the
	wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor.

	First and foremost was its license: the Pine suite does not use
	the GPL or a GPL-friendly license, and has unclear restrictions on
	redistribution.  Because of this, Pine and Pico are not included
	with many GNU/Linux distributions.  Also, other features (like
	go-to-line-number or search-and-replace) were unavailable until
	recently or require a command-line flag.  Yuck.

	nano aims to solve these problems by emulating the functionality of
	Pico as closely as possible while addressing the problems above and
	providing other extra functionality.

	The nano editor is an official GNU package.  For more information on
	GNU and the Free Software Foundation, please see http://www.gnu.org/.

How to compile and install nano

	Download the nano source code, then:

	tar xvzf nano-x.y.z.tar.gz
	cd nano-x.y.z
	./configure
	make
	make install

	It's that simple.  Use --prefix with configure to override the
	default installation directory of /usr/local.

	If you haven't configured with the --disable-nanorc option, after
	installation you may want to copy the doc/sample.nanorc file to
	your home directory, rename it to ".nanorc", and then edit it
	according to your taste.

Mailing Lists

	There are three nano-related mailing-lists.

	+ info-nano@gnu.org is a very low traffic list used to announce
	  new nano versions or other important info about the project.
	+ help-nano@gnu.org is for those seeking to get help without
	  wanting to hear about the technical details of its development.
	+ nano-devel@gnu.org is the list used by the people that make nano
	  and a general development discussion list, with moderate traffic.

	To subscribe, send email to <name>-request@gnu.org with a subject
	of "subscribe", where <name> is the list you want to subscribe to.

Bug Reports

	To report a bug, please file a description of the problem on nano's
	bug tracker (https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano -- hover on
	"Bugs", then click "Submit new").  The issue may have already been
	reported, so please look first.

Current Status

	GNU nano has reached its seventh milestone, 2.6.x.  Since 2.5.0, it
	is a "rolling" release: bug fixing and development go hand in hand.
