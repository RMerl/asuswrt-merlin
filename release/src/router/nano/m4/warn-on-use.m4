# gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE(INCLUDES, NAMES)
# ---------------------------------------
# For each whitespace-separated element in the list of NAMES, define
# HAVE_RAW_DECL_name if the function has a declaration among INCLUDES
# even after being undefined as a macro.
#
# See warn-on-use.h for some hints on how to poison function names, as
# well as ideas on poisoning global variables and macros.  NAMES may
# include global variables, but remember that only functions work with
# _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  Typically, INCLUDES only needs to list a single
# header, but if the replacement header pulls in other headers because
# some systems declare functions in the wrong header, then INCLUDES
# should do likewise.
#
# It is generally safe to assume declarations for functions declared
# in the intersection of C89 and C11 (such as printf) without
# needing gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE.
