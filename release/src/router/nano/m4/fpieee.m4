dnl IEEE 754 standardized three items:
dnl - The formats of single-float and double-float - nowadays commonly
dnl   available as 'float' and 'double' in C and C++.
dnl   No autoconf test needed.
dnl - The overflow and division by zero behaviour: The result are values
dnl   'Â±Inf' and 'NaN', rather than exceptions as it was before.
dnl   This file provides an autoconf macro for ensuring this behaviour of
dnl   floating-point operations.
dnl - A set of conditions (overflow, underflow, inexact, etc.) which can
dnl   be configured to trigger an exception.
dnl   This cannot be done in a portable way: it depends on the compiler,
dnl   libc, kernel, and CPU.  No autoconf macro is provided for this.

dnl Ensure non-trapping behaviour of floating-point overflow and
dnl floating-point division by zero.
dnl (For integer overflow, see gcc's -ftrapv option; for integer division by
dnl zero, see the autoconf macro in intdiv0.m4.)
