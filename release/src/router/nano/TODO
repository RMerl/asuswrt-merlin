A list of desired features
--------------------------

Somewhat urgent:
- Make undo/redo work also for justifying and indenting.
- Allow text searches in the help viewer.
  See https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?28994.
- Detect when text is being pasted, so that we can handle it faster.
  See https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?40060.
- Allow to define and execute a macro: a stored sequence of keystrokes.
  See https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?50314.
- Allow color syntaxes to apply to more than just color, so that we can
  e.g. specify a different alternate spell checker depending on which
  file type we have open.
- Allow piping marked text to an external command and replacing it with
  the command's output -- that is: generalize the spell-check flow.
  See also https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?28993.

Vague musings:
- FriBidi support?
- Allow setting marks (saved positions, not to be confused with the
  mark set via Ctrl-^) at various lines and/or columns in the buffer,
  and allow movement between them with a single keystroke?
- Make matching bracket searches sophisticated enough to skip over
  brackets inside comments?
- Allow indentation of marked text by spaces as well as tabs?
- Allow indentation to add just enough columns to reach the nearest
  multiple of tabsize, rather than always adding tabsize columns?

For version 2.4:
- Handle window resizes better.  After we've resized, we should stay
  wherever we were before we resized, as Pico does. [DONE]
- Allow even better file-type detection than we have currently, e.g.
  through libmagic. [DONE]
- Compatibility with vim status files to let other editors know we're
  in a file. [DONE]

For version 2.2:
- Rebindable keys? [DONE]
- Undo/Redo keys (M-U and M-E)? [DONE]
- Fix problems with color syntaxes highlighting lines too aggressively. [DONE]
- Allow nano to work like a pager (reading from stdin). [DONE]
- Allow color syntaxes to be selected based on more than just filename
  extension. [DONE]
- Allow soft wrapping as well as hard wrapping? [DONE]

For version 2.0:
- UTF-8 support. [DONE]
- Support for paragraph searches. [DONE]
- Support for justifying the entire file at once. [DONE]
- Support for filename searches in the file browser. [DONE]
- Keystroke to implement "Add next sequence as raw" like vi's ^V. [DONE]
- Spell check selected text only. [DONE]
- Make "To Line" (^W^T) and "Read from Command" (^R^X) reenter their
  parent menu when their keystroke is entered a second time (^W^T^T and
  (^R^X^X) (requires figuring out when to keep cursor position and when
  not to). [DONE]
- Fix resetstatuspos global which we shouldn't have. [DONE]

For version 1.2:
- Single-line scroll up/down? [DONE]
- Color syntax highlighting? (There seems to be a demand for it.) [DONE]
- Support for a .nanorc file. [DONE]
- Backup making (filename~)? [DONE]
- Search/replace string history. [DONE]
- Implement Pico's -j and -g flags, as they are pretty easy to do. [DONE]
- Make mouse support work with clicking on the shortcuts (-m). [DONE]
- Implement -o (--operatingdir, a chroot of sorts). [DONE]
- Allow -r to take a negative argument, meaning right margin instead of
  left (allows resizing that way), formerly -W arg. [DONE]

For version 1.0:
- Implement Spelling. [DONE]
- Implement Help. [DONE]
- Internationalization [In progress, translators welcome!]
- Allow nano to be resized in X. [DONE]
- On PageUp/Down, put the cursor on the first line (like Pico), not the
  center line. [DONE]
- Implement justify function. [DONE]
- Cut to end of line. [DONE]
- Built-in speller command. [DONE]
- Better statusbar interaction (scrolling, tab completion). [DONE]
- Unjustify command (^U after ^J). [DONE]
- Username completion (~user). [DONE]
