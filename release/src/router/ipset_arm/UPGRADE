ipset 6.x, 5.x upgrade notices

- From ipset 5.0-5.3 to 5.4 or above:

  Due to the source code reorganization, some macros were moved to
  the netlink.patch. Therefore when upgrading, you have two choices:

  a. force the application of the new netlink.patch

     kernel-source-dir # patch -p1 -f < ipset-curr-dir/netlink.patch

  b. remove the earlier netlink.patch and apply the new one:

     kernel-source-dir # patch -p1 -R < ipset-before-5.4-dir/netlink.patch
     kernel-source-dir # patch -p1 < ipset-curr-dir/netlink.patch

  You do not need to recompile your kernel.

  Of course the kernel modules in ipset must be compiled and installed.
