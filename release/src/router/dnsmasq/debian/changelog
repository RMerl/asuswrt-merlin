     in /etc/dnsmasq.d
   * Provide a facility in /etc/default/dnsmasq to disable dnsmasq's
     interaction with the resolvconf package. This is needed because
     setting "resolv-file" in /etc/dnsmasq.conf won't override a
     file given on the command line from resolvconf. (closes: #528762)
   * Check for duplicate names/addresses in /etc/ethers. (closes: #523787)
   * Set the system locale in the environment before invoking dnsmasq,
     so that translated messages work, and IDN uses the correct charset.

dnsmasq (2.47-1) unstable; urgency=low

   * New upstream.
   * Handle the "ENABLED" flag in the init script a bit more 
     intelligently. The "stop" and "status" functions continue
     to work even when disabled, but a failed "stop" becomes 
     silent and returns zero exit code.
   * Don't explicitly kill dnsmasq at system shutdown, rely on the 
     sendsigs script instead which is quicker. (closes: #506734)
   * Store the PID-file in /var/run/dnsmasq. This directory is owned by
     user "dnsmasq", so that dnsmasq can delete the PID-file on
     shutdown. This ensures that the the PID-file goes even when dnsmasq 
     is stopped by sendsigs. (closes: #508560) 
   * Bump standards-version to 3.8.0 (no changes required.)
   * /usr/sbin/adduser -> adduser in postinst. Lintian fix.
   * Handle IPv6 addresses in "tentative" state better. (closes: #507646) 
   * Add DBus introspection support. (closes: #508774)
   * Fix Dbus configuration. (closes: #510649)

dnsmasq (2.46-1) unstable; urgency=low

   * New upstream. (closes: #499162) (closes: #499007)
   * Remove from init script start-stop-daemon call to kill
     child processes. This is not needed since dnsmasq is 
     carefully written to kill child processes, and it interacts
     badly with "private" instances of dnsmasq. (closes: #505523)
   * Provide /etc/dnsmasq.d and alter the installed /etc/default/dnsmasq
     so that /etc/dnsmasq.d is read. This provides a drop-directory where
     libvirt can add options to make the system dnsmasq automatically 
     play nice with libvirt's private instances. (closes: #505522)

dnsmasq (2.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

   * Removed reload command from start script and moved force-reload
     to be equivalent to restart. This is needed to be policy compliant

     only the /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf etc. (closes: #244208)

dnsmasq (2.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

   * Added Conflict with pdnsd (closes: #242731).
     Rationale: dnsmasq used to conflict with all the DNS servers
     in Debian, but that was removed because some people wished
     to run with dnsmasq listening on one interface and another DNS
     server listening on another interface. However AFAIK it is not
     possible to make pdnsd listen on a subset of a hosts interfaces,
     so there is no scenario where running pdnsd and dnsmasq on the same
     host would be useful, hence the conflict goes back.
   * Added note about the --bind-interfaces option to
     readme.Debian (closes: #241700)

dnsmasq (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

   * New upstream: This removes the ability to read the 
     the leases file of ISC DHCP and replaces it with a built-in 
     DHCP server. Apologies in advance for breaking backwards 
     compatibilty, but this replaces a bit of a hack (the ISC stuff)
     with a nicely engineered and much more apropriate solution.
     Wearing my upstream-maintainer hat, I want to lose the hack now,
     rather than have to support it into Sarge.
   * New upstream closes some bugs since they become 
     irrelevant. (closes: #197295)
   * Ensure that /var/run and /var/lib/misc exist.
   * Remove sed dependency, which was a mistake.
   * Remove extraneous "build" file. (closes: #226994)

   * Removed conflicts with other dns servers since it is now
     possible to control exactly where dnsmasq listens on multi-homed 
     hosts, making co-existance with another nameserver 
     a viable proposition. (closes #176163)
