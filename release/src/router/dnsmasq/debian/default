# This file has five functions: 
# 1) to completely disable starting dnsmasq, 
# 2) to set DOMAIN_SUFFIX by running `dnsdomainname` 
# 3) to select an alternative config file
#    by setting DNSMASQ_OPTS to --conf-file=<file>
# 4) to tell dnsmasq to read the files in /etc/dnsmasq.d for
#    more configuration variables.
# 5) to stop the resolvconf package from controlling dnsmasq's
#    idea of which upstream nameservers to use.
# For upgraders from very old versions, all the shell variables set 
# here in previous versions are still honored by the init script
# so if you just keep your old version of this file nothing will break.

# By default search this drop directory for configuration options.
# Libvirt leaves a file here to make the system dnsmasq play nice.
# Comment out this line if you don't want this. The dpkg-* are file
# endings which cause dnsmasq to skip that file. This avoids pulling
# in backups made by dpkg.

# If the resolvconf package is installed, dnsmasq will use its output 
# rather than the contents of /etc/resolv.conf to find upstream 
# nameservers. Uncommenting this line inhibits this behaviour.
# Not that including a "resolv-file=<filename>" line in 
# /etc/dnsmasq.conf is not enough to override resolvconf if it is
# installed: the line below must be uncommented.
