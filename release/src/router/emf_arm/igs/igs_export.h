 * Description: This function is called by IGS Common code when it wants
 *              to send a multicast packet on to all the LAN ports. It
 *              allocates the native OS packet buffer, adds mac header and
 *              forwards a copy of frame on to LAN ports.
 *
 * Input:       igs_info - IGS instance information.
 *              ip       - Pointer to the buffer containing the frame to
 *                         send. Frame starts with IP header.
 *              length   - Length of the buffer.
 *              mgrp_ip  - Multicast destination address.
 *
 * Return:      SUCCESS or FAILURE
