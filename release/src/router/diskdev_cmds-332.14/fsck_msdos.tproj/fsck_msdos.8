.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility verifies and repairs
.Tn FAT
file systems (more commonly known
as
.Tn DOS
file systems).
.Pp
The first form of
.Nm
quickly checks the specified file systems to determine whether
they were cleanly unmounted.
.Pp
The second form of
.Nm
preens the specified file systems.
It is normally started by
.Xr fsck 8
run from
.Pa /etc/rc.boot
during automatic reboot, when a FAT file system is detected.
When preening file systems,
.Nm
will fix common inconsistencies non-interactively.  If
more serious problems are found,
.Nm
does not try to fix them, indicates that it was not
successful, and exits.
.Pp
The third form of
.Nm
checks the specified file systems and tries to repair all
detected inconsistencies, requesting confirmation before
making any changes.  The default behavior is to always ask
for confirmation of each change.  Use the -n or -y options
to override this default behavior.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It Fl q
Causes
.Nm
to quickly check whether the volume was unmounted cleanly.
If the volume was unmounted cleanly, then the exit status is 0.
If the volume was not unmounted cleanly, then the exit status
will be non-zero.  In either case, a message is printed to
standard output describing whether the volume was clean or dirty.
.It Fl f
This option is ignored by
.Nm
and is present only for compatibility with programs that
check other file system types for consistency.
.It Fl n
Causes
.Nm
to assume no as the answer to all operator
questions, except
.Dq CONTINUE? .
.It Fl p
Preen the specified file systems.
.It Fl y
Causes
.Nm
to assume yes as the answer to all operator questions.
