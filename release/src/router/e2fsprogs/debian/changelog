e2fsprogs (1.42.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Add warning indicating that the quota and bigalloc features are
    still under development.
  * Added new options to filefrag to be consistent with the version from
    Lustre
  * Optimized e2fsck's CPU utilization
  * Fixed e2fsck so it detects and fixes inconsistencies in the interior
    nodes of an inode's extent tree
  * Fixed a potential memory corruption failure in e2fsck's error path if
    the call to ext2fs_open2() fails.
  * Fixed e2fsck if its logging function is enabled in e2fsck.conf, and
    the resulting file name for the log file is longer than 100 bytes,
    that it properly handles this situation instead of crashing.
  * E2fsck will now report the amount of memory that it attempted to
    allocate when a memory allocation request fails, to make it easier to
    track down the problem.
  * Fixed a bug in resize2fs which could cause severe file system
    corruption when growing an ext4 file system which was formatted with
    fewer-than-normal reserved gdt blocks
  * Fixed resize2fs to be able to handle off-line resizes of file
    systems with the flex_bg feature and without any reserved gdt
    blocks or if the file system did not have the resize_inode feature
  * Further optimize resize2fs so it doesn't use quite as much CPU when
    resizing very large file systems.
  * Fixed 32-bit overflow bugs which could cause resize2fs to fail and
    possibly corrupt the file system while resizing 64-bit file systems.
  * Fixed a big which could cause resize2fs to corrupt bigalloc file systems.
  * Fix a crash while mke2fs is parsing "-E resize=NNN" with the 64bit
    file system feature enabled
  * Added better error checking to mke2fs to check for invalid
    parameters when creating bigalloc file system.
  * When creating bigalloc filesystems, the -g option to mke2fs will now
    specify the number of clusters per block group.
  * Added the "symlink", "zap_block", "block_dump", and "extent_open"
    commands to debugfs
  * Fixed debugfs's htree command so that all its messages are sent
    through the pager.
  * Fixed debugfs's dump_file and cat functions so they work correctly
    on file systems with a block size greater than 8k.
  * Fixed mke2fs's handling of the mmp_update_interval option
  * Fixed e2freefrag so it works on 64-bit file systems, and so it uses
    much less memory.
  * E2image can now include all data blocks in the e2image output
    file when the user specifies the -a option.
  * Fixed debugfs's mknod command so that it updates the block group
    statistics
  * Document the bigalloc feature in the mke2fs man page.
    (Closes: #669730)
  * Update Czech, Dutch, French, German, Polish, Sweedish, and
    Vietnamese translations

e2fsprogs (1.42.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Fix build dependencies to avoid requiring dc, and to allow
    cross-building to work (Closes: #677497)
  * Updated/fixed various man pages
  * Mke2fs will now update its progress indicators at most once a second
    to avoid overwhelming serial consoles.
  * Resize2fs will support lazy_itable_init, speeding up off-line growth
    of uninit_bg file systems.
  * Resize2fs now supports on-line resizing 64-bit file systems beyond
    16TB.  A number of bugs in resize2fs which prevented this have been
    fixed.
  * Resize2fs now correctly handles resizing 32-bit file systems to 16TB.
  * Fixed a potential segfault in e2fsck when there is an I/O error
    while reading the superblock.

e2fsprogs (1.42.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Mark the e2fsprogs package as Multi-Arch: foreign, so if a package
    foo:i386 depends on e2fsprogs and is installed on an amd64 system,
    the native e2fsprogs will satisfy the dependency.  (Closes: #678395)
  * Fix a fd leak which could cause logsave (and hence a boot-time rc
    init script) to hang (Closes: #682592)
  * Fix a problem if e2fsck where if the root file system is mounted
    read-only, e2fsck would not clear an error indication in the journal
    superblock.  Combined with a kernel bug, this would cause the e2fsck
    to check the file system after every single boot
  * Fixed filefrag so it would not seg fault on virtual filesystems such
    as /proc: e.g., "filefrag /proc/partitions"
  * Fix filefrag so that it correctly reports the number of extents
  * Fixed a bug which caused "mke2fs -N 256 -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 256m"
    to write blocks out until /tmp filled
  * Fixed a bug in how e2fsck would uniquify directory entry names
  * Change e2fsck so it will allow file systems mounted read-only to be
    checked with the -f option.
  * Fix e2fsck so that the file system is marked as containing an
    error if the user chooses not to fix the quota usage information.
  * Fix tune2fs so that it correctly removes the quota feature when
    the last quota inode is removed.
  * Fix tune2fs so that after removing a quota inode, the block bitmap
    is updated; otherwise, e2fsck would complain after running 'tune2fs
    -O ^quota <dev>'.
  * Fix tune2fs so that when converting a file system from using legacy
    quota files to the new quota file system feature with hidden quota
    files, the accounting for these files is handled correctly so that
    e2fsck doesn't complain.
  * The e4defrag program now allows device symlinks, such as
    /dev/mapper/testvg-testlv, instead of insisting on less
    human-friendly names such as /dev/dm-2
  * Updated/fixed various man pages  (Closes: #680114)

  * New upstream version
  * Fix bugs on 32-bit systems which could corrupt > 16TB file systems
  * Quiet complaints in e2fsck when the total free blocks or inodes are
    incorrect in the superblock after an system crash, since we don't
    update nor depend on the superblock summaries at each commit boundary
  * Fixed support for (hidden) quota files built into ext4; in
    particular, don't rewrite the quota inode unless the quotas are
    inconsistent

e2fsprogs (1.42.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Fixed various man pages (Closes: #665427)
  * Speed up resize2fs for large file systems (Closes: #663237)
  * Be less strict about the EXT4_EOFBLOCKS_FL flag (which will
    eventually be going away in the ext4 file system format)
  * Teach mke2fs to use direct I/O if the -D option is given
  * Print errors returned by ext2fs_open2() and ext2fs_check_desc() so
    we can more easily diagnose memory allocation failures caused by
    insufficient memory and abort on memory allocation failures
  * E2fsck can now write log files containing the details of the
    problems that were found and fixed directly.
  * E2fsck can now limit the number of messages issued and printed on
    the console
  * The dumpe2fs, debugfs, and tune2fs now use rbtree bitmaps, which
    cause them to use much less memory for large file systems.
  * E2fsck will now check for zero-length extents, since older kernels will
    OOPS if they comes across one
  * Fix e2fsck's discard behaviour so it does not discard too many
    blocks, and it will not use discard if the device advertises
    that discard does not persistently zero data.  Also, if e2fsck is
    run in read-only mode, do not try to discard data.
  * Fix mke2fs -S so it does not corrupt the first block group's
    information.
  * Add pointer for e2fsprogs-udeb to libcomerr2.shlibs (Closes: #665885)

  * Debugfs's ncheck command is now much more useful when used to
    diagnose badly corrupted file system.  Added a new -c option.
  * Fixed bug in e2image which could cause it to fail to set i_size
    correctly if the last hole in the file is an exact multiple of a
    megabyte.
  * Fixed a bug with resize2fs where for 1k and 2k file systems, the
    minimum file size used for resize2fs -M could be a block too small.

      without an explanation of what was fixed.
  * E2fsck will no longer attempt to clone an extended attribute block
      in pass1b handling if the file system does not support extended
      attributes.
  * E2fsck will be more careful accidentally asking the user to continue
      if the file system is mounted, so that an escape sequence won't
      cause a false positive.  (Closes: #619859)
  * E2fsck now uses less cpu time in pass 5
  * E2fsck will no longer segault when a corrupted file system has a bad
    extent, and removing it leads to a block needing to be deallocated.

       searched-for block as an extended attribute block.
   * Debugfs now has a new "punch" command which remove blocks from the
       middle of an inode.
   * The badblocks program now correctly recovers from I/O errors when
       direct I/O is being used.  The badblocks command now also
       supports a -B option which forces the use of buffered I/O, and
       the -v option will provide a more detailed breakdown of read,
       write, and failed comparison errors.

    is device is not found
  * The resize2fs program will refuse to print the minimum size needed
    for a file system if it is not clean.
  * E2fsck now tests for extents that begin at physical block 0 and
    rejects them as invalid.
  * Fixed a bug in e2fsck which could cause it to crash when trying to
    remove an invalid extent and the block bitmaps hadn't yet been loaded.
  * E2fsck will now completely skip time-based checks if the system
    clock looks insane or if the broken_system_clock option is set
    in /etc/e2fsck.conf.  (Closes: #549861, #540152)
  * Fixed a bug in e2fsck which caused e2fsck to complain about i_blocks
    with a 4T file created using posix_fallocate()
  * E2fsck will now correctly mark a sparse journal as invalid and will
    delete and recreate the journal to address the problem.
  * Fixed e2fsck not to ask permission from the user to abort if it's
    going to abort regardless of what the user is going to say...
  * E2fsck can now continue even if it fails to recreate the resize inode
  * E2fsck will now avoid removing directory entries for inods found in
    the unused region of the inode table until after it restarts the fs
    check to avoid removing valid data.
  * E2fsck will now longer try to set the block group checksums if it
    is interrupted.
  * Mke2fs will check both the physical and logical blocksizes of a
    device to better support 4k sector drives.
  * Mke2fs will accept the valid (but rarely useful) flex_bg size of 1
  * E2fsck will check for cases where the EOFBLOCKS_FL is set whe nit is
    not needed, and offer to clear it.

  * New upstream release
  * Add Heimdal function com_right_r() to libcom_err (Closes: #558910)
  * Allow e2fsck to run even if the physical device has more than 2**32 blocks
  * Debugfs's "logdump -b <blk>" now properly shows the allocation status
    of the block <blk>.  (Closes: #564084)
  * Make e2fsck's "the filesystem is mounted" message is now more scary
    to hopefully dissuade users from thinking, "surely that message
    doesn't apply to *me*"  :-(
  * e2fsck -n will now always open the file system read-only.   We now
    disallow certain combination of options which previously were manual
    exceptions; this is bad because it causes users to think they are
    smarter than they really are.   So "-n -c", "-n -l", "-n -L", and
    "-n -D" are no longer supported.
  * If the partition is badly aligned, have mke2fs just print a warning
    message and continue.  Previously mke2fs would ask to confirm, and
    this broke distro installation scripts.
  * Fix a bug in libext2fs caused the creation of very large journals
    for ext4 to be _very_ slow.
  * E2fsck now understands the EOFBLOCKS_FL flag which will be used in
    2.6.34 kernels to make e2fsck not complain about blocks deliberately
    fallocated() beyond an inode's i_size.
  * Fix a bug in e2fsck which could cause e2fsck -D to corrupt
    non-indexed directories.  (Closes: #572453)
  * debian/rules: can be compiled statically with stack protector now.

  * Fix some big-endian bugs in e2fsck and libext2fs
  * Teach e2fsck to detect and fix sparse extent-mapped directories
  * Fix filefrag from core dumping on file systems with 8k block sizes
  * E2fsck was depending on i_size to be correct to detect and fix
    certain directory problems before actually fixing the
    directory's i_size.  This caused certain rare corruptions to
    require two runs of e2fsck to address.
  * Update Czech, Indonesian, Polish and Vietnamese translations
    (from the Translation Project)
  * Fix e2fsck to find and correct duplicate directory entries in
    non-indexed directories.
  * Add support for calling BLKDISCARD to mke2fs.
  * Enhance libext2fs so it works around bug in Linux version 2.6.19
    and earlier where the /proc/swaps file was missing the header on
    the first line.
  * Fix resize2fs so it works correctly on file systems with external journals
  * Fix libss so that it does not seg fault when using a readline
    library which does not supply a readline_shutdown() function.
  * Add a pre-depends for util-linux-ng (Closes: #551795)
  * Update and clarify various man pages.
  * Corrected dumpe2fs's usage message
  * Teach libext2fs to ignore the high 32 bits of the i_blocks field
    when huge_file file system feature is set, but the inode does not
    have the HUGE_FILE_FL flag set.
  * Change e2fsck to accept superblock times to be fudged by up to 24
    hours by default.  Most distributions have fixed their init scripts,
    but apparently now they have buggy virtualization scripts.  :-(  I
    give up, too many buggy user space set ups out there.  (Closes: #557636)
  * Fix e2fsck to correctly print > 32-bit i_blocks numbers in problem reports
  * Improve e2fsck so it prints "Illegal indirect block" instead of
    "Illegal block #-1"

    it to populate the superblock stride and stripe sizes and warn if
    the block device is misaligned
  * Fix a file descriptor leak in debugfs when sourcing a command file
  * Fix a file descriptor leak in fsck
  * Round up the bitmap size to prevent spurious segmentation faults on
    BSD platforms.
  * Fix resize2fs to correctly calculate the minimum size needed, when
    flex_bg is enabled, to prevent resize2fs -M from failing.
  * Dumpe2fs now displays more information about the contents of the journal
  * Make sure the libblkid1 and libblkid1-dbg packags have changelogs
  * On low memory systems, e2fsck can print some very scary looking
    error messages.  Clean up them up to avoid user panic.  (Closes: #509529)
  * Enhance blkid to support .ko.gz files in the modules.dep parser
  * Fix tune2fs -j for mounted exted-enabled file systems
  * Use the feature name "extent" instead of "extents" in mke2fs.conf.
    Both work, but the latter is what is documented in the man page.

    filesystems formatted for RAID arrays, and ENOSPC errors
  * Require the user to only answer one question instead of multiple
    ones for multiple bad block group checksums, or when an inode
    table needs to be moved.
  * Fix e2fsck to handle moving inode tables in FLEX_BG filesystems more
    gracefully by looking in the entire flex_bg for space, instead of
    just in the block group; if that doesn't work, try looking for
    space in the entire filesystem.
  * Fix the filefrag code to avoid printing the extent header if it
    needs to fallback to using the FIBMAP ioctl.
  * Fix filefrag to print the correct number of extents for zero-length
    files when using FIBMAP.  (Closes: #540376)
  * Add a filefrag -B option to make it easier to debug the FIBMAP
    support.
  * Allow e2fsprogs programs to allocate from uninitalized block groups.
  * Add a new program, e2freefrag, which displays information about the
    free space fragmentation in an ext2/3/4 filesystem.
  * E2fsck will now print much fuller information when the last mount
    time or last written time is in the future, since most people can't
    seem to believe their distribution has buggy init scripts, or they
    have a failed CMOS/RTS clock battery.
  * Update French, Polish, Czech, and Sweedish translation from the
    Translation Project.
  * Enhance debugfs's 'stat' command to print basic extent information
    for extent-mapped inodes, and add a new command, 'dump_extents'
    which prints detailed information about an inode's extent tree.

    bytes when operating on extents; potentially corrupting filesystems.
  * The logsave program will now filter out the ^A and ^B characters when

  * Change badblocks to allow block sizes larger than 4k.
  * Fix libext2fs to properly initialize i_extra_size when creating the

  * Fix blkid to deal with an ext3 filesystem with the test_fs flag
  * Fix debugfs's ncheck output to suppress extra characters at the end

  * Update the Catalan translation
  * Filter out linux-vdso.so lines when determining the library

  * E2fsck now distinguishes between fragmented directories and
    fragmented files in verbose mode statistics and in the fragcheck
    report.
  * Avoid double-counting non-contiguous extent-based inodes in the
    verbose mode statistics.
  * E2fsck now leaves slack space when repacking directories so that a
    few new directory entries won't cause leaf nodes to become split
    right away.
  * E2fsck was previously not handling the case of a corrupted interior
    node in the extent tree, and would crash in that case.  It now will
    handle this and related failures robustly.
  * E2fsck problem descriptions involving the journal are no longer
    referred to as "ext3" problems, since ext4 filesystems also have
    journals.
  * Fix a long-standing bug in e2fsck which would cause it to crash when
    replying journals for filesystems with block sizes greater than 8k.
  * Fix a regression in debugfs's logdump command so it works for
    filesystems with 32-bit block numbers.  This was accidentally broken
    when the header files were changed to support the 64-bit block numbers.
  * Fix resize2fs for ext4 filesystems.  Some blocks that that need moving
    when shrinking filesystems with uninit_bg feature would not be
    moved.  In addition, blocks and inode table blocks were not being
    correctly freed when shrinking filesystems with the flex_bg feable,
    which caused resize2fs -M to fail.  Finally, when blocks are moved,
    make sure the uninitialized flag in extents is preserved.
  * Add mkfs.ext4 symlink to the e2fsprogs-udeb package (Closes: #511207)
  * Resize2fs now reserves some extra block when calculating the minimum
    size to shrink the filesystem in case some extent allocation trees
  * Add a "set -e" to uuid-runtime's prerm script to make Lintian happy
  * The blkid library will now recognize btrfs filesystems and swap
    devices currently used by user-level software suspend.
  * tune2fs will not allow changing the inode size for filesystems that
    have the flex_bg feature enabled, since the code currently assumes
    the each block group's portion inode table is located in its own
    block group.
  * Fix tune2fs -I so it won't corrupt ext3/ext4 filesystem configured
    for RAID storage devices.
  * Mke2fs now understands a -U option which allows the UUID to be
    specified for the new filesystem.
  * Mke2fs will now treat devices with exactly 16TB as if they have 16TB
    minus one block, since many users expect ext4 to support 16TB
    devices, and the true maximum size is 16TB-1.
  * E2fsck will now flag filesystems that have an insane s_first_ino
    field in their superblock.

    giving a number of errors.
  * Add support for ext4 filesystem features.  (Closes: #388452, #425477)
  * Tune2fs can migrate a filesystem from using 128 byte inodes to

    failures.
  * This version of e2fsprogs removes support for legacy big-endian
    filesystems and for MASIX filesystems.

e2fsprogs (1.40.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Mke2fs will now create new filesystems with 256 byte inodes and the
      ext_attr feature flag by default.  This allows for much better
      future compatibity with ext4 and speeds up extended attributes
      even on ext3 filesystems.
  * Teach mke2fs and tune2fs to set a "test_fs" flag, which indicates
      that it is ok to use the filesystem on in-development kernel
      code (i.e., ext4dev)
  * E2fsck now optimizes non-htree directories by sorting them by inode
      number.
  * Add support for detecting HFS+ and ext4/ext4dev filesystems in blkid
  * Fix blkid's ntfs UUID handling so it is compatible with vol_id
  * Avoid a floating point exception when blkid tries to probe a corrpt
      reiserfs filesystem.

      certain "safe" feature set changes behind the user's back.
  * Fix debugfs's lsdel command so it works on large files
  * Allow a user to undelete an inode with linking to a destination
      directory.

e2fsprogs (1.40.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure that programs like tune2fs, when modifying a mounted
      filesystem do not write the backup superblocks with the
      NEEDS_RECOVERY flag, to avoid e2fsck from needlessly forcing a
      full fsck because it thinks the feature flags need to be backed up
      from the master to the backup superblocks.  (Closes: #454926)
  * Improve time-based UUID generation to guarantee uniqueness even when
      UUID's are being generated at very high rates on SMP systems.  To
      do this we use an optional setuid helper daemon (uuidd) which is
      started by libuuid when it is needed.  The uuidd daemon is
      packaged in the (new) uuid-runtime package, which now also includes
      the uuidgen program (which had been previously been included as
      part of the e2fsprogs package).
  * Fix fsck to only treat '#' characters at the beginning of /etc/fstab
      lines as starting a comment.  This avoids spurious warnings printed
      for filesystems such as fuse that often use '#' as part of the
      filesystem specifier (i.e., wdfs#https://dav.hoster.com/foo).
  * Enhance the blkid program to pretty-print control and meta
      characters to avoid garbage filesystem labels from screwing up the
      user's terminal
  * Fix potential integer overflows passed to malloc() in resize2fs
  * Update Dutch, Polish, and Vietnamese translations from the
      Translation Project.  Remove the Rwandan translation upon advice
      of the Translation Project.
  * Fix cross-compilation support for non-Linux architectures
        (Closes: #451172, #437720)
  * Clarified and improved man pages (Closes: #444883, #441872)
  * Fix potential divide by zero error when libblkid tried probing an
      invalid FAT filesystem.
  * Make error_message() in libcom_err DTRT when when a 64-bit sign-extended
      error code is passed to it.
  * Build the e2fsck-static package so that e2fsck.static will not use
      TLS and hence will run correctly on back-level Debian systems
      using a 2.4 Linux kernel.  (Closes: #458017)

        999,999,999 in its progress display.
  * tune2fs will not allow the user from setting a ridiculous number of
        reserved blocks which would cause e2fsck to assume the superblock
        was corrupt.  E2fsck's standards for what is a ridiculous number
        of reserved blocks has also been relaxed to 50% of the blocks in
        the filesystem.
  * The blkid library will return vfat in preference to msdos, and ext3 in
        preference to ext2 (if the journalling flag is set) so that mount

  * Fix a double-free problem in resize2fs.  (Red Hat Bugzilla #132707)
  * Mke2fs will now accept a size in megabytes or gigabytes (via "32m" or
        "4g" on the command line) if the user finds this more convenient
        than specifying a block count.
  * Fix an obscure, hard-to find bug in "e2fsck -S" caused by an inode
        cache conherency problem.
  * Debugfs now supports a new command, set_inode_field, which allows a
        user to manually set a specific inode field more conveniently, as
        well as set entries in the indirect block map.
  * Debugfs's set_super_value command has been enhanced so that the user
        can set most superblock fields, including the date/time fields and
        some of the more newsly added superblock fields.
  * E2fsprogs programs now accept an offset to be passed to the file
        specifiers, via the syntax: "/tmp/test.img?offset=1024"
  * E2fsprogs will now accept blocksizes up to 65536; kernel support on
        the x86 doesn't exist, but it is useful on other architectures.
  * Fix bug in debugfs where kill_file would lead to errors when deleting
        devices and symlinks.  (Sourceforge Bugs #954741 and #957244)
  * Fix bug in the blkid library when detecting the ocfs1 filesystem

       during the boot sequence
  * Add support for the -a and -s options to logsave.
  * Change e2fsck to bracket its progress bar output with ctrl-A and ctrl-B

  * Make the random number generator more paranoid about potentially buggy
    /dev/random devices.

    few potential hangs, and eliminated a file descriptor leak.
  * E2fsck now updates the global free block and inode counters from
    the block group specific counters quietly.  This is needed for an
    experimental kernel patch which improves SMP scalability by not
    locking the entire filesystem during block or inode allocation; if
    the filesystem is not unmoutned cleanly, the global counts may not
    be accurate.

    If someone misses that, I'll add ${CFLAGS} to --ccopts.

  * This uploads fixes 10 bugs, including data-corruption problems, and
    adds much to the ease of maintainance and problem tracking.  Good
    choice for woody.

    #120171, #120077, #129828, #132764).
  ** Fixes for data-corruption bugs not reported to the BTS: e2fsck
    trashed external journals needing to be replayed, e2fsck now hides
    visible journal files (data corruption problems when not excluded from
    a backup and then restored) (Closes: #132654).
  ** Other noticable bugs fixed include: e2fsck null pointer
    dereferencing, fsck did not finds LVM volumes by UUID or by label,
    largefile support (ie. dealing with filesystems inside 2GB+ files) was
    broken in several programs.
  * Switch to debhelper v3 to get ldconfig automatically handled
    (lintian reported that it was broken).  Now call dh_makeshlibs, but
    still override its generated shlibs file with ours, to get compiled
    packages depend of the correct virtual packages, which include
    full sonames.
  * Removed call do dh_installman (Closes: #115526).
  * Cleaned up maintainer scripts with dead code - most things are now
    more properly handled by debhelper.  Removed an "exit 0" lurking in
    preinst - can't find a reason for it in the changelog, it was probably
    here for ages.
  * Remove obsolete maint-scripts in binary-arch, as they are provided by
    upstream.
  * Also remove upstream-shipped config.cache before configuring.  That
    shouldn't impact us, but well, that makes lintian happy :)

    great help to debug users' problems.  Urgency set to "high" to make
    sure this version gets released with woody.

  ** Fsck prints a warning message if now valid filesystems are passed to
    it. (Closes: #107458).
  ** Fsck -A will not try to interpret device names for filesystems which
    have a pass number is 0. (Closes: #106696).
  ** If -O none is passed to mke2fs, it will now not set the sparse_super

  ** Tune2fs has been fixed to make sure that only error messages go to
    stderr, and normal message go to stdout (Closes: #108555).

  ** e2fsck validates file descriptor specified in -C (Closes: #55220)
  ** Fix multiple progress bar fsck bug (Closes: #65267)
  ** Add devfs support to fsck (Closes: #94159)

  ** New config.{guess,sub} for parisc support (Closes: #94690).
  ** Improved ext3 support
  ** tune2fs can now safely modify mounted filesystems
  * Added missing @dircategory entry to libext2fs.info (lintian)
  * Moved debugfs back from /usr/sbin/ to /sbin/ (Closes: #97035).
  * Moved e2label back to /sbin/ as well, as it is now a hard link to
    tune2fs.
  * New binary package with statically linked e2fsck, recommending a
    statically linked shell (Closes: #62611).
  * All deps against e2fsprogs itself now versionned (lintian).

    for previous maintainers and for Alcove).
  * Remove call to dh_testversion, use versionned build-dep instead
    (lintian).

    necessary for new versions of fakeroot, and requires debhelper 3.0.23
    for a fix.  Well finally 3.0.23 is buggy, leave this for later.
  * Avoid to call ldconfig at "make install" time, too costly.
  * Get rid in control files of references to never-released standalone
    lib files (split attempted in 1997/98).
