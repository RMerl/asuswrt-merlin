Description: statically-linked version of the ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem checker
 This may be of some help to you if your filesystem gets corrupted enough
 to break the shared libraries used by the dynamically linked checker.
 .
 This binary takes much more space than its dynamic counterpart located
 in e2fsprogs, though.
 .
 You may want to install a statically-linked shell as well, to be able
 to run this program if something like your C library gets corrupted.

 libcomerr is an attempt to present a common error-handling mechanism to
 manipulate the most common form of error code in a fashion that does not
 have the problems identified with mechanisms commonly in use.

Recommends: uuid-runtime
Replaces: e2fsprogs (<< 1.34-1)
Architecture: any
Description: Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
 ids (UUIDs).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
 space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
 be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
 short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
 across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.

Description: runtime components for the Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
 ids (UUIDs).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
 space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
 be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
 short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
 across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.  
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUID’s, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face
 of large numbers of threads trying to grab UUID’s running on
 different CPU’s. It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen
 program.
