In order to santize e2fsprogs to be DFSG free, the file
draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt has been removed.  It can be obtained
by downloading e2fsprogs from the upstream sources.  It may also be
available from other sites on the network, if you do a quick web
search for the string "draft-leach-uuids-guids-01".

Note that debian/rules is set up to include the file on Ubuntu
systems, so for people trying to build e2fsprogs on Ubuntu systems,
they should start from the upstream sources, and not the
Debian-expurgated sources found in the Debian repository.  (n.b., for
WIP releases the command "./util/gen-tarball ubuntu" will help create
tar file which is appropriately named to make life easier for
dpkg-buildpackage.)  Since Ubuntu doesn't have the DFSG restrictions,
the documentation which has been removed for Debian's DFSG license
purity shouldn't be denied to Ubuntu users.
