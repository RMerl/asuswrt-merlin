.SH NAME
mklost+found \- create a lost+found directory on a mounted Linux
second extended file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mklost+found
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mklost+found
is used to create a
.I lost+found
directory in the current working directory on a Linux second extended
file system.  There is normally a
.I lost+found
directory in the root directory of each filesystem.
.PP
.B mklost+found
pre-allocates disk blocks to the
.I lost+found
directory so that when
.BR e2fsck (8)
is being run to recover a filesystem, it does not need to allocate blocks in
the filesystem to store a large number of unlinked files.  This ensures that
.B e2fsck
will not have to allocate data blocks in the filesystem during recovery.
.SH OPTIONS
There are none.
.SH AUTHOR

has been written by Remy Card <Remy.Card@linux.org>.  It is currently being
maintained by Theodore Ts'o <tytso@alum.mit.edu>.
