Note: if several inode or block bitmap blocks or part
of the inode table require relocation, you may wish to try
running e2fsck with the '-b 8193' option first.  The problem
may lie only with the primary block group descriptors, and
the backup block group descriptors may be OK.

Inode table for group 0 is not in group.  (block 40000)
WARNING: SEVERE DATA LOSS POSSIBLE.
