/*
 * Notes on DNS Name Escaping
 *   -- or --
 * "Why is kDNSServiceMaxDomainName 1005, when the maximum legal domain name is 255 bytes?"
 *
 * All strings used in DNS-SD are UTF-8 strings.
 * With few exceptions, most are also escaped using standard DNS escaping rules:
 *
 *   '\\' represents a single literal '\' in the name
 *   '\.' represents a single literal '.' in the name
 *   '\ddd', where ddd is a three-digit decimal value from 000 to 255,
 *        represents a single literal byte with that value.
 *   A bare unescaped '.' is a label separator, marking a boundary between domain and subdomain.
 *
 * The exceptions, that do not use escaping, are the routines where the full
 * DNS name of a resource is broken, for convenience, into servicename/regtype/domain.
 * In these routines, the "servicename" is NOT escaped. It does not need to be, since
 * it is, by definition, just a single literal string. Any characters in that string
 * represent exactly what they are. The "regtype" portion is, technically speaking,
 * escaped, but since legal regtypes are only allowed to contain letters, digits,
 * and hyphens, there is nothing to escape, so the issue is moot. The "domain"
 * portion is also escaped, though most domains in use on the public Internet
 * today, like regtypes, don't contain any characters that need to be escaped.
 * As DNS-SD becomes more popular, rich-text domains for service discovery will
 * become common, so software should be written to cope with domains with escaping.
 *
 * The servicename may be up to 63 bytes of UTF-8 text (not counting the C-String
 * terminating NULL at the end). The regtype is of the form _service._tcp or
 * _service._udp, where the "service" part is 1-14 characters, which may be
 * letters, digits, or hyphens. The domain part of the three-part name may be
 * any legal domain, providing that the resulting servicename+regtype+domain
 * name does not exceed 255 bytes.
 *
 * For most software, these issues are transparent. When browsing, the discovered
 * servicenames should simply be displayed as-is. When resolving, the discovered
 * servicename/regtype/domain are simply passed unchanged to DNSServiceResolve().
 * When a DNSServiceResolve() succeeds, the returned fullname is already in
 * the correct format to pass to standard system DNS APIs such as res_query().
 * For converting from servicename/regtype/domain to a single properly-escaped
 * full DNS name, the helper function DNSServiceConstructFullName() is provided.
 *
 * The following (highly contrived) example illustrates the escaping process.
 * Suppose you have an service called "Dr. Smith\Dr. Johnson", of type "_ftp._tcp"
 * in subdomain "4th. Floor" of subdomain "Building 2" of domain "apple.com."
 * The full (escaped) DNS name of this service's SRV record would be:
 * Dr\.\032Smith\\Dr\.\032Johnson._ftp._tcp.4th\.\032Floor.Building\0322.apple.com.
 */


/* 
 * Constants for specifying an interface index
 *
 * Specific interface indexes are identified via a 32-bit unsigned integer returned
 * by the if_nametoindex() family of calls.
 * 
 * If the client passes 0 for interface index, that means "do the right thing",
 * which (at present) means, "if the name is in an mDNS local multicast domain
 * (e.g. 'local.', '254.169.in-addr.arpa.', '{8,9,A,B}.E.F.ip6.arpa.') then multicast
 * on all applicable interfaces, otherwise send via unicast to the appropriate
 * DNS server." Normally, most clients will use 0 for interface index to
 * automatically get the default sensible behaviour.
 * 
 * If the client passes a positive interface index, then for multicast names that
 * indicates to do the operation only on that one interface. For unicast names the
 * interface index is ignored unless kDNSServiceFlagsForceMulticast is also set.
 * 
 * If the client passes kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly when registering
 * a service, then that service will be found *only* by other local clients
 * on the same machine that are browsing using kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly
 * or kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny.
 * If a client has a 'private' service, accessible only to other processes
 * running on the same machine, this allows the client to advertise that service
 * in a way such that it does not inadvertently appear in service lists on
 * all the other machines on the network.
 * 
 * If the client passes kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly when browsing
 * then it will find *all* records registered on that same local machine.
 * Clients explicitly wishing to discover *only* LocalOnly services can
 * accomplish this by inspecting the interfaceIndex of each service reported
 * to their DNSServiceBrowseReply() callback function, and discarding those
 * where the interface index is not kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly.

 *
 * sdRef:           A pointer to an uninitialized DNSServiceRef. If the call succeeds

 *                  and the registration will remain active indefinitely until the client
 *                  terminates it by passing this DNSServiceRef to DNSServiceRefDeallocate().
 *
 * interfaceIndex:  If non-zero, specifies the interface on which to register the service
 *                  (the index for a given interface is determined via the if_nametoindex()
 *                  family of calls.)  Most applications will pass 0 to register on all
 *                  available interfaces. See "Constants for specifying an interface index" for more details.
 *
 * flags:           Indicates the renaming behavior on name conflict (most applications
 *                  will pass 0).  See flag definitions above for details.
 *
 * name:            If non-NULL, specifies the service name to be registered.
 *                  Most applications will not specify a name, in which case the computer
 *                  name is used (this name is communicated to the client via the callback).
 *                  If a name is specified, it must be 1-63 bytes of UTF-8 text.
 *                  If the name is longer than 63 bytes it will be automatically truncated
 *                  to a legal length, unless the NoAutoRename flag is set,
 *                  in which case kDNSServiceErr_BadParam will be returned.
 *
 * regtype:         The service type followed by the protocol, separated by a dot
 *                  (e.g. "_ftp._tcp"). The service type must be an underscore, followed
 *                  by 1-14 characters, which may be letters, digits, or hyphens.
 *                  The transport protocol must be "_tcp" or "_udp". New service types
 *                  should be registered at <http://www.dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html>.
 *
 * domain:          If non-NULL, specifies the domain on which to advertise the service.
 *                  Most applications will not specify a domain, instead automatically
 *                  registering in the default domain(s).
 *
 * host:            If non-NULL, specifies the SRV target host name.  Most applications
 *                  will not specify a host, instead automatically using the machine's
 *                  default host name(s).  Note that specifying a non-NULL host does NOT
 *                  create an address record for that host - the application is responsible
 *                  for ensuring that the appropriate address record exists, or creating it
 *                  via DNSServiceRegisterRecord().
 *
 * port:            The port, in network byte order, on which the service accepts connections.
 *                  Pass 0 for a "placeholder" service (i.e. a service that will not be discovered
 *                  by browsing, but will cause a name conflict if another client tries to
 *                  register that same name).  Most clients will not use placeholder services.
 *
 * txtLen:          The length of the txtRecord, in bytes.  Must be zero if the txtRecord is NULL.
 *
 * txtRecord:       The TXT record rdata. A non-NULL txtRecord MUST be a properly formatted DNS
 *                  TXT record, i.e. <length byte> <data> <length byte> <data> ...
 *                  Passing NULL for the txtRecord is allowed as a synonym for txtLen=1, txtRecord="",
 *                  i.e. it creates a TXT record of length one containing a single empty string.
 *                  RFC 1035 doesn't allow a TXT record to contain *zero* strings, so a single empty
 *                  string is the smallest legal DNS TXT record.
 *                  As with the other parameters, the DNSServiceRegister call copies the txtRecord
 *                  data; e.g. if you allocated the storage for the txtRecord parameter with malloc()
 *                  then you can safely free that memory right after the DNSServiceRegister call returns.
 *
 * callBack:        The function to be called when the registration completes or asynchronously
 *                  fails.  The client MAY pass NULL for the callback -  The client will NOT be notified
 *                  of the default values picked on its behalf, and the client will NOT be notified of any
 *                  asynchronous errors (e.g. out of memory errors, etc.) that may prevent the registration
 *                  of the service.  The client may NOT pass the NoAutoRename flag if the callback is NULL.
 *                  The client may still deregister the service at any time via DNSServiceRefDeallocate().
 *
 * context:         An application context pointer which is passed to the callback function
 *                  (may be NULL).

 *
 * fullname:        The full service domain name, in the form <servicename>.<protocol>.<domain>.
 *                  (This name is escaped following standard DNS rules, making it suitable for
 *                  passing to standard system DNS APIs such as res_query(), or to the
 *                  special-purpose functions included in this API that take fullname parameters.
 *                  See "Notes on DNS Name Escaping" earlier in this file for more details.)
 *
 * hosttarget:      The target hostname of the machine providing the service.  This name can
 *                  be passed to functions like gethostbyname() to identify the host's IP address.
 *
 * port:            The port, in network byte order, on which connections are accepted for this service.
 *
 * txtLen:          The length of the txt record, in bytes.
 *
 * txtRecord:       The service's primary txt record, in standard txt record format.
 *
 * context:         The context pointer that was passed to the callout.
 *
 * NOTE: In earlier versions of this header file, the txtRecord parameter was declared "const char *"
 * This is incorrect, since it contains length bytes which are values in the range 0 to 255, not -128 to +127.
 * Depending on your compiler settings, this change may cause signed/unsigned mismatch warnings.
 * These should be fixed by updating your own callback function definition to match the corrected
 * function signature using "const unsigned char *txtRecord". Making this change may also fix inadvertent
 * bugs in your callback function, where it could have incorrectly interpreted a length byte with value 250
 * as being -6 instead, with various bad consequences ranging from incorrect operation to software crashes.
 * If you need to maintain portable code that will compile cleanly with both the old and new versions of
 * this header file, you should update your callback function definition to use the correct unsigned value,
 * and then in the place where you pass your callback function to DNSServiceResolve(), use a cast to eliminate
 * the compiler warning, e.g.:
 *   DNSServiceResolve(sd, flags, index, name, regtype, domain, (DNSServiceResolveReply)MyCallback, context);
 * This will ensure that your code compiles cleanly without warnings (and more importantly, works correctly)
 * with both the old header and with the new corrected version.

 * You can avoid the need to handle this error condition if you ensure
 * that the storage you initially provide is large enough to hold all
 * the key/value pairs that are to be added to the record.
 * The caller can precompute the exact length required for all of the
 * key/value pairs to be added, or simply provide a fixed-sized buffer
 * known in advance to be large enough.
 * A no-value (key-only) key requires  (1 + key length) bytes.
 * A key with empty value requires     (1 + key length + 1) bytes.
 * A key with non-empty value requires (1 + key length + 1 + value length).
 * For most applications, DNS-SD TXT records are generally
 * less than 100 bytes, so in most cases a simple fixed-sized
 * 256-byte buffer will be more than sufficient.
 * Recommended size limits for DNS-SD TXT Records are discussed in
 * <http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd.txt>
 *
 * Note: When passing parameters to and from these TXT record APIs,
 * the key name does not include the '=' character. The '=' character
 * is the separator between the key and value in the on-the-wire
 * packet format; it is not part of either the key or the value.
 *
 * txtRecord:       A pointer to an uninitialized TXTRecordRef.
 *
 * bufferLen:       The size of the storage provided in the "buffer" parameter.
 *
 * buffer:          Optional caller-supplied storage used to hold the TXTRecord data.
 *                  This storage must remain valid for as long as
 *                  the TXTRecordRef.

 *********************************************************************************************/

/*
 * A typical calling sequence for TXT record parsing is something like:
 *
 * Receive TXT record data in DNSServiceResolve() callback
 * if (TXTRecordContainsKey(txtLen, txtRecord, "key")) then do something
 * val1ptr = TXTRecordGetValuePtr(txtLen, txtRecord, "key1", &len1);
 * val2ptr = TXTRecordGetValuePtr(txtLen, txtRecord, "key2", &len2);
 * ...
 * bcopy(val1ptr, myval1, len1);
 * bcopy(val2ptr, myval2, len2);
 * ...
 * return;
 *
 * If you wish to retain the values after return from the DNSServiceResolve()
 * callback, then you need to copy the data to your own storage using bcopy()
 * or similar, as shown in the example above.
 *
 * If for some reason you need to parse a TXT record you built yourself
 * using the TXT record construction functions above, then you can do
 * that using TXTRecordGetLength and TXTRecordGetBytesPtr calls:
 * TXTRecordGetValue(TXTRecordGetLength(x), TXTRecordGetBytesPtr(x), key, &len);
 *
 * Most applications only fetch keys they know about from a TXT record and
 * ignore the rest.
 * However, some debugging tools wish to fetch and display all keys.
 * To do that, use the TXTRecordGetCount() and TXTRecordGetItemAtIndex() calls.
