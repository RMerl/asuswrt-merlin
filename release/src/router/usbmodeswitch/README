What it is
==========

USB_ModeSwitch is (surprise!) a small mode switching tool for controlling
"flip flop" (multiple mode) USB devices.

Several new USB devices (especially high-speed WAN stuff, based on cell phone
chipsets containing that feature) have their MS Windows drivers onboard; when
plugged in for the first time they act like a flash storage and start
installing the driver from there.
After installation (and on every consecutive plugging) the driver switches the
mode internally, the storage device vanishes (in most cases), and a new device
(like an USB modem) shows up. Modem maker "Option" calls that feature "ZeroCD
(TM)" since it eliminates the need for shipping a separate driver carrier.

In the beginning, nothing of this was documented in any form and there was
hardly any Linux support available.
On the good side, most of the known devices are working out of the box in all
modes with the available Linux modules like "usb-storage" or serial USB drivers.
That leaves only the problem of the mode-switching from storage to whatever
the thing is supposed to do.

Fortunately there are things like human intelligence, USB sniffing programs and
"libusb". It is possible to eavesdrop the communication of the MS Windows
driver, to isolate the command or action that does the switching, and to replay
the same sequence in Linux.

USB_ModeSwitch makes this process easy to handle by taking the relevant para-
meters from a configuration file and doing all the initialization and communi-
cation stuff, with heavy help from "libusb".
It is mainly used automatically - via udev events and rules - to do the switch
without any user interaction. But it can also be run as a command line tool,
usually when trying to make unknown devices work with it.

We have already collected a wide range of information on how to switch all
sorts of devices. If you run into a new one that is unknown yet, don't despair:
we can find out what you need to do!


How to install
==============

!! You need the usb-modeswitch-data package from the same source as this !!

If you have an earlier version installed, de-installation is recommended ("make
uninstall"). The wrapper script location changed in 1.1.0, old ones might be
orphaned in /usr/sbin.

Important: you need "tcl" for the wrapper script to work; if you enter "tclsh"
and you get a "%" prompt, you are set (to exit type "exit"). The "tcl" package
is part of all distributions I know. Use version 8.4 and higher.
If you are space-restricted you can also use the "jimsh" mini Tcl interpreter. The
Tcl wrapper is compatible with the limited command set of this small shell. Since
version 1.1.7 an alternative source package containing jimsh will be provided.
The typical size of jimsh is 140 kB, or 70 kB in a compressed file system.

To install the tool set, unpack and in the newly created directory use this line
at the shell (as root):

> make install

This installs the small shell script, the dispatcher (wrapper) script, a global
config file, the binary and a man page. If you chose the package with jimsh, the
Tcl shell is configured, built and installed in the same step, optimized for
size.

Install the data package as well and you are set already; if your device is
known, you should be able to just plug it and use it. If it doesn't work -
we will find out why not.

For manual use just run "usb_modeswitch" (as root). Work with the command
line interface or with a setup file. You can use any file and give its path
with the "-c" parameter.
The file named "device_reference.txt" that you can find in this package is
a device and configuration reference containing most known devices; you can
use it as a base to create your own configuration file.
It's heavily commented and should tell you what to do. It also contains a
thorough explanation of all the parameters.

Run "usb_modeswitch -h" to list the command line parameters.
See also the provided man page.

Note: manual use is intended for testing and analyzing !

Once your new device is switching fine you can add a rule entry to the rules
file to let udev run usb_modeswitch as soon as the default IDs are found
(when the device is plugged). If you look into the rules file you will see
immediately how your new entry should look like.
The location is:
/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules

Then add your new setup file to the folder
"/usr/share/usb_modeswitch". And don't forget to report your success !!

Again, mind that the rules file and the config folder are installed by
the usb_modeswitch data package.

Important: libusb programs - like this tool - want to be run as root!

Contribute
==========

USB_ModeSwitch comes quite handy for experimenting with your own hardware if
not supported yet. You could try this approach:

Note the device's vendor and product ID from /proc/bus/usb/devices (or from the
output of lsusb); the assigned driver is usually "usb-storage". Then try spying
on the USB communication to the device with the same ID inside M$ Windoze. I
recommend this tool:
"SniffUSB" (http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/index.php.en).

PLEASE post any improvements, new device information and/or bug reports to the
forum (see above) or send it to the author (see below)!
