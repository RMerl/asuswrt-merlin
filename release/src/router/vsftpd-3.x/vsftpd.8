.Dt VSFTPD 8
.Sh NAME
.Nm vsftpd
.Nd Very Secure FTP Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vsftpd
.Op Ar configuration file and / or options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm vsftpd
is the Very Secure File Transfer Protocol Daemon. The server can be launched
via a
.Dq super-server
such as
.Xr inetd 8
or
.Xr xinetd 8 .
Alternatively, vsftpd can be launched in standalone mode, in which case vsftpd
itself will listen on the network. This latter mode is easier to use, and
recommended. It is activated by setting
.Pa listen=YES
in
.Pa /etc/vsftpd.conf .
Direct execution of the
.Nm vsftpd
binary will then launch the FTP service ready for immediate client connections.
.Sh OPTIONS
An optional
configuration file or files
may be given on the command line. These files must be owned as root if running
as root. Any command line option not starting with a "-" character is treated
as a config file that will be loaded. Note that config files are loaded in the
strict order that they are encountered on the command line.
If no config files are specified, the default configuration file of
.Pa /etc/vsftpd.conf
will be loaded, after all other command line options are processed.
.Pp
Supported options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Print the version information and exit, even if other options are encountered.
.It Fl ooption=value
Set a single option, value pair as per the format in the config file. Multiple
-o options are supported, and they are applied in strict order relative to
their appearance on the command line, including intermingling with loading of
config files.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
vsftpd -olisten=NO /etc/vsftpd.conf -oftpd_banner=blah
.Pp
That example overrides vsftpd's built-in default for the "listen" option to be
NO, but then loads /etc/vsftpd.conf which may override that setting. Finally,
the "ftpd_banner" setting is set to "blah", which overrides any default vsftpd
setting and any identical setting that was in the config file.
