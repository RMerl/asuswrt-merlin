I'm not sure what you expected to find in this file :-)

Anyway, this is to explain that vsftpd is not as much code as you might
expect from running a command like "wc -l *.c". Why? Simply because I use
a very verbose style of coding in vsftpd, which consumes a lot of lines.
Verbose code is very important in a secure program. How can you verify a
program's security if it is not readable?
