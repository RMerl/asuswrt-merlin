.SH "Name"
smb.conf \- The configuration file for the Samba suite
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
The
\FCsmb\&.conf\F[]
file is a configuration file for the Samba suite\&.
\FCsmb\&.conf\F[]
contains runtime configuration information for the Samba programs\&. The
\FCsmb\&.conf\F[]
file is designed to be configured and administered by the
\fBswat\fR(8)
program\&. The complete description of the file format and possible parameters held within are here for reference purposes\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of sections and parameters\&. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\&. Sections contain parameters of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.fam C
.ps -1
.nf
.if t \{\
.sp -1
.\}
.BB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.sp -1

\fIname\fR = \fIvalue \fR
.EB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.if t \{\
.sp 1
.\}
.fi
.fam
.ps +1
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The file is line\-based \- that is, each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter\&.
.PP
Section and parameter names are not case sensitive\&.
.PP
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant\&. Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded\&. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant\&. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded\&. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim\&.
.PP
Any line beginning with a semicolon (\(lq;\(rq) or a hash (\(lq#\(rq) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace\&.
.PP
Any line ending in a
\(lq\FC\e\F[]\(rq
is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion\&.
.PP
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 0/1 or true/false\&. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values\&. Some items such as create masks are numeric\&.
.SH "SECTION DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP
Each section in the configuration file (except for the [global] section) describes a shared resource (known as a
\(lqshare\(rq)\&. The section name is the name of the shared resource and the parameters within the section define the shares attributes\&.
.PP
There are three special sections, [global], [homes] and [printers], which are described under
\fIspecial sections\fR\&. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions\&.
.PP
A share consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of the service\&. Some housekeeping options are also specifiable\&.
.PP
Sections are either file share services (used by the client as an extension of their native file systems) or printable services (used by the client to access print services on the host running the server)\&.
.PP
Sections may be designated
\fIguest\fR
services, in which case no password is required to access them\&. A specified UNIX
\fIguest account\fR
is used to define access privileges in this case\&.
.PP
Sections other than guest services will require a password to access them\&. The client provides the username\&. As older clients only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list of usernames to check against the password using the
\FCuser =\F[]
option in the share definition\&. For modern clients such as Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary\&.
.PP
The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host system\&. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants\&.
.PP
The following sample section defines a file space share\&. The user has write access to the path
\FC/home/bar\F[]\&. The share is accessed via the share name
\FCfoo\F[]:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.fam C
.ps -1
.nf
.if t \{\
.sp -1
.\}
.BB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.sp -1

	\fI[foo]\fR
	\m[blue]\fBpath = /home/bar\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBread only = no\fR\m[]
.EB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.if t \{\
.sp 1
.\}
.fi
.fam
.ps +1
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The following sample section defines a printable share\&. The share is read\-only, but printable\&. That is, the only write access permitted is via calls to open, write to and close a spool file\&. The
\fIguest ok\fR
parameter means access will be permitted as the default guest user (specified elsewhere):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.fam C
.ps -1
.nf
.if t \{\
.sp -1
.\}
.BB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.sp -1

	\fI[aprinter]\fR
	\m[blue]\fBpath = /usr/spool/public\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBread only = yes\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBprintable = yes\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBguest ok = yes\fR\m[]
.EB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline

.sp
.SH "SPECIAL SECTIONS"
.SS "The [global] section"
.PP
Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole, or are defaults for sections that do not specifically define certain items\&. See the notes under PARAMETERS for more information\&.
.SS "The [homes] section"
.PP
If a section called [homes] is included in the configuration file, services connecting clients to their home directories can be created on the fly by the server\&.
.PP
When the connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned\&. If a match is found, it is used\&. If no match is found, the requested section name is treated as a username and looked up in the local password file\&. If the name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is created by cloning the [homes] section\&.
.PP
Some modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The share name is changed from homes to the located username\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If no path was given, the path is set to the user\'s home directory\&.
.sp
.RE
.PP
If you decide to use a
\fIpath =\fR
line in your [homes] section, it may be useful to use the %S macro\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.fam C
.ps -1
.nf
.if t \{\
.sp -1
.\}
.BB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.sp -1

\fBpath = /data/pchome/%S\fR
.EB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.if t \{\
.sp 1
.\}
.fi
.fam
.ps +1
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
is useful if you have different home directories for your PCs than for UNIX access\&.
.PP
This is a fast and simple way to give a large number of clients access to their home directories with a minimum of fuss\&.
.PP
A similar process occurs if the requested section name is
\(lqhomes\(rq, except that the share name is not changed to that of the requesting user\&. This method of using the [homes] section works well if different users share a client PC\&.
.PP
The [homes] section can specify all the parameters a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense than others\&. The following is a typical and suitable [homes] section:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.fam C
.ps -1
.nf
.if t \{\
.sp -1
.\}
.BB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.sp -1

\fI[homes]\fR
\m[blue]\fBread only = no\fR\m[]
.EB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.if t \{\
.sp 1
.\}
.fi
.fam
.ps +1
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
An important point is that if guest access is specified in the [homes] section, all home directories will be visible to all clients
\fIwithout a password\fR\&. In the very unlikely event that this is actually desirable, it is wise to also specify
\fIread only access\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fIbrowseable\fR
flag for auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable flag, not the [homes] browseable flag\&. This is useful as it means setting
\fIbrowseable = no\fR
in the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make any auto home directories visible\&.
.SS "The [printers] section"
.PP
This section works like [homes], but for printers\&.
.PP
If a [printers] section occurs in the configuration file, users are able to connect to any printer specified in the local host\'s printcap file\&.
.PP
When a connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned\&. If a match is found, it is used\&. If no match is found, but a [homes] section exists, it is used as described above\&. Otherwise, the requested section name is treated as a printer name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see if the requested section name is a valid printer share name\&. If a match is found, a new printer share is created by cloning the [printers] section\&.
.PP
A few modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The share name is set to the located printer name
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If no printer name was given, the printer name is set to the located printer name
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the share does not permit guest access and no username was given, the username is set to the located printer name\&.
.sp
.RE
.PP
The [printers] service MUST be printable \- if you specify otherwise, the server will refuse to load the configuration file\&.
.PP
Typically the path specified is that of a world\-writeable spool directory with the sticky bit set on it\&. A typical [printers] entry looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.fam C
.ps -1
.nf
.if t \{\
.sp -1
.\}
.BB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.sp -1

\fI[printers]\fR
\m[blue]\fBpath = /usr/spool/public\fR\m[]
\m[blue]\fBguest ok = yes\fR\m[]
\m[blue]\fBprintable = yes\fR\m[]
.EB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.if t \{\
.sp 1
.\}
.fi
.fam
.ps +1
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file are legitimate printer names as far as the server is concerned\&. If your printing subsystem doesn\'t work like that, you will have to set up a pseudo\-printcap\&. This is a file consisting of one or more lines like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.fam C
.ps -1
.nf
.if t \{\
.sp -1
.\}
.BB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.sp -1

alias|alias|alias|alias\&.\&.\&.    
.EB lightgray adjust-for-leading-newline
.if t \{\
.sp 1
.\}
.fi
.fam
.ps +1
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for your printing subsystem\&. In the [global] section, specify the new file as your printcap\&. The server will only recognize names found in your pseudo\-printcap, which of course can contain whatever aliases you like\&. The same technique could be used simply to limit access to a subset of your local printers\&.
.PP
An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the first entry of a printcap record\&. Records are separated by newlines, components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical bar symbols (\FC|\F[])\&.

On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what printers are defined on the system you may be able to use

.SH "PARAMETERS"

Parameters define the specific attributes of sections\&.
.PP
Some parameters are specific to the [global] section (e\&.g\&.,
\fIsecurity\fR)\&. Some parameters are usable in all sections (e\&.g\&.,
\fIcreate mask\fR)\&. All others are permissible only in normal sections\&. For the purposes of the following descriptions the [homes] and [printers] sections will be considered normal\&. The letter
\fIG\fR
in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the [global] section\&. The letter
\fIS\fR
indicates that a parameter can be specified in a service specific section\&. All
\fIS\fR
parameters can also be specified in the [global] section \- in which case they will define the default behavior for all services\&.
.PP
Parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order \- this may not create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where there are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer to the preferred synonym\&.
.SH "VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS"
.PP
Many of the strings that are settable in the config file can take substitutions\&. For example the option
\(lqpath = /tmp/%u\(rq
is interpreted as
\(lqpath = /tmp/john\(rq
if the user connected with the username john\&.
.PP
These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, but there are some general substitutions which apply whenever they might be relevant\&. These are:
.PP
%U
.RS 4
session username (the username that the client wanted, not necessarily the same as the one they got)\&.
.RE
.PP
%G
.RS 4
primary group name of %U\&.
.RE
.PP
%h
.RS 4
the Internet hostname that Samba is running on\&.
.RE
.PP
%m
.RS 4
the NetBIOS name of the client machine (very useful)\&.
.sp
This parameter is not available when Samba listens on port 445, as clients no longer send this information\&. If you use this macro in an include statement on a domain that has a Samba domain controller be sure to set in the [global] section
\fIsmb ports = 139\fR\&. This will cause Samba to not listen on port 445 and will permit include functionality to function as it did with Samba 2\&.x\&.
.RE
.PP
%L
.RS 4
the NetBIOS name of the server\&. This allows you to change your config based on what the client calls you\&. Your server can have a
\(lqdual personality\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
%M
.RS 4
the Internet name of the client machine\&.
.RE
.PP
%R
.RS 4
the selected protocol level after protocol negotiation\&. It can be one of CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2 or NT1\&.
.RE
.PP
%d
.RS 4
the process id of the current server process\&.
.RE

Anything else will be known as
\fBUNKNOWN\fR\&.
.RE

primary group name of %u\&.
.RE
.PP
%H
.RS 4
the home directory of the user given by %u\&.
.RE
.PP
%N
.RS 4
the name of your NIS home directory server\&. This is obtained from your NIS auto\&.map entry\&. If you have not compiled Samba with the
\fI\-\-with\-automount\fR
option, this value will be the same as %L\&.
.RE
.PP
%p
.RS 4
the path of the service\'s home directory, obtained from your NIS auto\&.map entry\&. The NIS auto\&.map entry is split up as
\FC%N:%p\F[]\&.
.RE
.PP
There are some quite creative things that can be done with these substitutions and other
\FCsmb\&.conf\F[]
options\&.
.SH "NAME MANGLING"
.PP
Samba supports
\FCname mangling\F[]
so that DOS and Windows clients can use files that don\'t conform to the 8\&.3 format\&. It can also be set to adjust the case of 8\&.3 format filenames\&.
.PP
There are several options that control the way mangling is performed, and they are grouped here rather than listed separately\&. For the defaults look at the output of the testparm program\&.
.PP
These options can be set separately for each service\&.

This boolean parameter controls what
\fBsmbd\fR(8)does on receiving a protocol request of "open for delete" from a Windows client\&. If a Windows client doesn\'t have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time\&. POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory\&. As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file\&. With this parameter set to true (the default) then smbd checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it\&. This is not perfect, as it\'s possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly, but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour\&. Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case\&.

If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn\'t check permissions on "open for delete" and allows the open\&. If the user doesn\'t have permission to delete the file this will only be discovered at close time, which is too late for the Windows user tools to display an error message to the user\&.

.sp
For name service it causes

\FCnmbd\F[]

\FCnmbd\F[]
will check the source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast sockets and discard any that don\'t match the broadcast addresses of the interfaces in the

\FCnmbd\F[]
to refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive through any interfaces not listed in the

This parameter is only applicable to

Because smbd is unable to execute the driver code to generate the device mode, the default behavior is to set this field to NULL\&.

Most problems with serving printer drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients can be traced to a problem with the generated device mode\&. Certain drivers will do things such as crashing the client\'s Explorer\&.exe with a NULL devmode\&.

This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares\&. If oplocks are enabled on a share, Visual C++ uses two different time reading calls to check if a file has changed since it was last read\&. One of these calls uses a one\-second granularity, the other uses a two second granularity\&. As the two second call rounds any odd second down, then if the file has a timestamp of an odd number of seconds then the two timestamps will not match and Visual C++ will keep reporting the file has changed\&.

.RS 4
NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create time for all files and directories\&. This is not the same as the ctime \- status change time \- that Unix keeps, so Samba by default reports the earliest of the various times Unix does keep\&. Setting this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 1\-1\-1980 as the create time for directories\&.
.sp
This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares\&. Visual C++ generated makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object file, and a make rule to create the directory\&. Also, when NMAKE compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a directory\&. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier timestamp than the object files it contains\&.
.sp
However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or or deleted in the directory\&. NMAKE finds all object files in the object directory\&. The timestamp of the last one built is then compared to the timestamp of the object directory\&. If the directory\'s timestamp if newer, then all object files will be rebuilt\&. Enabling this option ensures directories always predate their contents and an NMAKE build will proceed as expected\&.

By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the Unix\-style NSS subsystem to access user and group information\&. Due to the way Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group this inevitably leads to inefficiencies\&. One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he is member of\&. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP\&. UNIX has optimized functions to enumerate group membership\&. Sadly, other functions that are used to deal with user and group attributes lack such optimization\&.

To make Samba scale well in large environments, the

It further assumes that the Samba auxiliary object classes are stored together with the POSIX data in the same LDAP object\&. If these assumptions are met,

This controls whether non\-DOS names under UNIX should be mapped to DOS\-compatible names ("mangled") and made visible, or whether non\-DOS names should simply be ignored\&.
.sp
See the section on
\m[blue]\fBname mangling\fR\m[]

.sp
If mangling is used then the mangling algorithm is as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The first (up to) five alphanumeric characters before the rightmost dot of the filename are preserved, forced to upper case, and appear as the first (up to) five characters of the mangled name\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
A tilde "~" is appended to the first part of the mangled name, followed by a two\-character unique sequence, based on the original root name (i\&.e\&., the original filename minus its final extension)\&. The final extension is included in the hash calculation only if it contains any upper case characters or is longer than three characters\&.
.sp
Note that the character to use may be specified using the
\m[blue]\fBmangling char\fR\m[]
option, if you don\'t like \'~\'\&.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

Files whose UNIX name begins with a dot will be presented as DOS hidden files\&. The mangled name will be created as for other filenames, but with the leading dot removed and "___" as its extension regardless of actual original extension (that\'s three underscores)\&.
.sp
.RE
The two\-digit hash value consists of upper case alphanumeric characters\&.
.sp
This algorithm can cause name collisions only if files in a directory share the same first five alphanumeric characters\&. The probability of such a clash is 1/1300\&.
.sp
The name mangling (if enabled) allows a file to be copied between UNIX directories from Windows/DOS while retaining the long UNIX filename\&. UNIX files can be renamed to a new extension from Windows/DOS and will retain the same basename\&. Mangled names do not change between sessions\&.

\fBsmbd\fR(8)
uses to determine what to send to the

and what to expect back\&. If the expected output is not received then the password is not changed\&.
.sp
This chat sequence is often quite site specific, depending on what local methods are used for password control (such as NIS etc)\&.
.sp
Note that this parameter only is only used if the
\m[blue]\fBunix password sync\fR\m[]
parameter is set to
\fByes\fR\&. This sequence is then called
\fIAS ROOT\fR
when the SMB password in the smbpasswd file is being changed, without access to the old password cleartext\&. This means that root must be able to reset the user\'s password without knowing the text of the previous password\&. In the presence of NIS/YP, this means that the
\m[blue]\fBpasswd program\fR\m[]
must be executed on the NIS master\&.
.sp
The string can contain the macro
\fI%n\fR
which is substituted for the new password\&. The old passsword (\fI%o\fR) is only available when
\m[blue]\fBencrypt passwords\fR\m[]
has been disabled\&. The chat sequence can also contain the standard macros \en, \er, \et and \es to give line\-feed, carriage\-return, tab and space\&. The chat sequence string can also contain a \'*\' which matches any sequence of characters\&. Double quotes can be used to collect strings with spaces in them into a single string\&.
.sp
If the send string in any part of the chat sequence is a full stop "\&.", then no string is sent\&. Similarly, if the expect string is a full stop then no string is expected\&.
.sp
If the
\m[blue]\fBpam password change\fR\m[]
parameter is set to
\fByes\fR, the chat pairs may be matched in any order, and success is determined by the PAM result, not any particular output\&. The \en macro is ignored for PAM conversions\&.

Some client/server combinations have difficulty with mixed\-case passwords\&. One offending client is Windows for Workgroups, which for some reason forces passwords to upper case when using the LANMAN1 protocol, but leaves them alone when using COREPLUS! Another problem child is the Windows 95/98 family of operating systems\&. These clients upper case clear text passwords even when NT LM 0\&.12 selected by the protocol negotiation request/response\&.
.sp
This parameter defines the maximum number of characters that may be upper case in passwords\&.

For example, say the password given was "FRED"\&. If

"Fred", "fred", "fRed", "frEd","freD"

.sp
"FRed", "FrEd", "FreD", "fREd", "fReD", "frED", \&.\&.

.sp
The higher value this parameter is set to the more likely it is that a mixed case password will be matched against a single case password\&. However, you should be aware that use of this parameter reduces security and increases the time taken to process a new connection\&.
.sp
A value of zero will cause only two attempts to be made \- the password as is and the password in all\-lower case\&.

profile acls (S)

.PP
.RS 4
This boolean parameter was added to fix the problems that people have been having with storing user profiles on Samba shares from Windows 2000 or Windows XP clients\&. New versions of Windows 2000 or Windows XP service packs do security ACL checking on the owner and ability to write of the profile directory stored on a local workstation when copied from a Samba share\&.
.sp
When not in domain mode with winbindd then the security info copied onto the local workstation has no meaning to the logged in user (SID) on that workstation so the profile storing fails\&. Adding this parameter onto a share used for profile storage changes two things about the returned Windows ACL\&. Firstly it changes the owner and group owner of all reported files and directories to be BUILTIN\e\eAdministrators, BUILTIN\e\eUsers respectively (SIDs S\-1\-5\-32\-544, S\-1\-5\-32\-545)\&. Secondly it adds an ACE entry of "Full Control" to the SID BUILTIN\e\eUsers to every returned ACL\&. This will allow any Windows 2000 or XP workstation user to access the profile\&.
.sp
Note that if you have multiple users logging on to a workstation then in order to prevent them from being able to access each others profiles you must remove the "Bypass traverse checking" advanced user right\&. This will prevent access to other users profile directories as the top level profile directory (named after the user) is created by the workstation profile code and has an ACL restricting entry to the directory tree to the owning user\&.

When strict locking is set to Auto (the default), the server performs file lock checks only on non\-oplocked files\&. As most Windows redirectors perform file locking checks locally on oplocked files this is a good trade off for inproved performance\&.

This parameter applies only to Windows NT/2000 clients\&. It has no effect on Windows 95/98/ME clients\&. When serving a printer to Windows NT/2000 clients without first installing a valid printer driver on the Samba host, the client will be required to install a local printer driver\&. From this point on, the client will treat the print as a local printer and not a network printer connection\&. This is much the same behavior that will occur when
\FCdisable spoolss = yes\F[]\&.
.sp
The differentiating factor is that under normal circumstances, the NT/2000 client will attempt to open the network printer using MS\-RPC\&. The problem is that because the client considers the printer to be local, it will attempt to issue the OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated with the logged on user\&. If the user possesses local administator rights but not root privilege on the Samba host (often the case), the OpenPrinterEx() call will fail\&. The result is that the client will now display an "Access Denied; Unable to connect" message in the printer queue window (even though jobs may successfully be printed)\&.

username map (G)
.\" username map
.PP
.RS 4
This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server\&. This can be used for several purposes\&. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses\&. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files\&.
.sp
Please note that for user or share mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user credentials\&. Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified enties in the map table (e\&.g\&. biddle =
\FCDOMAIN\efoo\F[])\&.
.sp
The map file is parsed line by line\&. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a \'=\' followed by a list of usernames on the right\&. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group\&. The special client name \'*\' is a wildcard and matches any name\&. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long\&.
.sp
The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the \'=\' signs\&. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left\&. Processing then continues with the next line\&.
.sp
If any line begins with a \'#\' or a \';\' then it is ignored\&.
.sp
If any line begins with an \'!\' then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line\&. Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed\&. Using \'!\' is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file\&.
.sp
For example to map from the name
\fBadmin\fR

\fBadministrator\fR

would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username "tridge"\&.
.sp
The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest\&. Note the use of the \'!\' to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:

.sp
Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames\&. Thus if you connect to \e\eserver\efred and
\fBfred\fR
is remapped to
\fBmary\fR
then you will actually be connecting to \e\eserver\emary and will need to supply a password suitable for
\fBmary\fR
not
\fBfred\fR\&. The only exception to this is the username passed to the
\m[blue]\fBpassword server\fR\m[]
(if you have one)\&. The password server will receive whatever username the client supplies without modification\&.
.sp
Also note that no reverse mapping is done\&. The main effect this has is with printing\&. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don\'t own the print job\&.
.sp
Samba versions prior to 3\&.0\&.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e\&.g\&.:
\FCDOMAIN\euser\F[]) from the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client\&. However, when looking up a map entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be used for matches\&. This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes even on the same server\&.
.sp
The following functionality is obeyed in version 3\&.0\&.8 and later:
.sp
When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate the connection\&.
.sp
When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map to the fully qualified username (i\&.e\&.

This parameter specifies a list of absolute pathnames the root of which are NOT allowed to be exported by user defined share definitions\&. If the pathname exported starts with one of the strings in this list the user defined share will not be allowed\&.

This cache allows Samba to batch client writes into a more efficient write size for RAID disks (i\&.e\&. writes may be tuned to be the RAID stripe size) and can improve performance on systems where the disk subsystem is a bottleneck but there is free memory for userspace programs\&.
.sp
The integer parameter specifies the size of this cache (per oplocked file) in bytes\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI\fIwrite cache size\fR\fR\fI = \fR\fI\FC0\F[]\fR\fI \fR
.sp
Example:
\fI\fIwrite cache size\fR\fR\fI = \fR\fI\FC262144 # for a 256k cache size per file\F[]\fR\fI \fR

write list (S)
.\" write list
.PP
.RS 4
This is a list of users that are given read\-write access to a service\&. If the connecting user is in this list then they will be given write access, no matter what the
\m[blue]\fBread only\fR\m[]
option is set to\&. The list can include group names using the @group syntax\&.
.sp
Note that if a user is in both the read list and the write list then they will be given write access\&.
.sp
By design, this parameter will not work with the
\m[blue]\fBsecurity = share\fR\m[]
in Samba 3\&.0\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI\fIwrite list\fR\fR\fI = \fR\fI\FC\F[]\fR\fI \fR
.sp
Example:
\fI\fIwrite list\fR\fR\fI = \fR\fI\FCadmin, root, @staff\F[]\fR\fI \fR

write raw (G)
.\" write raw
.PP
.RS 4
This parameter controls whether or not the server will support raw write SMB\'s when transferring data from clients\&. You should never need to change this parameter\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI\fIwrite raw\fR\fR\fI = \fR\fI\FCyes\F[]\fR\fI \fR
.RE

wtmp directory (G)
.\" wtmp directory
.PP
.RS 4
This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled with the option
\FC \-\-with\-utmp\F[]\&. It specifies a directory pathname that is used to store the wtmp or wtmpx files (depending on the UNIX system) that record user connections to a Samba server\&. The difference with the utmp directory is the fact that user info is kept after a user has logged out\&.
.sp
By default this is not set, meaning the system will use whatever utmp file the native system is set to use (usually
\FC/var/run/wtmp\F[]
on Linux)\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI\fIwtmp directory\fR\fR\fI = \fR\fI\FC\F[]\fR\fI \fR
.sp
Example:
\fI\fIwtmp directory\fR\fR\fI = \fR\fI\FC/var/log/wtmp\F[]\fR\fI \fR

.SH "WARNINGS"
.PP
Although the configuration file permits service names to contain spaces, your client software may not\&. Spaces will be ignored in comparisons anyway, so it shouldn\'t be a problem \- but be aware of the possibility\&.
.PP
On a similar note, many clients \- especially DOS clients \- limit service names to eight characters\&.
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
has no such limitation, but attempts to connect from such clients will fail if they truncate the service names\&. For this reason you should probably keep your service names down to eight characters in length\&.
.PP
Use of the
\FC[homes]\F[]
and
\FC[printers]\F[]
special sections make life for an administrator easy, but the various combinations of default attributes can be tricky\&. Take extreme care when designing these sections\&. In particular, ensure that the permissions on spool directories are correct\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\&.2 for Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
