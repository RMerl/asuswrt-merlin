is usually invoked indirectly by
the <a class="citerefentry" href="mount.8.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mount</span>(8)</span></a> command when using the 
"-t cifs" option. This command only works in Linux, and the kernel must
support the cifs filesystem. The CIFS protocol is the successor to the 
SMB protocol and is supported by most Windows servers and many other
commercial servers and Network Attached Storage appliances as well as 
by the popular Open Source server Samba.

	The mount.cifs utility attaches the UNC name (exported network resource)
	specified as <span class="emphasis"><em>service</em></span> (using //server/share syntax,
	where "server" is the server name or IP address and "share" is the name
	of the share) to the local directory <span class="emphasis"><em>mount-point</em></span>.
	It is possible to set the mode for mount.cifs to setuid root to allow
	non-root users to mount shares to directories for which they
	have write permission.
	</p><p>
		Options to <span class="emphasis"><em>mount.cifs</em></span> are specified as a comma-separated
list of key=value pairs. It is possible to send options other
than those listed here, assuming that the cifs filesystem kernel module (cifs.ko) supports them.   
Unrecognized cifs mount options passed to the cifs vfs kernel code will be logged to the
kernel log.

	It may be specified as either a username or a numeric uid.
	For mounts to servers which do support the CIFS Unix extensions, 
        such as a properly configured Samba server, the server provides
                the uid, gid and mode so this parameter should not be
                specified unless the server and client uid and gid
                numbering differ.  If the server and client are in the
                same domain (e.g. running winbind or nss_ldap) and
                the server supports the Unix Extensions then the uid
                and gid can be retrieved from the server (and uid
                and gid would not have to be specified on the mount.
                For servers which do not support the CIFS Unix
                extensions, the default uid (and gid) returned on lookup 
                of existing files will be the uid (gid) of the person
                who executed the mount (root, except when mount.cifs
                is configured setuid for user mounts) unless the "uid="
                (gid) mount option is specified.  For the uid (gid) of newly
                created files and directories, ie files created since
                the last mount of the server share, the expected uid
                (gid) is cached as long as the inode remains in
                memory on the client.   Also note that permission
                checks (authorization checks) on accesses to a file occur
                at the server, but there are cases in which an administrator
                may want to restrict at the client as well.  For those
                servers which do not report a uid/gid owner
                (such as Windows), permissions can also be checked at the
                client, and a crude form of client side permission checking
                can be enabled by specifying file_mode and dir_mode on
                the client.  Note that the mount.cifs helper must be
                at version 1.10 or higher to support specifying the uid
                (or gid) in non-numeric form.

The primary mechanism for making configuration changes and for reading 
debug information for the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem.
In the directory <code class="filename">/proc/fs/cifs</code> are various 
configuration files and pseudo files which can display debug information.  
There are additional startup options such as maximum buffer size and number
of buffers which only may be set when the kernel cifs vfs (cifs.ko module) is 
loaded.  These can be seen by running the modinfo utility against the file
cifs.ko which will list the options that may be passed to cifs during module
installation (device driver load).
For more information see the kernel file <code class="filename">fs/cifs/README</code>.
