samba PMDA
===========

This PMDA is a sample that illustrates how a simple samba monitor
PMDA might be constructed, using a shared memory segment to transfer
information about transaction activity from the smb daemon.

Note:
	This PMDA may be remade from source and hence requires 
	a C compiler and Perl to be installed.

	Uses of make(1) may fail (without removing or clobbering files)
	if the C compiler cannot be found.  This is most likely to
	happen when running the PMDA ./Install script.

	The only remedial action is to install the C compiler, or
	hand-craft changes to the Makefile.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT samba

Installation
============

 +  # mkdir /var/pcp/pmdas/samba
 +  # cp * /var/pcp/pmdas/samba
 +  # cp ../source/include/profile.h /var/pcp/pmdas/samba
 +  # cd /var/pcp/pmdas/samba

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use
    (/etc/pmcd.conf).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  If you are not installing on an IRIX system, edit samba.c and
    comment out the 

	#define IRIX 1

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

 +  Alternatively, to install just the Performance Metrics Name Space
    for the samba metrics on the local system, but not the samba PMDA
    (presumably because the local system is running PCP 1.x and you
    wish to connect to a remote system where PCP 2.0 and the samba PMDA
    is running), make sure the Performance Metrics Domain defined in
    ./domain.h matches the domain chosen for the samba PMDA on the
    remote system (check the second field in the corresponding line of
    the pmcd.conf file on the remote system - located in /etc on IRIX
    and /var/pcp/config/pmcd on Linux), then

	# ./Install -N

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

        # cd /var/pcp/pmdas/samba
	# ./Remove

 +  If you also want to remove the sources use

	# cd /
	# rm -rf /var/pcp/pmdas/samba

Making something happen
=======================

The application "smbd" updates the shared memory segment to add
profile information about smbd. By default updating is disabled.
To start updating of the shared memory segment you need to run the
smbcontrol command to turn on profiling for one or more smbd processes
(see the man page for smbcontrol).



Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    (pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file (samba.log) should be checked 
    for any warnings or errors. These logs are located in 
    /var/log/pcp/pmcd on Linux and /var/adm/pcplog on IRIX.
