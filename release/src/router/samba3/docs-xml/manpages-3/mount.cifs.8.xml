	<title>DESCRIPTION</title>

	<para>This tool is part of the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>samba</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry> suite.</para>

	<para>mount.cifs mounts a Linux CIFS filesystem. It
is usually invoked indirectly by
the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>mount</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> command when using the 
"-t cifs" option. This command only works in Linux, and the kernel must
support the cifs filesystem. The CIFS protocol is the successor to the 
SMB protocol and is supported by most Windows servers and many other
commercial servers and Network Attached Storage appliances as well as 
by the popular Open Source server Samba.
	</para>

	<para>
	The mount.cifs utility attaches the UNC name (exported network resource)
	specified as <emphasis>service</emphasis> (using //server/share syntax,
	where "server" is the server name or IP address and "share" is the name
	of the share) to the local directory <emphasis>mount-point</emphasis>.
	It is possible to set the mode for mount.cifs to setuid root to allow
	non-root users to mount shares to directories for which they
	have write permission.
	</para>

	<para>
		Options to <emphasis>mount.cifs</emphasis> are specified as a comma-separated
list of key=value pairs. It is possible to send options other
than those listed here, assuming that the cifs filesystem kernel module (cifs.ko) supports them.   
Unrecognized cifs mount options passed to the cifs vfs kernel code will be logged to the
kernel log.

	</para>

	<para><emphasis>mount.cifs</emphasis> causes the cifs vfs to launch a thread named cifsd. After mounting it keeps running until
		the mounted resource is unmounted (usually via the umount utility).
	</para>

	<title>OPTIONS</title>
	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry><term>user=<replaceable>arg</replaceable></term>

		<listitem><para>specifies the username to connect as. If
				this is not given, then the environment variable <emphasis>USER</emphasis> is used. This option can also take the
form "user%password" or "workgroup/user" or
"workgroup/user%password" to allow the password and workgroup
to be specified as part of the username.
		</para>

<note>
	<para>
	The cifs vfs accepts the parameter <parameter>user=</parameter>, or for users familiar with smbfs it accepts the longer form of the parameter <parameter>username=</parameter>.  Similarly the longer smbfs style parameter names may be accepted as synonyms for the shorter cifs parameters <parameter>pass=</parameter>,<parameter>dom=</parameter> and <parameter>cred=</parameter>.
	</para>
</note>

		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>password=<replaceable>arg</replaceable></term>

		<listitem><para>specifies the CIFS password. If this
option is not given then the environment variable
<emphasis>PASSWD</emphasis> is used. If the password is not specified
directly or indirectly via an argument to mount, <emphasis>mount.cifs</emphasis> will prompt
for a password, unless the guest option is specified.
</para>

<para>Note that a password which contains the delimiter
character (i.e. a comma ',') will fail to be parsed correctly
on the command line.  However, the same password defined
in the PASSWD environment variable or via a credentials file (see
below) or entered at the password prompt will be read correctly.
</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>credentials=<replaceable>filename</replaceable></term>

		<listitem><para>
				specifies a file that contains a username
				and/or password and optionally the name of the
				workgroup. The format of the file is:
			</para>

<programlisting>
		username=<replaceable>value</replaceable>
		password=<replaceable>value</replaceable>
		workgroup=<replaceable>value</replaceable>
</programlisting>

		<para>
This is preferred over having passwords in plaintext in a
shared file, such as <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. Be sure to protect any
credentials file properly.
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
		<term>uid=<replaceable>arg</replaceable></term>

		<listitem><para>sets the uid that will own all files on
	the mounted filesystem.
	It may be specified as either a username or a numeric uid.
	For mounts to servers which do support the CIFS Unix extensions, 
        such as a properly configured Samba server, the server provides
                the uid, gid and mode so this parameter should not be
                specified unless the server and client uid and gid
                numbering differ.  If the server and client are in the
                same domain (e.g. running winbind or nss_ldap) and
                the server supports the Unix Extensions then the uid
                and gid can be retrieved from the server (and uid
                and gid would not have to be specified on the mount.
                For servers which do not support the CIFS Unix
                extensions, the default uid (and gid) returned on lookup 
                of existing files will be the uid (gid) of the person
                who executed the mount (root, except when mount.cifs
                is configured setuid for user mounts) unless the "uid="
                (gid) mount option is specified.  For the uid (gid) of newly
                created files and directories, ie files created since
                the last mount of the server share, the expected uid
                (gid) is cached as long as the inode remains in
                memory on the client.   Also note that permission
                checks (authorization checks) on accesses to a file occur
                at the server, but there are cases in which an administrator
                may want to restrict at the client as well.  For those
                servers which do not report a uid/gid owner
                (such as Windows), permissions can also be checked at the
                client, and a crude form of client side permission checking
                can be enabled by specifying file_mode and dir_mode on
                the client.  Note that the mount.cifs helper must be
                at version 1.10 or higher to support specifying the uid
                (or gid) in non-numeric form.

	<title>SERVICE FORMATTING AND DELIMITERS</title>

	<para>
		It's generally preferred to use forward slashes (/) as a delimiter in service names. They are considered to be the "universal delimiter" since they are generally not allowed to be embedded within path components on Windows machines and the client can convert them to blackslashes (\) unconditionally. Conversely, backslash characters are allowed by POSIX to be part of a path component, and can't be automatically converted in the same way.
	</para>
	<para>
		mount.cifs will attempt to convert backslashes to forward slashes where it's able to do so, but it cannot do so in any path component following the sharename.

	<title>CONFIGURATION</title>
		<para>
The primary mechanism for making configuration changes and for reading 
debug information for the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem.
In the directory <filename>/proc/fs/cifs</filename> are various 
configuration files and pseudo files which can display debug information.  
There are additional startup options such as maximum buffer size and number
of buffers which only may be set when the kernel cifs vfs (cifs.ko module) is 
loaded.  These can be seen by running the modinfo utility against the file
cifs.ko which will list the options that may be passed to cifs during module
installation (device driver load).
For more information see the kernel file <filename>fs/cifs/README</filename>.

Note that the typical response to a bug report is a suggestion
to try the latest version first. So please try doing that first,
and always include which versions you use of relevant software
when reporting bugs (minimum: mount.cifs (try mount.cifs -V), kernel (see /proc/version) and
server type you are trying to contact.
