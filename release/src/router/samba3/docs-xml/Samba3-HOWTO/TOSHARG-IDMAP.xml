The Microsoft Windows operating system has a number of features that impose specific challenges
to interoperability with the operating systems on which Samba is implemented. This chapter deals
explicitly with the mechanisms Samba-3 (version 3.0.8 and later) uses to overcome one of the
key challenges in the integration of Samba servers into an MS Windows networking environment.
This chapter deals with identity mapping (IDMAP) of Windows security identifiers (SIDs)
to UNIX UIDs and GIDs.
</para>

<para>
To ensure sufficient coverage, each possible Samba deployment type is discussed.
This is followed by an overview of how the IDMAP facility may be implemented.

<indexterm><primary>default behavior</primary></indexterm>
The IDMAP facility is of concern where more than one Samba server (or Samba network client)
is installed in a domain. Where there is a single Samba server, do not be too concerned regarding
the IDMAP infrastructure &smbmdash; the default behavior of Samba is nearly always sufficient.
Where mulitple Samba servers are used it is often necessary to move data off one server and onto
another, and that is where the fun begins!

Where user and group account information is stored in an LDAP directory every server can have the same
consistent UID and GID for users and groups. This is achieved using NSS and the nss_ldap tool. Samba
can be configured to use only local accounts, in which case the scope of the IDMAP problem is somewhat
reduced. This works reasonably well if the servers belong to a single domain, and interdomain trusts
are not needed. On the other hand, if the Samba servers are NT4 domain members, or ADS  domain members,
or if there is a need to keep the security name-space separate (i.e., the user
<literal>DOMINICUS\FJones</literal> must not be given access to the account resources of the user 
<literal>FRANCISCUS\FJones</literal><footnote>Samba local account mode results in both
<literal>DOMINICUS\FJones</literal> and <literal>FRANCISCUS\FJones</literal> mapping to the UNIX user
<literal>FJones</literal>.</footnote> free from inadvertent cross-over, close attention should be given
to the way that the IDMAP facility is configured.

The use of IDMAP is important where the Samba server will be accessed by workstations or servers from
more than one domain, in which case it is important to run winbind so it can handle the resolution (ID mapping)
of foreign SIDs to local UNIX UIDs and GIDs.

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Server Types</primary></indexterm>
There are four basic server deployment types, as documented in <link linkend="ServerType">the chapter
on Server Types and Security Modes</link>.
</para>

	<sect2>
	<title>Standalone Samba Server</title>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>stand-alone server</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>Active Directory</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>NT4 Domain</primary></indexterm>
	A standalone Samba server is an implementation that is not a member of a Windows NT4 domain,
	a Windows 200X Active Directory domain, or a Samba domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>IDMAP</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>identity</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>local user</primary></indexterm>
	By definition, this means that users and groups will be created and controlled locally, and
	the identity of a network user must match a local UNIX/Linux user login. The IDMAP facility
	is therefore of little to no interest, winbind will not be necessary, and the IDMAP facility
	will not be relevant or of interest.
	</para>

	<title>Domain Member Server or Domain Member Client</title>

	<indexterm><primary>NT4</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>SID</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>Active Directory</primary></indexterm>
	Samba-3 can act as a Windows NT4 PDC or BDC, thereby providing domain control protocols that
	are compatible with Windows NT4. Samba-3 file and print sharing protocols are compatible with
	all versions of MS Windows products. Windows NT4, as with MS Active Directory,
	extensively makes use of Windows SIDs.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>MS Windows SID</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>UID</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>GID</primary></indexterm>
	Samba-3 domain member servers and clients must interact correctly with MS Windows SIDs. Incoming
	Windows SIDs must be translated to local UNIX UIDs and GIDs. Outgoing information from the Samba
	server must provide to MS Windows clients and servers appropriate SIDs.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>ADS</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>winbind</primary></indexterm>
	A Samba member of a Windows networking domain (NT4-style or ADS) can be configured to handle 
	identity mapping in a variety of ways. The mechanism it uses depends on whether or not
	the <command>winbindd</command> daemon is used and how the winbind functionality is configured.
	The configuration options are briefly described here:

				Where <command>winbindd</command> is not used Samba (<command>smbd</command>)
				uses the underlying UNIX/Linux mechanisms to resolve the identity of incoming
				network traffic. This is done using the LoginID (account name) in the
				session setup request and passing it to the getpwnam() system function call.
				This call is implemented using the name service switch (NSS) mechanism on
				modern UNIX/Linux systems. By saying "users and groups are local,"

				There are many sites that require only a simple Samba server or a single Samba
				server that is a member of a Windows NT4 domain or an ADS domain. A typical example
				is an appliance like file server on which no local accounts are configured and
				winbind is used to obtain account credentials from the domain controllers for the
				domain. The domain control can be provided by Samba-3, MS Windows NT4, or MS Windows
				Active Directory.

				<indexterm><primary>SID</primary></indexterm>
				Winbind is a great convenience in this situation. All that is needed is a range of
				UID numbers and GID numbers that can be defined in the &smb.conf; file. The
				<filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> file is configured to use <command>winbind</command>,
				which does all the difficult work of mapping incoming SIDs to appropriate UIDs and GIDs.
				The SIDs are allocated a UID/GID in the order in which winbind receives them.

				This configuration is not convenient or practical in sites that have more than one
				Samba server and that require the same UID or GID for the same user or group across
				all servers. One of the hazards of this method is that in the event that the winbind
				IDMAP file becomes corrupted or lost, the repaired or rebuilt IDMAP file may allocate
				UIDs and GIDs to different users and groups from what was there previously with the
				result that MS Windows files that are stored on the Samba server may now not belong to
				the rightful owners.

				The IDMAP_RID facility is new to Samba version 3.0.8. It was added to make life easier
				for a number of sites that are committed to use of MS ADS, that do not apply
				an ADS schema extension, and that do not have an installed an LDAP directory server just for
				the purpose of maintaining an IDMAP table. If you have a single ADS domain (not a forest of
				domains, and not multiple domain trees) and you want a simple cookie-cutter solution to the
				IDMAP table problem, then IDMAP_RID is an obvious choice.

				For example, if the <parameter>idmap uid</parameter> range is <constant>1000-100000000</constant>
				and the <parameter>idmap backend = idmap_rid:DOMAIN_NAME=1000-50000000</parameter>, and

				The use of the LDAP-based passdb backend requires use of the PADL nss_ldap utility or

				standalone Windows clients (i.e., not a member of our domain) as well as SIDs from 
				another domain. The foreign UID/GID is mapped from allocated ranges (idmap uid and idmap gid)

				The nss_ldap tool set can be used to access UIDs and GIDs via LDAP as well as via Active

				version 3.5 or later to extend the ADS schema so it maintains UNIX account credentials.
				Where the ADS schema is extended, a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in is also
				installed to permit the UNIX credentials to be set and managed from the ADS User and Computer
				Management tool. Each account must be separately UNIX-enabled before the UID and GID data can
				be used by Samba.

	<indexterm><primary>algorithmic mapping</primary></indexterm>
	Microsoft Windows domain security systems generate the user and group SID as part
	of the process of creation of an account. Windows does not have a concept of the UNIX UID or a GID; rather,
	it has its own type of security descriptor. When Samba is used as a domain controller, it provides a method
	of producing a unique SID for each user and group. Samba generates a machine and a domain SID to which it
	adds an RID that is calculated algorithmically from a base value that can be specified
	in the &smb.conf; file, plus twice (2x) the UID or GID. This method is called <quote>algorithmic mapping</quote>.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>RID base</primary></indexterm>
	For example, if a user has a UID of 4321, and the algorithmic RID base has a value of 1000, the RID will
	be <literal>1000 + (2 x 4321) = 9642</literal>. Thus, if the domain SID is
	<literal>S-1-5-21-89238497-92787123-12341112</literal>, the resulting SID is
	<literal>S-1-5-21-89238497-92787123-12341112-9642</literal>.

	The foregoing type of SID is produced by Samba as an automatic function and is either produced on the fly
	(as is the case when using a <parameter>passdb backend = [tdbsam | smbpasswd]</parameter>), or may be stored
	as a permanent part of an account in an LDAP-based ldapsam.

	ADS uses a directory schema that can be extended to accommodate additional

	IDMAP information can be written directly to the LDAP server so long as all domain controllers

	<indexterm><primary>IDMAP</primary></indexterm>
	The <command>idmap_rid</command> facility is a new tool that, unlike native winbind, creates a
	predictable mapping of MS Windows SIDs to UNIX UIDs and GIDs. The key benefit of this method
	of implementing the Samba IDMAP facility is that it eliminates the need to store the IDMAP data
	in a central place. The downside is that it can be used only within a single ADS domain and
	is not compatible with trusted domain implementations.
	</para>

	<indexterm><primary>allow trusted domains</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>idmap uid</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>idmap gid</primary></indexterm>
	This alternate method of SID to UID/GID  mapping can be achieved using the idmap_rid
        plug-in. This plug-in uses the RID of the user SID to derive the UID and GID by adding the
        RID to a base value specified. This utility requires that the parameter
        <quote>allow trusted domains = No</quote> be specified, as it is not compatible
        with multiple domain environments. The <parameter>idmap uid</parameter> and 
	<parameter>idmap gid</parameter> ranges must be specified.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>idmap_rid</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>realm</primary></indexterm>
	The idmap_rid facility can be used both for NT4/Samba-style domains and Active Directory.
	To use this with an NT4 domain, do not include the <parameter>realm</parameter> parameter; additionally, the
	method used to join the domain uses the <constant>net rpc join</constant> process.

	In a large domain with many users it is imperative to disable enumeration of users and groups.
	For example, at a site that has 22,000 users in Active Directory the winbind-based user and
	group resolution is unavailable for nearly 12 minutes following first startup of 
	<command>winbind</command>. Disabling enumeration resulted in instantaneous response.
	The disabling of user and group enumeration means that it will not be possible to list users
	or groups using the <command>getent passwd</command> and <command>getent group</command>
	commands. It will be possible to perform the lookup for individual users, as shown in the following procedure.

	The storage of IDMAP information in LDAP can be used with both NT4/Samba-3-style domains and
	ADS domains. OpenLDAP is a commonly used LDAP server for this purpose, although any
	standards-complying LDAP server can be used. It is therefore possible to deploy this IDMAP
	configuration using the Sun iPlanet LDAP server, Novell eDirectory, Microsoft ADS plus ADAM,
	and so on.
