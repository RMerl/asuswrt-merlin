#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
#
# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,
# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.
#
# Other terminfo and termcap files exist, supported by various OS vendors
# or as relics of various older versions of UNIX.  This one is the longest
# and most comprehensive one in existence.  It subsumes not only the entirety
# of the historical 4.4BSD, GNU, System V and SCO termcap files and the BRL
# termcap file, but also large numbers of vendor-maintained termcap and
# terminfo entries more complete and carefully tested than those in historical
# termcap/terminfo versions.
#
# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may
# be found at <http://www.tuxedo.org/terminfo>.
#
# INTERNATIONALIZATION:
#
# This file uses only the US-ASCII character set (no ISO8859 characters).
#
# This file assumes a US-ASCII character set. If you need to fix this, start
# by global-replacing \E(B and \E)B with the appropriate ISO 6429 enablers
# for your character set.  \E(A and \E)A enables the British character set
# with the pound sign at position 2/3.  
#
# In a Japanese-processing environment using EUC/Japanese or Shift-JIS,
# C1 characters are considered the first-byte set of the Japanese encodings,
# so \E)0 should be avoided in <enacs> and initialization strings.
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#
# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master
# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell
# which by the format given in the header above.
#
# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the
# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only
# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to
# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master
# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed "/OT[^,]*,/s///"'; but if
# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer (among other things, it automatically
# outputs entries in a canonical form).
#
# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version
# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their
# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the 1023-byte
# string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where explicitly
# noted below.  Note that the termcap translation assumes that your termcap
# library can handle multiple tc capabilities in an entry. 4.4BSD has this
# capability.  Older versions of GNU termcap, through 1.3, do not. 
#
# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,
# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD
# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources
# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.
#
# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),
# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation
# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field
# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).
#
# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor
# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of
# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered
# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.
#
# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by
# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information
# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware
# (notably DEC and Wyse).
#
# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.
#
# FILE ORGANIZATION:
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry (this feature had to be sacrificed in order
# to allow standard terminfo and termcap syntax to be generated cleanly from
# the master format).  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is
# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so
# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the
# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency from a linear
# search of the termcap form even if you don't use reorder).  Minor sections
# usually correspond to manufacturers or standard terminal classes. 
# Parenthesized words following manufacturer names are type prefixes or
# product line names used by that manufacturers.
#
# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:
#
# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or
# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for
# the terminal.
#
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the
# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used
# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,
# or user preferences.
#
# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used suffixes:
#	-2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	-am	Enable auto-margin.
#	-m	Monochrome.  Suppress color support
#	-mc	Magic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can
#		only support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.
#		Their base entry is usually paired with another that
#		uses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.
#	-nam	No auto-margin - suppress :am: capability
#	-nl	No labels - suppress soft labels
#	-ns	No status line - suppress status line
#	-rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	-s	Enable status line.
#	-vb	Use visible bell (:vb:) rather than :bl:.
#	-w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
# If a name has multiple suffixes and one is a line height, that one should 
# go first.  Thus `aaa-30-s-rv' is recommended over `aaa-s-rv-30'.  
# 
# Entries with embedded plus signs are designed to be included through use/tc
# capabilities, not used as standalone entries. 
#
# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have
# been removed (i.e., "33" for the Model 33 Teletype, "2621" for the HP2621).
# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.
#
# Comments marked "esr" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler
# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages. 
# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the
# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled
# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original
# entries is preserved in the comments.
#
# In the comments, terminfo capability names are bracketed with <> (angle
# brackets).  Termcap capability names are bracketed with :: (colons).
#
# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES
#
# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string
# capabilities for use by applications, <u0>...<u9>.   In this file, we use
# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered
# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:
#
#	u9	terminal enquire string (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 DA)
#	u8	terminal answerback description
#	u7	cursor position request (equiv. to VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48 DSR 6)
#	u6	cursor position report (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 CPR)
#
# The terminal enquire string <u9> should elicit an answerback response
# from the terminal.  Common values for <u9> will be ^E (on older ASCII
# terminals) or \E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# The cursor position request (<u7>) string should elicit a cursor position
# report.  A typical value (for VT100 terminals) is \E[6n.
#
# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected
# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like
# escapes:
#
#	%c	Accept any character
#	%[...]	Accept any number of characters in the given set
#
# The cursor position report (<u6>) string must contain two scanf(3)-style 
# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate
# and the second to the %d.  If the string contains the sequence %i, it is
# taken as an instruction to decrement each value after reading it (this is
# the inverse sense from the cup string).  The typical CPR value is
# \E[%i%d;%dR (on VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# These capabilities are used by tac(1m), the terminfo action checker
# (distributed with ncurses 5.0).
#
# TABSET FILES
#
# All the entries in this file have been edited to assume that the tabset
# files directory is /usr/share/tabset, in conformance with the File Hierarchy
# Standard for Linux and open-source BSD systems.  Some vendors (notably Sun)
# use /usr/lib/tabset or (more recently) /usr/share/lib/tabset.  
#
# No curses package we know of actually uses these files.  If their location
# is an issue, you will have to hand-patch the file locations before compiling
# this file.
# 
# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL
#
# As the ANSI/ECMA-48 standard and variants take firmer hold, and as
# character-cell terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of
# this file is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for
# the new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, Unix consoles,
# and vt100 up front in confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).
#
# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's
# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).
#
# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of
# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by
# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to
# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many
# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years
# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.
#
# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under
# `Miscellaneous obsolete terminals, manufacturers unknown' before the tribal
# wisdom about them gets lost.  If you know a lot about obscure old terminals,
# please go to the terminfo resource page, grab the UFO file (ufo.ti), and 
# eyeball it for things you can identify and describe. 
#
# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file
# with this in mind and send me your annotations.
#
# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they 
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool. 
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
# There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!

######## ANSI, UNIX CONSOLE, AND SPECIAL TYPES
#
# This section describes terminal classes and brands that are still
# quite common.
#

#### Specials
#
# Special "terminals".  These are used to label tty lines when you don't
# know what kind of terminal is on it.  The characteristics of an unknown
# terminal are the lowest common denominator - they look about like a ti 700.

# not to require any -- even at 9600 bps.  If you encounter problems,
# try including the padding specifications.
#
# Note: the :as: and :ae: specifications are not implemented here, for
# the available termcap documentation does not make clear WHICH alternate
# character set to specify.  ANSI 3.64 seems to make allowances for several.
# Please make the appropriate adjustments to fit your needs -- that is
# if you will be using alternate character sets.
#
# There are very few terminals running the full ANSI 3.64 standard,
# so I could only test this entry on one verified terminal (Visual 102).
# I would appreciate the results on other terminals sent to me.
#
# Please report comments, changes, and problems to:

# (For the terminfo master file, I translated these into terminfo syntax.
# Then I dropped all the pseudo-HP entries. we don't want and can't use
# the :Xs: flag. Then I split :is: into a size-independent :i1: and a
# size-dependent :is:.  Finally, I added <rmam>/<smam> -- esr)

# NOTE: :ic: has been taken out of this entry. for reference, it should
# be <ich1=\E[@>.  For discussion, see ICH/ICH1 VERSUS RMIR/SMIR below.
# (esr: added :vi: and :ve: to resolve NetBSD Problem Report #4583)

#### FreeBSD console entries
#
# From: Andrey Chernov <ache@astral.msk.su> 29 Mar 1996
# Andrey Chernov maintains the FreeBSD termcap distributions.
#
# Note: Users of FreeBSD 2.1.0 and older versions must either upgrade
# or comment out the :cb: capability in the console entry.
#
# Alexander Lukyanov reports:
# I have seen FreeBSD-2.1.5R... The old el1 bug changed, but it is still there.
# Now el1 clears not only to the line beginning, but also a large chunk
# of previous line. But there is another bug - ech does not work at all.
#

# for syscons
# common entry without semigraphics
# Bug: The <op> capability resets attributes.
# Bug? The ech and el1 attributes appear to move the cursor in some cases; for
# instance el1 does if the cursor is moved to the right margin first.  Removed
# by T.Dickey 97/5/3 (ech=\E[%p1%dX, el1=\E[1K)
#
# Setting colors turns off reverse; we cannot guarantee order, so use ncv.
# Note that this disables standout with color.

#### DEC VT100 and compatibles
#
# DEC terminals from the vt100 forward are collected here. Older DEC terminals
# and micro consoles can be found in the `obsolete' section.  More details on
# the relationship between the VT100 and ANSI X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 may be
# found near the end of this file.
#
# Except where noted, these entries are DEC's official terminfos.
# Contact Bill Hedberg <hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com> of Terminal Support
# Engineering for more information.  Updated terminfos and termcaps 
# are kept available at ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/termcaps.
#
# In October 1995 DEC sold its terminals business, including the VT and Dorio
# line and trademark, to SunRiver Data Systems.  SunRiver has since changed
# its name to Boundless Technologies; see http://www.boundless.com.
#

# NOTE:  Any VT100 emulation, whether in hardware or software, almost
# certainly includes what DEC called the `Level 1 editing extension' codes;
# only the very oldest VT100s lacked these and there probably aren't any of
# those left alive.  To capture these, use one of the VT102 entries.
#
# Note that the :xn: glitch in vt100 is not quite the same as on the Concept,
# since the cursor is left in a different position while in the
# weird state (concept at beginning of next line, vt100 at end
# of this line) so all versions of vi before 3.7 don't handle
# :xn: right on vt100. The correct way to handle :xn: is when
# you output the char in column 80, immediately output CR LF
# and then assume you are in column 1 of the next line. If :xn:
# is on, am should be on too.
# 
# I assume you have smooth scroll off or are at a slow enough baud
# rate that it doesn't matter (1200? or less). Also this assumes
# that you set auto-nl to "on", if you set it off use vt100-nam 
# below.
# 
# The padding requirements listed here are guesses. It is strongly
# recommended that xon/xoff be enabled, as this is assumed here.
# 
# The vt100 uses <rs2> and <rf> rather than :is:/:ct:/:st: because the 
# tab settings are in non-volatile memory and don't need to be 
# reset upon login. Also setting the number of columns glitches 
# the screen annoyingly. You can type "reset" to get them set.
#
# The VT100 series terminals have cursor ("arrows") keys which can operate
# in two different modes: Cursor Mode and Application Mode.  Cursor Mode
# is the reset state, and is assumed to be the normal state.  Application
# Mode is the "set" state.  In Cursor Mode, the cursor keys transmit
# "Esc [ {code}" sequences, conforming to ANSI standards.  In Application
# Mode, the cursor keys transmit "Esc O <code>" sequences.  Application Mode
# was provided primarily as an aid to the porting of VT52 applications.  It is
# assumed that the cursor keys are normally in Cursor Mode, and expected that
# applications such as vi will always transmit the :ks: string.  Therefore,
# the definitions for the cursor keys are made to match what the terminal
# transmits after the :ks: string is transmitted.  If the :ks: string
# is a null string or is not defined, then cursor keys are assumed to be in
# "Cursor Mode", and the cursor keys definitions should match that assumption,
# else the appication may fail.  It is also expected that applications will
# always transmit the :ke: string to the terminal before they exit.
#
# The VT100 series terminals have an auxilliary keypad, commonly referred to as
# the "Numeric Keypad", because it is a cluster of numeric and function keys.
# The Numeric Keypad which can operate in two different modes: Numeric Mode and
# Application Mode.  Numeric Mode is the reset state, and is assumed to be
# the normal state.  Application Mode is the "set" state.  In Numeric Mode,
# the numeric and punctuation keys transmit ASCII 7-bit characters, and the 
# Enter key transmits the same as the Return key (Note: the Return key
# can be configured to send either LF (\015) or CR LF).  In Application Mode,
# all the keypad keys transmit "Esc O {code}" sequences.  The PF1 - PF4 keys
# always send the same "Esc O {code}" sequences.  It is assumed that the keypad
# is normally in Numeric Mode.  If an application requires that the keypad be
# in Application Mode then it is expected that the user, or the application,
# will set the TERM environment variable to point to a terminfo entry which has
# defined the :ks: string to include the codes that switch the keypad into
# Application Mode, and the terminfo entry will also define function key
# fields to match the Application Mode control codes.  If the :ks: string
# is a null string or is not defined, then the keypad is assumed to be in
# Numeric Mode.  If the :ks: string switches the keypad into Application
# Mode, it is expected that the :ke: string will contain the control codes
# necessary to reset the keypad to "Normal" mode, and it is also expected that
# applications which transmit the :ks: string will also always transmit the
# :ke: string to the terminal before they exit.
#
# Here's a diagram of the VT100 keypad keys with their bindings.
# The top line is the name of the key (some DEC keyboards have the keys
# labelled somewhat differently, like GOLD instead of PF1, but this is
# the most "official" name).  The second line is the escape sequence it
# generates in Application Keypad mode (where "$" means the ESC
# character).  The third line contains two items, first the mapping of
# the key in terminfo, and then in termcap.

# vt220 termcap written Tue Oct 25 20:41:10 1988 by Alex Latzko
# (not an official DEC entry!)
# The problem with real vt220 terminals is they don't send escapes when in
# in vt220 mode.  This can be gotten around two ways.  1> don't send
# escapes or 2> put the vt220 into vt100 mode and use all the nifty
# features of vt100 advanced video which it then has.
#
# This entry takes the view of putting a vt220 into vt100 mode so
# you can use the escape key in emacs and everything else which needs it.
#
# You probably don't want to use this on a VMS machine since VMS will think
# it has a vt220 and will get fouled up coming out of emacs
#
# From: Alexander Latzko <latzko@marsenius.rutgers.edu>, 30 Dec 1996
# (Added vt100 :rc:,:sc: to quiet a tic warning -- esr)

# These entries are not DEC's official ones, they were purpose-built for the 
# VT320.  Here are the designer's notes:
# <kel> is end on a PC kbd.  Actually 'select' on a VT.  Mapped to 
# 'Erase to End of Field'... since nothing seems to use 'end' anyways...
# khome is Home on a PC kbd.  Actually 'FIND' on a VT.
# Things that use <knxt> usually use tab anyways... and things that don't use
# tab usually use <knxt> instead...
# kprv is same as tab - Backtab is useless...
# I left out :sa: because of its RIDICULOUS complexity,
# and the resulting fact that it causes the termcap translation of the entry
# to SMASH the 1k-barrier...
# From: Adam Thompson <athompso@pangea.ca> Sept 10 1995

#   which are pretty much a superset of the VT320.  They have the
#   host writable status line, yet another different DRCS matrix size,
#   and such, but they add the DEC Technical character set, Multiple text
#   pages, selectable length pages, and the like.  The difference between
#   the vt330 and vt340 is that the latter has only 2 planes and a monochrome
#   monitor, the former has 4 planes and a color monitor.  These terminals
#   support VT131 and ANSI block mode, but as with much of these things,
#   termcap/terminfo doesn't deal with these features.
#
# Note that this entry is are set up in what was the standard way for GNU
# Emacs v18 terminal modes to deal with the cursor keys in that the arrow
# keys were switched into application mode at the same time the numeric pad
# is switched into application mode.  This changes the definitions of the
# arrow keys.  Emacs v19 is smarter and mines its keys directly out of 
# your termcap or terminfo entry,

# VT400/420 -- This terminal is a superset of the vt320.  It adds the multiple 
#    text pages and long text pages with selectable length of the vt340, along
#    with left and right margins, rectangular area text copy, fill, and erase
#    operations, selected region character attribute change operations,

#    can only take advantage of a few of these added features.

#
# DEC VT220 and up support DECUDK (user-defined keys).  DECUDK (i.e., pfx)
# takes two parameters, the key and the string.  Translating the key is
# straightforward (keys 1-5 are not defined on real terminals, though some
# emulators define these):
#
#               if (key < 16) then  value = key;
#               else if (key < 21) then value = key + 1; 
#               else if (key < 25) then value = key + 2;
#               else if (key < 27) then value = key + 3;
#               else if (key < 30) then value = key + 4;
#               else value = key + 5;
#
# The string must be the hexadecimal equivalent, e.g., "5052494E" for "PRINT". 
# There's no provision in terminfo for emitting a string in this format, so the
# application has to know it.

# VT520/VT525
#
# The VT520 is a monochrome text terminal capable of managing up to
# four independent sessions in the terminal.  It has multiple ANSI
# emulations (VT520, VT420, VT320, VT220, VT100, VT PCTerm, SCO Console)
# and ASCII emulations (WY160/60, PCTerm, 50/50+, 150/120, TVI 950,
# 925 910+, ADDS A2).  This terminfo data is for the ANSI emulations only.
#
# Terminal Set-Up is entered by pressing [F3], [Caps Lock]/[F3] or
# [Alt]/[Print Screen] depending upon which keyboard and which
# terminal mode is being used.  If Set-Up has been disabled or
# assigned to an unknown key, Set-Up may be entered by pressing
# [F3] as the first key after power up, regardless of keyboard type.
# (vt520: I added <rmam>/<smam> based on the init string, also :sc: -- esr)

# This entry is for Tera Term Pro version 2.3, for MS-Windows 95/NT written by
# T. Teranishi dated Mar 10, 1998.  It is a free software terminal emulator
# (communication program) which supports:
#
#	- Serial port connections.
#	- TCP/IP (telnet) connections.
#	- VT100 emulation, and selected VT200/300 emulation.
#	- TEK4010 emulation.
#	- File transfer protocols (Kermit, XMODEM, ZMODEM, B-PLUS and
#	  Quick-VAN).
#	- Scripts using the "Tera Term Language".
#	- Japanese and Russian character sets.
#
# The program does not come with terminfo or termcap entries.  However, the
# emulation (testing with vttest and ncurses) is reasonably close to vt100 (no
# vt52 or doublesize character support; blinking is done with color).  Besides
# the HPA, VPA extensions it also implements CPL and CNL.
#
# All of the function keys can be remapped.  This description shows the default
# mapping, as installed.  Both vt100 PF1-PF4 keys and quasi-vt220 F1-F4 keys
# are supported.  F13-F20 are obtained by shifting F3-F10.  The editing keypad
# is laid out like vt220, rather than the face codes on the PC keyboard, i.e,
#	kfnd	Insert
#	kslt	Delete
#	kich1	Home
#	kdch1	PageUp
#	kpp	End
#	knp	PageDown
#
# ANSI colors are implemented, but cannot be combined with video attributes
# except for reverse.
#
# No fonts are supplied with the program, so the acsc string is chosen to
# correspond with the default Microsoft terminal font.
#
# Tera Term recognizes some xterm sequences, including those for setting and
# retrieving the window title, and for setting the window size (i.e., using
# "resize -s"), though it does not pass SIGWINCH to the application if the
# user resizes the window with the mouse.

#### X terminal emulators
#
# You can add the following line to your .Xdefaults to change the terminal type
# set by the xterms you start up to my-xterm:
#
# *termName:  my-xterm
#
# System administrators can change the default entry for xterm instances
# by adding a similar line to /usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.  In either
# case, xterm will detect and reject an invalid terminal type, falling back
# to the default of xterm.

# Notes:
# rxvt 2.21b uses
#	smacs=\E(B\E)U^N, rmacs=\E(B\E)0^O,
# but some applications don't work with that.
# It also has an AIX extension
#	box2=lqkxjmwuvtn,
# and
#	ech=\E[%p1%dX,
# but the latter does not work correctly.
#
# The distributed terminfo says it implements hpa and vpa, but they are not
# implemented correctly, using relative rather than absolute positioning.
#
# rxvt is normally configured to look for "xterm" or "xterm-color" as $TERM.
# Since rxvt is not really compatible with xterm, it should be configured as
# "rxvt" (monochrome) and "rxvt-color".

# From: Benjamin C. W. Sittler <bsittler@nmt.edu>
#
# I have a UNIX PC which I use as a terminal attached to my Linux PC.
# Unfortunately, the UNIX PC terminfo entry that comes with ncurses
# is broken. All the special key sequences are broken, making it unusable
# with Emacs. The problem stems from the following:
# 
# The UNIX PC has a plethora of keys (103 of them, and there's no numeric
# keypad!), loadable fonts, and strange highlighting modes ("dithered"
# half-intensity, "smeared" bold, and real strike-out, for example.) It also
# uses resizable terminal windows, but the bundled terminal program always
# uses an 80x24 window (and doesn't support seem to support a 132-column
# mode.) 
# 
# HISTORY: The UNIX PC was one of the first machines with a GUI, and used a
# library which was a superset of SVr3.5 curses (called tam, for "terminal
# access method".) tam includes support for real, overlapping windows,
# onscreen function key labels, and bitmap graphics. But since the primary
# user interface on the UNIX PC was a GUI program (ua, for "user
# assistant",) and remote administration was considered important for the
# machine, tam also supported VT100-compatible terminals attached to the
# serial port or used across the StarLan network. To simulate the extra keys
# not present on a VT100, users could press ESC and a two-letter sequence,
# such as u d (Undo) or U D (Shift-Undo.) These two-letter sequences,
# however, were not the same as those sent by the actual Undo key. The
# actual Undo key sends ESC 0 s unshifted, and ESC 0 S shifted, for example.
# (If you're interested in adding some of the tam calls to ncurses, btw, I
# have the full documentation and several programs which use tam. It also
# used an extended terminfo format to describe key sequences, special
# highlighting modes, etc.) 
# 
# KEYS: This means that ncurses would quite painful on the UNIX PC, since
# there are two sequences for every key-modifier combination (local keyboard
# sequence and remote "VT100" sequence.) But I doubt many people are trying
# to use ncurses on the UNIX PC, since ncurses doesn't properly handle the
# GUI. Unfortunately, the terminfo entry (and the termcap, too, I presume) 
# seem to have been built from the manual describing the VT100 sequences. 
# This means it doesn't work for a real live UNIX PC. 
# 
# FONTS: The UNIX PC also has a strange interpretation of "alternate
# character set". Rather than the VT100 graphics you might expect, it allows
# up to 8 custom fonts to be loaded at any given time. This means that
# programs expecting VT100 graphics will usually be disappointed. For this
# reason I have disabled the smacs/rmacs sequences, but they could easily be
# re-enabled. Here are the relevant control sequences (from the ESCAPE(7) 
# manpage), should you wish to do so: 
# 
# SGR10 - Select font 0 - ESC [ 10 m or SO
# SGR11 - Select font 1 - ESC [ 11 m or SI
# SGR12 - Select font 2 - ESC [ 12 m
# ... (etc.)
# SGR17 - Select font 7 - ESC [ 17 m
# 
# Graphics for line drawing are not reliably found at *any* character
# location because the UNIX PC has dynamically reloadable fonts. I use font
# 0 for regular text and font 1 for italics, but this is by no means
# universal. So ASCII line drawing is in order if smacs/rmacs are enabled.
# 
# MISC: The cursor visible/cursor invisible sequences were swapped in the
# distributed terminfo.
# 
# To ameliorate these problems (and fix a few highlighting bugs) I rewrote
# the UNIX PC terminfo entry. The modified version works great with Lynx,
# Emacs, and XEmacs running on my Linux PC and displaying on the UNIX PC
# attached by serial cable. In Emacs, even the Undo key works, and many
# applications can now use the F1-F8 keys. 
# 
# esr's notes:
#	Terminfo entry for the AT&T Unix PC 7300
#	from escape(7) in Unix PC 7300 Manual.
#	Somewhat similar to a vt100-am (but different enough

#### Iris consoles
#

# Sent by Stefan Stapelberg <stefan@rent-a-guru.de>, 24 Feb 1997, this is
# from SGI's terminfo database.  SGI's entry shows F9-F12 with the codes
# for the application keypad mode.  We have added iris-ansi-ap rather than
# change the original to keypad mode.
#
# (iris-ansi: added rmam/smam based on init string -- esr)
#
# This entry, and those derived from it, is used in xwsh (also known as
# winterm).  Some capabilities that do not fit into the terminfo model
# include the shift- and control-functionkeys:
#
# F1-F12 generate different codes when shift or control modifiers are used.
# For example:
#	F1      	\E[001q
#	shift F1	\E[013q
#	control-F1	\E[025q
#
# In application keypad mode, F9-F12 generate codes like vt100 PF1-PF4, i.e.,
# \EOP to \EOS.  The shifted and control modifiers still do the same thing.
#
# The cursor keys also have different codes:
#	control-up	\E[162q
#	control-down	\E[165q
#	control-left	\E[159q
#	control-right	\E[168q
#
#	shift-up	\E[161q

# Francesco Potorti <F.Potorti@cnuce.cnr.it>:
# NCSA telnet is one of the most used telnet clients for the Macintosh.  It has
# been maintained until recently by the National Center for Supercomputer
# Applications, and it is feature rich, stable and free.  It can be downloaded
# from www.ncsa.edu.  This terminfo description file is based on xterm-vt220,
# xterm+sl, and the docs at NCSA.  It works well.
#
# NCSA Telnet 2.6 for Macintosh in vt220 8-bit emulation mode
# The terminal options should be set as follows:
#         Xterm sequences ON
#         use VT wrap mode ON
#         use Emacs arrow keys OFF
#         CTRL-COMND is Emacs meta ON
#         8 bit mode ON
#         answerback string: "ncsa-vt220-8"
#         setup keys: all disabled
#
# Application mode is not used.
#
# Other special mappings:
#	Apple		VT220
#	HELP 		Find
#	HOME		Insert here
#	PAGEUP		Remove
#	DEL		Select
#	END		Prev Screen
#	PAGEDOWN	Next Screen
#
# Though it supports ANSI color, NCSA Telnet uses color to represent blinking
# text.
#
# The status-line manipulation is a mapping of the xterm-compatible control
# sequences for setting the window-title.  So you must use tsl and fsl in
# pairs, since the latter ends the string that is loaded to the window-title.

# QNX 4.0 Console
# Michael's original version of this entry had <am@>, :ti=\Ei:,
# :te=\Eh\ER:; this was so terminfo applications could write the lower

#### DOS ANSI.SYS variants
#
# This completely describes the sequences specified in the DOS 2.1 ANSI.SYS
# documentation (except for the keyboard key reassignment feature, which
# doen't fit the <pfkey> model well).  The klone+acs sequences were valid
# though undocumented.  The <pfkey> capability is untested but should work for
# keys F1-F10 (%p1 values outside this range will yield unpredictable results).

#
# Define IBM PC keypad keys for vi as per MS-Kermit while using ANSI.SYS.
# This should only be used when the terminal emulator cannot redefine the keys.
# Since redefining keys with ansi.sys also affects PC-DOS programs, the key
# definitions must be restored.  If the terminal emulator is quit while in vi
# or others using :ks:/:ke:, the keypad will not be defined as per PC-DOS.
# The PgUp and PgDn are prefixed with ESC so that tn3270 can be used on Unix
# (^U and ^D are already defined for tn3270).  The ESC is safe for vi but it
# does "beep".  ESC ESC i is used for Ins to avoid tn3270 ESC i for coltab.
# Note that :kl: is always BS, because PC-dos can tolerate this change.
# Caution: vi is limited to 256 string bytes, longer crashes or weirds out vi.
# Consequently the End keypad key could not be set (it is relatively safe and
# actually useful because it sends ^@ O, which beeps and opens a line above).

#### Windows NT
#
# This entry fits the Windows NT console when the _POSIX_TERM environment
# variable is set to 'on'.  While the Windows NT POSIX console is seldom used,
# the Telnet client supplied with both the Windows for WorkGroup 3.11 TCP/IP
# stack and the Win32 (i.e., Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.1 or later) operating
# systems is not, and (surprise!) they match very well.
#
# See:  MS Knowledge Base item Q108581, dated 13-MAY-1997, titled "Setting Up
# VI POSIX Editor for Windows NT 3.1".  True to Microsoft form, not only
# are the installation instructions a pile of mind-numbing bureaucratese,
# but the termcap entry is actually broken and unusable as given; the :do:
# capability is misspelled "d".
#
# To use this, you need to a bunch of environment variables: 
#
# SET _POSIX_TERM=on
# SET TERM=ansi
# SET TERMCAP=location of termcap file in POSIX file format
# which is case-sensitive.
# e.g. SET TERMCAP=//D/RESKIT35/posix/termcap
# SET TMP=//C/TEMP
#
# Important note: setting the TMP environment variable in POSIX style renders
# it incompatible with a lot of other applications, including Visual C++. So
# you should have a separate command window just for vi. All the other
# variables may be permanently set in the Control Panel\System applet. 
#
# You can find out more about the restrictions of this facility at
# <http://www.nentug.org/unix-to-nt/ntposix.htm>.

######## COMMON TERMINAL TYPES
#
# This section describes terminal classes and maker brands that are still
# quite common, but have proprietary command sets not blessed by ANSI.
#

#### Lear-Siegler (adm)
#
# These guys are long since out of the terminals business, but
# in 1995 many current terminals still have an adm type as one of their
# emulations (usually their stupidest, and usually labeled adm3, though
# these `adm3' emulations normally have adm3a+ capabilities).
#
# WARNING: Some early ADM terminals (including the ADM3 and ADM5) had a 
# `diagnostic feature' that sending them a ^G while pin 22 (`Ring Indicator')
# was being held to ground would trigger a send of the top line on the screen.
# A quick fix might be to drop back to a cheesy 4-wire cable with pin 22
# hanging in the air. (Thanks to Eric Fischer, <eric@fudge.uchicago.edu>,
# for clearing up this point.)

# Ctrl-U User friendly mode (normal setup)

# ADM-12+ supports hardware handshaking, but it is DTR/CTS as opposed to
# RTS/CTS used nowadays with virtually every modem and computer. 19200
# bps works fine with hardware flow control.
# 
# The following null-modem cable should fix this and enable you to use
# RTS/CTS handshaking (which Linux supports, use CRTSCTS setting). Also
# set ADM-12+ for DTR handshaking from supervisor setup.

#
# Qume was bought by Wyse, but still (as of early 1995) has its own support
# group and production division.
#
# Discontinued Qume models:
#
# The qvt101 and qvt102 listed here are long obsolete; so is the qvt101+
# built to replace them, and a qvt119+ which was a 101+ with available wide
# mode (132 columns).  There was a qvt103 which added vt100/vt131 emulations
# and an ANSI-compatible qvt203 that replaced it.  Qume started producing
# ANSI-compatible terminals with the qvt323 and qvt61.
#
# Current Qume models (as of February 1995):
#
# All current Qume terminals have ANSI-compatible operation modes.
# Qume is still producing the qvt62, which features emulations for other
# popular lines such as ADDS, and dual-host capabilities.  The qvt82 is
# designed for use as a SCO ANSI terminal.  The qvt70 is a color terminal
# with many emulations including Wyse370, Wyse 325, etc.  Their newest
# model is the qvt520, which is vt420-compatible.
#
# There are some ancient printing Qume terminals under `Daisy Wheel Printers'
#
# If you inherit a Qume without docs, try Ctrl-Shift-Setup to enter its
# setup mode.  Shift-s should be a configuration save to NVRAM.

# There are some tvi terminals that require incredible amounts of padding and
# some that don't.  I'm assuming tvi912 and tvi920 are the old slow ones, and
# tvi912b, tvi912c, tvi920b, tvi920c are the new ones that don't need padding.
#
# All of these terminals (912 to 970 and the tvipt) are discontinued.  Newer
# Televideo terminals are ANSI and PC-ANSI compatible.

# (tvi955: removed obsolete ":ma:=^Vj^Kk^Hh^Ll^^H";
# removed incorrect (and overridden) ":do=^J:"; fixed broken continuations in
# the :rs: string, inserted the :IC: implied by the termcap :ko: string.  Note
# the :ko: string had :cl: in it, which means that one of the original
# :cl=\E*:, <kclr=\EY> had to be wrong; set <kclr=\E*> because that's what
# the 950 has.   Finally, corrected the <kel> string to match the 950 and what
# ko implies -- esr)
# If the BSD termcap file was right, :cm=\E=%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c: would

# Visual 50 from Beau Shekita, BTL-Whippany <whuxlb!ejs>
# Recently I hacked together the following termcap for Visual
# Technology's Visual 50 terminal. It's a slight modification of
# the vt52 termcap. 
# It's intended to run when the Visual 50 is in vt52 emulation mode
# (I know what you're thinking; if it's emulating a vt52, then why
# another termcap? Well, it turns out that the Visual 50 can handle
# :dl: and db(?) among other things, which the vt52 can't)
# The termcap works OK for the most part. The only problem is on
# character inserts. The whole line gets painfully redrawn for each
# character typed. Any suggestions?
# Beau's entry is combined with the vi50 entry from University of Wisconsin.
# Note especially the :al: function.  :k4:-:k6: are really l4-l6 in
# disguise; :k7:-:k9: are really l1-l3.

#	Vox: (408)-473-1200
#	Fax: (408) 473-1222
#	Web: http://www.wyse.com
#
# Wyse sales can be reached by phone at 1-800-GET-WYSE.  Tech support is at
# (800)-800-WYSE (option 5 gets you a human).  There's a Web page at the
# obvious address, <http://www.wyse.com>.  They keep terminfo entries at
# <http://www.wyse.co.uk/support/appnotes/idxappnt.htm>.
#
# Wyse bought out Link Technology, Inc. in 1990 and closed it down in 1995.
# They now own the Qume and Amdek brands, too.  So these are the people to
# talk with about all Link, Qume, and Amdek terminals.
#
# These entries include a few small fixes.
# I canceled the bel capacities in the vb entries.
# I made two trivial syntax fixes in the wyse30 entry.
# I made some entries relative to adm+sgr.
#
#
# Note: The wyse75, wyse85, and wyse99 have been discontinued.

#	   Although the Wyse 30 can support more than one attribute
#	it requires magic cookies to do so.  Many applications do not
#	function well with magic cookies.  The following terminfo uses
#	the protect mode to support one attribute (dim) without cookies.
#	If more than one attribute is needed then the wy30-mc terminfo
#	should be used.

#	mix color with reverse, dim or underline.
#	    To further complicate things one of the attributes must be
#	black (either the foreground or the background).  In reverse video
#	the background changes color with black letters.  In normal video
#	the foreground changes colors on a black background.  
#	    This terminfo uses some of the more advanced features of curses
#	to display both color and blink.  In the final analysis I am not
#	sure that the wy350 runs better with this terminfo than it does
#	with the wy50 terminfo (with user adjusted colors).
#
#	The mandatory pause used by flash does not work with
#	older versions of terminfo.  If you see this effect then
#	unset xon and delete the / from the delay.
#	i.e. change $<100/> to $<100>
#
# Bug: The <op> capability resets attributes.

#
#	The Wyse 60 is like the Wyse 50 but with more padding.
#	The reset strings are slow and the pad times very depending
#	on other parameters such as font loading.  I have tried
#	to follow the following outline:
#
#		<rs1> -> set personality
#		<rs2> -> set number of columns
#		<rs3> -> set number of lines
#		:i1: -> select the proper font
#		:is: -> do the initialization
#		:i3: -> set up display memory (2 pages)
#
#	The Wyse 60's that have vt100 emulation are slower than the
#	older Wyse 60's.  This change happened mid-1987.
#	The capabilities effected are :dc: :dl: :al: :sf: :sr:
#
#	The meta key is only half right.  This terminal will return the
#	high order bit set when you hit CTRL-function_key
#
#	It may be useful to assign two function keys with the
#	values  \E=(\s  look at old data in page 1
#	        \E=W,   look at bottom of page 1
#	where \s is a space ( ).
#
#	Note:
#	   The Wyse 60 runs faster when the XON/XOFF
#	   handshake is turned off.
#
# (wy60: we use \E{ rather than ^^ for home (both are documented) to avoid
# a bug reported by Robert Dunn, <rcdii@inlink.com> -- esr)

#	The Wyse-99GT looks at lot like the Wyse 60 except that it
#	does not have the 42/43 line mode.  In the Wyse-60 the "lines"
#	setup parameter controls the number of lines on the screen.
#	For the Wyse 99GT the "lines" setup parameter controls the
#	number of lines in a page.  The screen can display 25 lines max.
#	    The Wyse-99GT also has personalities for the VT220 and
#	Tektronix 4014.  But this has no bearing on the native mode.
#
#	(msgr) should be set but the clear screen fails when in
#	alt-charset mode.  Try \EcE\s\s\E+\s if the screen is really clear
#	then set msgr, else use msgr@.
#
#	u0 -> enter Tektronix mode
#	u1 -> exit Tektronix mode

#
#	The Wyse 160 is combination of the WY-60 and the WY-99gt.
#	The reset strings are slow and the pad times very depending
#	on other parameters such as font loading.  I have tried
#	to follow the following outline:
#
#		<rs1> -> set personality
#		<rs2> -> set number of columns
#		<rs3> -> set number of lines
#		:i1: -> select the proper font
#		:is: -> do the initialization
#		:i3: -> set up display memory (2 pages)
#
#	The display memory may be used for either text or graphics.
#	When "Display Memory = Shared" the terminal will have more pages
#	but garbage may be left on the screen when you switch from
#	graphics to text.  If "Display Memory = Unshared" then the
#	text area will be only one page long.
#
# (wy160: we use \E{ rather than ^^ for home (both are documented) to avoid
# a bug reported by Robert Dunn, <rcdii@inlink.com> -- esr)

#	The Wyse 75 is a vt100 lookalike without advanced video.
#
#	   The Wyse 75 can support one attribute (e.g. Dim, Inverse,
#	Underline) without magic cookies.  The following description
#	uses this capability, but when more than one attribute is
#	put on the screen at once, all attributes will be changed
#	to be the same as the last attribute given.
#	   The Wyse 75 can support more attributes when used with magic
#	cookies.  The wy75-mc terminal description uses magic cookies
#	to correctly handle multiple attributes on a screen.

#	Wyse 85 emulating a vt220 7 bit mode.
#		24 line screen with status line.
#
#	The vt220 mode permits more function keys but it wipes out
#	the escape key.  I strongly recommend that <f11> be set to
#	escape (esc).
#	The terminal may have to be set for 8 data bits and 2 stop
#	bits for the arrow keys to work.
#	The Wyse 85 runs faster with XON/XOFF enabled.  Also the
#	:DC: and :IC: work best when XON/XOFF is set.  :IC: and
#	:DC: leave trash on the screen when used without XON/XOFF.

# Vendor-supplied Wyse entries end here.

# Can't set tabs! Other bugs (ANSI mode only):
# - can't redefine function keys (anyway, key redefinition in ANSI mode
#   is too much complex to be described);
# - meta key can't be described (the terminal forgets it when reset);
# The xon-xoff handshaking can't be disabled while in ansi personality, so
# emacs can't work at speed greater than 9600 baud.  No padding is needed at
# this speed.
#   dch1 has been commented out because it causes annoying glittering when
# vi deletes one character at the beginning of a line with tabs in it.
#   dch makes sysgen(1M) have a horrible behaviour when deleting
# a screen and makes screen(1) behave badly, so it is disabled too. The nice
# thing is that vi goes crazy if smir-rmir are present and both dch-dch1 are
# not, so smir and rmir are commented out as well.

# This terminal (firmware version 02) has a lot of bugs:
# - can't set tabs;
# - other bugs in ANSI modes (see above).
# This description disables handshaking when using cup. This is because
# GNU emacs doesn't like Xon-Xoff handshaking. This means the terminal
# cannot be used at speeds greater than 9600 baud, because at greater
# speeds handshaking is needed even for character sending. If you use
# DTR handshaking, you can use even greater speeds.

#TITLE:  TERMINFO ENTRY WY520
#DATE:   8/5/93
# The WY520 terminfo is based on the WY285 entry published on the WYSE 
# BBS with the addition of more function keys and special keys.
#
#               rs1 -> set personality
#               rs2 -> set number of columns
#               rs3 -> set number of lines
#               is1 -> select the proper font
#               is2 -> do the initialization
#               is3 -> If this string is empty then rs3 gets sent.
#
#       Wyse 520 emulating a vt420 7 bit mode with default ANSI keyboard
#       - The BS key is programmed to generate BS in smcup since
#         is2 doesn't seem to work.
#       - Remove and shift/Remove: delete a character
#       - Insert : enter insert mode
#       - Find   : delete to end of file
#       - Select : clear a line
#       - F11, F12, F13: send default sequences (not ESC, BS, LF)
#       - F14 : Home key
#       - Bottom status line (host writable line) is used.
#       - smkx,rmkx are removed because this would put the numeric
#         keypad in Dec application mode which doesn't seem to work
#         with SCO applications.

# From: Kevin Turner <kevint@aracnet.com>, 12 Jul 1998
# This copes with an apparent firmware bug in the wy85.  He writes:
# "What I did was change leave the terminal cursor keys set to Normal
# (instead of application), and change \E[ to \233 for all the keys in
# terminfo. At one point, I found some reference indicating that this
# terminal bug (not sending \E[) was acknowledged by Wyse (so it's not just
# me), but I can't find that and the server under my bookmark to "Wyse 
# Technical" isn't responding.  So there's the question of wether the wy85
# terminfo should reflect the manufactuer's intended behaviour of the terminal
# or the actual."

######## ---------------- TERMINFO FILE CAN BE SPLIT HERE -------------------
# This cut mark helps make life less painful for people running ncurses tic
# on machines with relatively little RAM.  The file can be broken in half here
# cleanly and compiled in sections -- no `use' references cross this cut
# going forward.
#

######## OLDER TERMINAL TYPES
#
# This section is devoted to older commercial terminal brands that are now
# discontinued, but known to be still in use or represented by emulations.
#

#### AT&T (att, tty)
#
# This section also includes Teletype-branded VDTs.
#
# The AT&T/Teletype terminals group was sold to SunRiver Data Systems (now
# Boundless Technologies); for details, see the header comment on the ADDS
# section.
#
# These are AT&T's official terminfo entries.  All-caps aliases have been
# removed.

# This is the att700 entry for 700 native emulation of the AT&T 700
# terminal.  Comments are relative to changes from the 605V2 entry and
# att730 on which the entry is based.  Comments show the terminfo
# capability name, termcap name, and description.
#
# Here is what's going onm in the init string:
#	ESC [ 50;4|	set 700 native mode (really is 605)
# x	ESC [ 56;ps| 	set lines to 24: ps=0; 40: ps=1 (plus status line)
#	ESC [ 53;0|	set GenFlow to Xon/Xoff
#	ESC [ 8 ;0|	set CR on NL 
# x	ESC [ ? 3 l/h	set workspace: 80 col(l); 132 col(h)
#	ESC [ ? 4 l	jump scroll 
#	ESC [ ? 5 l/h	video: normal (l); reverse (h)
#	ESC [ ?13 l	Labels on
#	ESC [ ?15 l	parity check = no
#	ESC [ 13 l	monitor mode off
#	ESC [ 20 l	LF on NL (not CRLF on NL)
#	ESC [ ? 7 h	autowrap on
#	ESC [ 12 h	local echo off
#	ESC ( B		GO = ASCII
#	ESC ) 0		G1 = Special Char & Line Drawing
#	ESC [ ? 31 l	Set 7 bit controls
#
# Note: Most terminals, especially the 600 family use Reverse Video for
# standout mode.  DEC also uses reverse video.  The VT100 uses bold in addition
# Assume we should stay with reverse video for 70..  However, the 605V2 exits
# standout mode with \E[m (all normal attributes).  The 730 entry simply
# exits reverse video which would leave other current attributes intact.  It
# was assumed the 730 entry to be more correct so rmso has changed.  The
# 605V2 has no sequences to turn individual attributes off, thus its setting
# and the rmso/smso settings from the 730.
#
# Note: For the same reason as above in rmso I changed exit under-score mode
# to specifically turn off underscore, rather than return to all normal 
# attributes
#
# Note: The following pkey_xmit is taken from the 605V2 which contained the
# capability as pfxl.  It was changed here to pfx since pfxl
# will only compile successfully with Unix 4.0 tic.  Also note that pfx only
# allows strings to be parameters and label values must be programmed as
# constant strings.  Supposedly the pfxl of Version 4.0 allows both labels
# and strings to be parameters.  The 605V2 pfx entry should be examined later
# in this regard. For reference the 730 pfxl entry is shown here for comparison
# 730 pfx entry:
#     pfxl=\E[%?%p1%{25}%<%t%p1%e%p1%{24}%-%;%d;%p2%l%02d%?%p1%{25}%<%tq\s\s\s
# SYS\s\s\s\s\sF%p1%:-2d\s\s%e;0;3q%;%p2%s,
#
# (for 4.0 tic)
#     pfxl=\E[%p1%d;%p2%l%02dq%?%p1%{9}%<%t   F%p1%1d           %;%p2%s,

# This entry was modified 3/13/90 by JWE.
# fixes include additions of <enacs>, correcting :rp:, and modification
# of <kHOM>.  (See comments below)
# att730 has status line of 80 chars
# These were commented out: :SF=\E[%p1%dS:, :SR=\E[%p1%dT:,
# the <kf25> and up keys are used for shifted system Fkeys
# NOTE: JWE 3/13/90 The 98 key keyboard translation for shift/HOME is 
# currently the same as :kh: (unshifted HOME or \E[H).  On the 102, 102+1
# and 122 key keyboards, the 730's translation is \E[2J.  For consistency
# <kHOM> has been commented out.  The user can uncomment <kHOM> if using the
# 102, 102+1, or 122 key keyboards
#       kHOM=\E[2J,
# (att730: I added <rmam>/<smam> based on the init string -- esr)

#### Ann Arbor (aa)
#
# Ann Arbor made dream terminals for hackers -- large screen sizes and huge
# numbers of function keys.  At least some used monitors in portrait mode,
# allowing up to 76-character screen heights!  They were reachable at:
#
#	Ann Arbor Terminals
#	6175 Jackson Road
#	Ann Arbor, MI 48103
#	(313)-663-8000
#
# But in 1996 the phone number reaches some kitschy retail shop, and Ann Arbor
# can't be found on the Web; I fear they're long dead.  R.I.P.
#


# Originally from Mike O'Brien@Rand and Howard Katseff at Bell Labs.
# Highly modified 6/22 by Mike O'Brien.
# split out into several for the various screen sizes by dave-yost@rand
# Modifications made 3/82 by Mark Horton
# Modified by Tom Quarles at UCB for greater efficiency and more diversity
# status line moved to top of screen, :vb: removed 5/82
# Some unknown person at SCO then hacked the init strings to make them more
# efficient.
#
# assumes the following setup:
#   A menu: 0000 1010  0001 0000
#   B menu: 9600  0100 1000  0000 0000  1000 0000  17  19

#	Briefly, the settings are for the following modes:

#### Applied Digital Data Systems (adds)
#
# ADDS itself is long gone.  ADDS was bought by NCR, and the same group made
# ADDS and NCR terminals.  When AT&T and NCR merged, the engineering for
# terminals was merged again.  Then AT&T sold the terminal business to
# SunRiver, which later changed its  name to Boundless Technologies.  The
# engineers from Teletype, AT&T terminals, ADDS, and NCR (who are still there
# as of early 1995) are at:
#
#	Boundless Technologies
#	100 Marcus Boulevard
#	Hauppauge, NY 11788-3762
#	Vox: (800)-231-5445
#	Fax: (516)-342-7378
#	Web: http://boundless.com
#
# Their voice mail used to describe the place as "SunRiver (formerly ADDS)". 
# In 1995 Boundless acquired DEC's terminals business.  
#

# Regent: lowest common denominator, works on all regents.

# Beehive documentation is undated and marked Preliminary and has no figures
# so we must have early Superbee2 (Model 600, according to phone conversation
# with mfr.). It has proved reliable except for some missing padding
# (notably after \EK and <nl> at bottom of screen).
# 
# The key idea is that AEP mode is poison for :cm: & that US's in 
# the local memory should be avoided like the plague. That means 
# that the 2048 character local buffer is used as 25 lines of 80 
# characters, period. No scrolling local memory, folks. It also 
# appears that we cannot use naked INS LINE feature since it uses
# US. The sbi fakes :al: with an 80-space insert that may be too 
# slow at low speeds; also spaces get converted to \040 which is 
# too long for some programs (not vi).  DEL LINE is ok but slow.
# 
# The <nl> string is designed for last line of screen ONLY; cup to 
# 25th line corrects the motion inherent in scrolling to Page 1.
# 
# There is one understood bug. It is that the screen appears to
# pop to a new (blank) page after a :nw:, or leave a half-line 
# ellipsis to a quad that is the extra 48 memory locations. The 
# data received is dumped into memory but not displayed.  Not to 
# worry if :cm: is being used; the lines not displayed will be, 
# whenever the cursor is moved up there. Since :cm: is addressed 
# relative to MEMORY of window, nothing is lost; but beware of 
# relative cursor motion (:up:,:do:,:nd:,:le:). Recommended,
# therefore, is setenv MORE -c .
# 
# WARNING: Not all features tested.
# 
# Timings are assembled from 3 sources. Some timings may reflect 
# SB2/Model 300 that were used if more conservative.
# Tested on a Model 600 at 1200 and 9600 bd.
# 
# The BACKSPACEkb option is cute. The NEWLINE key, so cleverly 
# placed on the keyboard and useless because of AEP, is made 
# into a backspace key. In use ESC must be pressed twice (to send)
# and sending ^C must be prefixed by ESC to avoid that weird 
# transmit mode associated with ENTER key.
# 
# IF TERMINAL EVER GOES CATATONIC with the cursor buzzing across 
# the screen, then it has dropped into ENTER mode; hit 
# RESET--ONLINE--!tset.
# 
# As delivered this machine has a FATAL feature that will throw 
# it into that strange transmit state (SPOW) if the space bar is 
# hit after a CR is received, but before receiving a LF (or a 
# few others).
# 
# The circuits MUST be modified to eliminate the SPOW latch. 
# This is done by strapping on chip A46 of the I/O board; cut 
# the p.c. connection to Pin 5 and strap Pin 5 to Pin 8 of that 
# chip. This mod has been checked out on a Mod 600 of Superbee II.
# With this modification absurdly high timings on cr are 
# unnecessary.
# 
# NOTE WELL that the rear panel switch should be set to CR/LF, 
# not AEP!

# late 1980's CIT Terminals went out of business.
# There is no need to use the initialization string is=... (by invoking
# tset or setterm etc.) provided that the terminal has been manually set
# up (and the setup saved with ^S) to be compatible with this termcap.  To be
# compatible it should be in ANSI mode (not VT52).   A set-up that
# works is to set all the manually setable stuff to factory defaults
# by pressing ^D in set-up mode.  Then increse the brighness with the
# up-arrow key since the factory default will likely be dim on an old
# terminal.  Then change any options you want (provided that they are
# compatible with the termcap).  For my terminal I set: Screen
# Background: light; Keyclicks: silent; Auto wraparound: on; CRT saver:
# on.  I also set up mine for parity (but you may not need it).  Then 
# save the setup with ^S.

#### Getronics
#
# Getronics is a Dutch electronics company that at one time was called 
# `Geveke' and made async terminals; but (according to the company itself!)
# they've lost all their documentation on the command set.  The hardware
# documentation suggests the terminals were actually manufactured by a
# Taiwanese electronics company named Cal-Comp.  There are known
# to have been at least two models, the 33 and the 50.
#

# The 50 seems to be a top end vt220 clone, with the addition of a higher
# screen resolution, a larger screen, at least 1 page of memory above and
# below the screen, apparently pages of memory right and left of the screen
# which can be panned, and about 75 function keys (15 function keys x normal,
# shift, control, func A, func B). It also has more setup possibilities than
# the vt220. The monitor case is dated November 1978 and the keyboard case is
# May 1982.
#
# The vt100 emulation works as is.  The entry below describes the rather
# non-conformant (but more featureful) ANSI mode.

# Extensive changes to c108 by arpavax:eric Feb 1982
# Some unknown person at SCO then translated it to terminfo.
#
# There seem to be a number of different versions of the C108 PROMS
# (with bug fixes in its Z-80 program).
# 
# The first one that we had would lock out the keyboard of you
# sent lots of short lines (like /usr/dict/words) at 9600 baud.
# Try that on your C108 and see if it sends a ^S when you type it.
# If so, you have an old version of the PROMs.
# 
# You should configure the C108 to send ^S/^Q before running this.
# It is much faster (at 9600 baud) than the c100 because the delays
# are not fixed.
# new status line display entries for c108-8p:
# :i3: - init str #3 - setup term for status display - 
# set programmer mode, select window 2, define window at last 
# line of memory, set bkgnd stat mesg there, select window 0.
# 
# :ts: - to status line - select window 2, home cursor, erase to 
# end-of-window, 1/2 bright on, goto(line#0, col#?)
# 
# :fs: - from status line - 1/2 bright off, select window 0
# 
# :ds: - disable status display - set bkgnd status mesg with 
# illegal window #
# 
# There are probably more function keys that should be added but 
# I don't know what they are.
#
# No delays needed on c108 because of ^S/^Q handshaking

# Concept 100:
# These have only window relative cursor addressing, not screen 
# relative. To get it to work right here, smcup/rmcup (which 
# were invented for the concept) lock you into a one page 
# window for screen style programs.
# 
# To get out of the one page window, we use a clever trick:
# we set the window size to zero ("\Ev    " in rmcup) which the 
# terminal recognizes as an error and resets the window to all 
# of memory.
# 
# This trick works on c100 but does not on c108, sigh.
# 
# Some tty drivers use cr3 for concept, others use nl3, hence 
# the delays on cr and ind below. This padding is only needed at 
# 9600 baud and up.  One or the other is commented out depending on 
# local conventions.
# 
# 2 ms padding on :te: isn't always enough. 6 works fine. Maybe 
# less than 6 but more than 2 will work.
# 
# Note: can't use function keys f7-f10 because they are 
# indistinguishable from arrow keys (!), also, del char and 
# clear eol use xon/xoff so they probably won't work very well.
# 
# Also note that we don't define insrt/del char/delline/eop/send 
# because they don't transmit unless we reset them - I figured 
# it was a bad idea to clobber their definitions.
# 
# The <mc5> sequence changes the escape character to ^^ so that 
# escapes will be passed through to the printer. Only trouble 
# is that ^^ won't be - ^^ was chosen to be unlikely. 
# Unfortunately, if you're sending raster bits through to be 
# plotted, any character you choose will be likely, so we lose.
#
# \EQ"\EY(^W (send anything from printer to host, for xon/xoff) 
# cannot be # in is2 because it will hang a c100 with no printer 
# if sent twice.

# From: Walter Skorski <walt@genetics1.JMP.TJU.EDU>, 16-oct-1996.
# Lots of notes, originally inline, but ncurses doesn't grok that.
#
# am: 	not available in power on mode, but turned on with \E[=107;207h in
#	is2=.  Also, \E=124l in is2= could have been used to prevent needing
#	to specify xenl:, but that would have rendered the last space on the
#	last line useless.
# bw:	Not available in power on mode, but turned on with \E[=107;207h in
#	is2=.
# clear: Could be done with \E[2J alone, except that vi (and probably most
#	other programs) assume that this also homes the cursor.
# dsl:	Go to window 2, go to the beginning of the line, use a line feed to
#	scroll the window, and go back to window 1.
# is2:	the string may cause a warning to be issued by tic that it
#	found a very long line and that it suspects that a comma is missing
#	somewhere.  This warning can be ignored (unless it comes up more than
#	once).  The initialization string contains the following commands:
#
#	 [Setup mode items changed from factory defaults:]
#		\E)0			set alternate character set to
#						graphics
#		^O			set character set to default
#	 [In case it wasn't]
#		\E[m			turn off all attributes
#	 [In case they weren't off]
#		\E[=107;		cursor wrap and
#			207h			character wrap on
#		\E[90;3u		set Fkey definitions to "transmit"
#						defaults
#		\E[92;3u		set cursor key definitions to
#						"transmit" defaults
#		\E[43;1u		set shift F13 to transmit...
#		\177\E$P\177
#		\E[44;1u		set shift F14 to transmit...
#			\177\E$Q\177
#		\E[45;1u		set shift F15 to transmit...
#			\177\E$R\177
#		\E[46;1u		set shift F16 to transmit...
#			\177\E$S\177
#		\E[200;1u		set shift up to transmit...
#			\177\E$A\177
#		\E[201;1u		set shift down to transmit...
#			\177\E$B\177
#		\E[202;1u		set shift right to transmit...
#			\177\E$C\177
#		\E[203;1u		set shift left to transmit...
#			\177\E$D\177
#		\E[204;1u		set shift home to transmit...
#			\177\E$H\177
#		\E[212;1u		set backtab to transmit...
#			\177\E$I\177
#		\E[213;1u		set shift backspace to transmit...
#			\177\E$^H\177
#		\E[214;1u		set shift del to transmit...
#			"\E$\177"
#	 [Necessary items not mentioned in setup mode:]
#		\E[2!w			move to window 2
#		\E[25;25w		define window as line 25 of memory
#		\E[!w			move to window 1
#		\E[2*w			show current line of window 2 as
#						status line
#		\E[2+x			set meta key to use high bit
#		\E[;3+}			move underline to bottom of character
#
#	All Fkeys are set to their default transmit definitions with \E[90;3u
#	in is2=.  IMPORTANT:  to use this terminal definition, the "quit" stty
#	setting MUST be redefined or deactivated, because the default is
#	contained in almost all of this terminal's Fkey strings!  If for some
#	reason "quit" cannot be altered, the Fkeys can, but it would be
#	necessary to change ^| to ^] in all of these definitions, and add
#	\E[2;029!t to is2.
# lines: is set to 24 because this terminal refuses to treat the 25th
#	line normally.
# ll:	Not available in power on mode, but turned on with \E[=107;207h in
#	is2=.
# lm:	Pointless, given that this definition locks a single screen of
#	memory into view, but what the hey...
# rmso: Could use \E[1;7!{ to turn off only bold and reverse (leaving any
#	other attributes alone), but some programs expect this to turn off
#	everything.
# rmul: Could use \E[4!{ to turn off only underline (leaving any other
#	attributes alone), but some programs expect this to turn off
#	everything.
# sgr:	Attributes are set on this terminal with the string \E[ followed by
#	a list of attribute code numbers (in decimal, separated by
#	semicolons), followed by the character m.  The attribute code
#	numbers are:
#		  1 for bold;
#		  2 for dim (which is ignored in power on mode);
#		  4 for underline;
#		  5 for blinking;
#		  7 for inverse;
#		  8 for not displayable; and
#		=99 for protected (except that there are strange side
#		effects to protected characters which make them inadvisable).
#	 The mapping of terminfo parameters to attributes is as follows:
#		%p1 (standout) = bold and inverse together;
#		%p2 (underline) = underline;
#		%p3 (reverse) = inverse;
#		%p4 (blink) = blinking;
#		%p5 (dim) is ignored;
#		%p6 (bold) = bold;
#		%p7 (invisible) = not displayable;
#		%p8 (protected) is ignored; and
#		%p9 (alt char set) = alt char set.
#	 The code to do this is:
#		\E[0		OUTPUT	\E[0
#		%?%p1%p6%O	IF	(standout; bold) OR
#		%t;1		THEN	OUTPUT	;1
#		%;		ENDIF
#		%?%p2		IF	underline
#		%t;4		THEN	OUTPUT	;4
#		%;		ENDIF
#		%?%p4		IF	blink
#		%t;5		THEN	OUTPUT	;5
#		%;		ENDIF
#		%?%p1%p3%O	IF	(standout; reverse) OR
#		%t;7		THEN	OUTPUT	;7
#		%;		ENDIF
#		%?%p7		IF	invisible
#		%t;8		THEN	OUTPUT	;8
#		%;		ENDIF
#		m		OUTPUT	m
#		%?%p9		IF	altcharset
#		%t^N		THEN	OUTPUT	^N
#		%e^O		ELSE	OUTPUT	^O
#		%;		ENDIF
# sgr0: Everything is turned off (including alternate character set), since
#	there is no way of knowing what it is that the program wants turned
#	off.
# smul: The "underline" attribute is reconfigurable to an overline or
#	strikethru, or (as done with \E[;3+} in is2=), to a line at the true
#	bottom of the character cell.  This was done to allow for more readable

#------- flash=\E[8;3!}^G\E[3;3!}
#------- flash=\E[?5h$<100>\E[?5l
# There are two ways to flash the screen, both of which have their drawbacks. 
# The first is to set the bell mode to video, transmit a bell character, and
# set the bell mode back - but to what?  There is no way of knowing what the
# user's old bell setting was before we messed with it.  Worse, the command to
# set the bell mode also sets the key click volume, and there is no way to say
# "leave that alone", or to know what it's set to, either.
# The second way to do a flash is to set the screen to inverse video, pad for a
# tenth of a second, and set it back - but like before, there's no way to know
# that the screen wasn't ALREADY in inverse video, or that the user may prefer
# it that way.  The point is moot anyway, since vi (and probably other
# programs) assume that by defining flash=, you want the computer to use it
# INSTEAD of bel=, rather than as a secondary type of signal.
#
#------- cvvis=\E[+{
# The is the power on setting, which is also as visible as the cursor
# gets.
#-------  wind=\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%d;%p3%{1}%+%d;%p4%{1}%+%dw
# Windowing is possible, but not defined here because it is also used to
# emulate status line functions.  Allowing a program to set a window could
# clobber the status line or render it unusable.  There is additional memory,
# but screen scroll functions are destructive and do not make use of it.
#
#-------   dim=			Not available in power on mode.
# You have a choice of defining low intensity characters as "half bright" and
# high intensity as "normal", or defining low as "normal" and high as "bold". 
# No matter which you choose, only one of either "half bright" or "bold" is
# available at any time, so taking the time to override the default is
# pointless.
#
#-------  prot=\E[=0;99m
# Not defined, because it appears to have some strange side effects.

#		%p1%{30}%>		 ((key; 30) >;
#		%p1%{54}%<		  (key; 54) <

#		%p1%d			OUTPUT	(key) as decimal
#	 [next line applies to pfx only]
#		;1			OUTPUT	;1

#		\177			OUTPUT	\177
#		%p2%s			OUTPUT	(string) as string

# Not defined since anything it might do could be done faster and easier with
# either Meta-Shift-Reset or the main power switch.
#
#-------  smkx=\E[1!z
#-------  rmkx=\E[!z
# These sequences apply to the cursor and setup keys only, not to the
# numeric keypad.  But it doesn't matter anyway, since making these
# available to programs is inadvisable.
# For the key definitions below, all sequences beginning with \E$ are
# custom and programmed into the terminal via is2.  \E$ also has no
# meaning to any other terminal.
#
#------- cmdch=\E[;%p1%d!t
# Available, but making it available to programs is inadvisable.
#------- smxon=\E[1*q
# Available, but making it available to programs is inadvisable.
# Terminal will send XON/XOFF on buffer overflow.
#------- rmxon=\E[*q
# Available, but making it available to programs is inadvisable.
# Terminal will not notify on buffer overflow.
#-------   smm=\E[2+x
#-------   rmm=\E[+x
# Available, but making them available to programs is inadvisable.
#
# Printing:
#	 It's not made clear in the manuals, but based on other ansi/vt type
#	 terminals, it's a good guess that this terminal is capable of both
#	 "transparent print" (which doesn't copy data to the screen, and
#	 therefore needs mc5i: specified to say so) and "auxilliary print"
#	 (which does duplicate printed data on the screen, in which case mc4=
#	 and mc5= should use the \E[?4i and \E[?5i strings instead).
#
# (esr: I have commented out is2 in order to avoid overflowing termcap's
# 1024-byte limit.)

#### Data General (dg)
#
# According to James Carlson <carlson@xylogics.com> writing in January 1995,
# the terminals group at Data General was shut down in 1991; all these
# terminals have thus been discontinued.
#
# DG terminals have function keys that respond to the SHIFT and CTRL keys,
# e.g., SHIFT-F1 generates a different code from F1.  To number the keys
# sequentially, first the unmodified key codes are listed as F1 through F15. 
# Then their SHIFT versions are listed as F16 through F30, their CTRL versions
# are listed as F31 through F45, and their CTRL-SHIFT versions are listed as
# F46 through F60.  This is done in the private "includes" below whose names
# start with "dgkeys+".
#
# DG terminals generally support 8 bit characters.  For each of these terminals
# two descriptions are supplied:
#	1) A default description for 8 bits/character communications, which
#	   uses the default DG international character set and keyboard codes.
#	2) A description with suffix "-7b" for 7 bits/character communications.
#	   This description must use the NON-DEFAULT native keyboard language.

# Unmodified fkeys (kf1-kf11), Shift fkeys (kf12-kf22), Ctrl fkeys (kf23-kf33),
# Ctrl/Shift fdkeys (kf34-kf44).

# Most of these entries are `official' and came from DG.  Others are marked.

# Not official...
# Note: lesser Dasher terminals will not work with vi because vi insists upon
# having a command to move straight down from any position on the bottom line
# and scroll the screen up, or a direct vertical scroll command.  The 460 and
# above have both, the D210/211, for instance, has neither.  We must use ANSI
# mode rather than DG mode because standard UNIX tty drivers assume that ^H is
# backspace on all terminals.  This is not so in DG mode.
# (dg460-ansi: removed obsolete ":kn#6:"; also removed ":mu=\EW:", on the
# grounds that there is no matching ":ml:"
# fixed garbled ":k9=\E[00\:z:" capability -- esr)

# DASHER D578 terminal.
# Like a D577, but without compressed mode; like a D470C in this respect.
#
# Initialization string 1 sets:
#	\E[<0;<1;<2;<4l
#		<0	- scrolling enabled
#		<1	- blink enabled
#		<2	- horizontal scrolling enabled (for alignment)
#		<4	- print characters regardless of attributes
#	\E[1;1;80w	- margins at columns 1 and 80
#	\E[1;6;<2h
#		1	- print all characters even if protected
#		6	- character protection disabled
#		<2	- horizontal scrolling disabled
#	- (should reset scrolling regions, but that glitches the screen)

# Datamedia was headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire until it went

# Datamedia Excel 62, 64 from Gould/SEL UTX/32 via BRL
# These aren't end-all Excel termcaps; but do insert/delete char/line
# and name some of the extra function keys.  (Mike Feldman ccvaxa!feldman)
# The naming convention has been bent somewhat, with the use of E? (where
# E is for 'Excel') as # a name.  This was done to distinguish the entries
# from the other Datamedias in use here, and yet to associate a model of
# the Excel terminals with the regular datamedia terminals that share
# major characteristics.

#### Hazeltine
#
# Hazeltine appears to be out of the terminal business as of 1995.  These
# guys were co-owners of the Terminal Brain Damage Hall Of Fame along with
# Harris. They have a hazeltine.com domain (but no web page there ) and can
# be reached at:
#
#	Hazeltine
#	450 East Pulaski Road
#	Greenlawn, New York 11740
#
# As late as 1993, manuals for the terminal product line could still be
# purchased from:
#
#	TRW Customer Service Division
#	15 Law Drive
#	P.O. Box 2076
#	Fairfield, NJ 07007-2078
#
# They're now (1998) a subsidiary of General Electric, operating under the
# marque "GEC-Marconi Hazeltine" and doing military avionics.  Web page

# xmitting if you reset it, until you unset and reset the strap!
# Since there is no way to set/unset the strap with an escape

# This hp2626 entry does not use any of the fancy windowing stuff

# 
# Indeed, terminfo does not yet handle such stuff. Since changing 
# any window clears memory, it is probably not possible to use 
# this for screen opt.
# 
# ed is incredibly slow most of the time - I am guessing at the 
# exact padding. Since the terminal uses xoff/xon this is intended 
# only for cost computation, so that the terminal will prefer el 
# or even dl1 which is probably faster!
# 
# \ED\EJ\EC hack for ed from Ed Bradford - apparently ed is only 
# extra slow on the last line of the window. 
# 
# The padding probably should be changed.

# Kimtron ABM 85H added by Dual Systems.
# Some notes about the abm85h entries:
# 1) there are several firmware revs of 85H in the world. Use abm85h-old for
#    firmware revs prior to SP51
# 2) Make sure to use abm85h entry if the terminal is in 85h mode and the
#    abm85e entry if it is in tvi920 emulation mode. They are incompatible
#    in some places and NOT software settable i.e., :is: can't fix it)
# 3) In 85h mode, the arrow keys and special functions transmit when
#    the terminal is in dup-edit, and work only locally in local-edit.
#    Vi won't swallow `del char' for instance, but :ti: turns on
#    dup-edit anyway so that the arrow keys will work right. If the
#    arrow keys don't work the way you like, change :ti:, :te:, and
#    :is:.  Note that 920E mode does not have software commands to toggle
#    between dup and local edit, so you get whatever was set last on the
#    terminal.
# 4) :vb: attribute is nice, but seems too slow to work correctly
#    (\Eb:pc:\Ed)
# 5) Make sure `hidden' attributes are selected. If `embedded' attributes
#    are selected, the <xmc@> entry should be removed.
# 6) auto new-line should be on (selectable from setup mode only)

#### Microdata/MDIS
#
# This was a line of terminals made by McDonnell-Douglas Information Systems.
# These entries come direct from MDIS documentation.  I have edited them only
# to move primary names of the form p[0-9] * to aliases, and to comment out
# :ae:/:as: in a couple of entries without <acsc> strings.  I have 
# also removed the change history; the last version indicates this is
# version 4.3 by A.Barkus, September 1990 (earliest entry is October 1989).
#

# McDonnell Information Systems Terminal Family History
# =========================================
#
# Prism-1, Prism-2 and P99:
#       Ancient Microdata and CMC terminals, vaguely like Adds Regent 25.
#
# Prism-4 and Prism-5:
#       Slightly less ancient range of Microdata terminals. Follow-on from
#       Prism-2, but with many enhancements. P5 has eight display pages.
#
# Prism-6:
#       A special terminal for use with library systems, primarily in Germany.
#       Limited numbers. Similar functionality to P5 (except attributes?).
#
# Prism-7, Prism-8 and Prism-9:
#       More recent range of MDIS terminals, in which P7 and P8
#       replace the P4 & P5, with added functionality, and P9 is the flagship.
#       The P9 has two emulation modes - P8 and ANSI - and includes a
#       large number of the DEC VT220 control sequences. Both
#       P8 and P9 support 80c/24ln/8pg and 132cl/24li/4pg formats.
#
# Prism-12 and Prism-14:
#       Latest range, functionally very similar to the P9.  The P14 has a
#       black-on-white overscanning screen.
#
# The terminfo definitions given here are:
#
# p2      - Prism-2 (or Prism-1 or P99).
#
# p4      - Prism-4 (and older P7s & P8s).
# p5      - Prism-5 (or Prism-6).
#
# p7      - Prism-7.
# p8      - Prism-8 (in national or multinational mode).
# p8-w    - 132 column version of p8.
# p9      - Prism-9 in ANSI mode.
# p9-w    - 132 column version of p9.
# p9-8    - Prism-9 in Prism-8 emulation mode.
# p9-8-w  - As p9-8, but with 132 columns.
#
# p12     - Prism-12 in ANSI mode.
# p12-w   - 132 column version of p12.
# p12-m   - Prism-12 in MDC emulation mode.
# p12-m-w - As p12-m, but with 132 columns.
# p14     - Prism-14 in ANSI mode.
# p14-w   - 132 column version of p14.
# p14-m   - Prism-14 in MDC emulation mode.
# p14-m-w - As p14-m, but with 132 columns.
#
# p2: Prism-2
# -----------
#
# Includes Prism-1 and basic P99 without SP or MP loaded.
# The simplest form of Prism-type terminal.
# Basic cursor movement and clearing operations only.
# No video attributes.
# Notes:
#  Horizontal cursor qualifiers of NUL, XON and XOFF are mapped to the next
#  value up, followed by backspace.

# p9: Prism-9 in ANSI mode
# -------------------------
#
# The "flagship" model of this generation of terminals.
# ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) standard sequences, plus many DEC VT220 ones.
# Notes:
#  Tabs only reset by "reset". Otherwise assumes default (8 cols).
#  Fixes to deal with terminal firmware bugs:
#  . 'ri' uses insert-line since rev index doesn't always
#  . 'sgr0' has extra '0' since esc[m fails
#  . 'fsl' & 'dsl' use illegal char since cr is actioned wrong on line 25
#  Not covered in the current definition:
#  . Labels
#  . Programming Fn keys
#  . Graphic characters (defaults correctly to vt100)
#  . Padding values (sets xon)
# (esr: commented out :as:/:ae: because there's no <acsc>)

# We run our terminals at 2400 baud, so there might be some timing problems at

# scrolls down and insert mode works without redrawing the rest of the line
# to the right of the cursor. This is done with a bit of a kludge using the
# exit graphics mode to get out of insert, but it does not appear to hurt
# anything when using vi at least. If you have some users using act4s with

#### NCR 
#
# NCR's terminal group was merged with AT&T's when AT&T bought the company.
# For what happened to that group, see the ADDS section.
#
# There is an NCR4103 terminal that's just a re-badged Wyse-50.
#

# The following vendor-supplied termcaps were captured from the Boundless
# Technologies site, 8 March 1998.  I removed all-upper-case names that were
# identical, except for case, to lower-case ones.  I also uncommented the acsc
# capabilities.X
#
# The Intecolor emulation of the NCR 2900/260C color terminal is basically a
# DEC vt200/300 with color capabilities added.

# This terminfo file contains color capabilities for the Wyse325 emulation of 
# the NCR 2900/260C color terminal.  Because of the structure of the command
# (escape sequence) used to set color attributes, one of the fore/background
# colors must be preset to a given value. I have set the background color to
# black.  The user can change this setup by altering the last section of the
# 'setf' definition.  The escape sequence to set color attributes is 
#		ESC d y <foreground_color> <background_color> 1  
# In addition, the background color can be changed through the desk accessories.
# The capablitiy 'op' sets colors to green on black (default combination).  
#
# NOTE:  The NCR Unix System Administrator's Shell will not function properly
# 	    if the 'pairs' capability is defined. Un-Comment the 'pairs'
#	    capability and recompile if you wish to have it included.

# This definition for Wyse 350 supports several attributes.  This means
# that it has magic cookies (extra spaces where the attributes begin).
# Some applications do not function well with magic cookies.  The System
# Administrator's Shell in NCR Unix SVR4 1.03 is one such application. 
# If supporting various attributes is not vital, 'xmc#1' and the extra
# attributes can be removed. 
# Mapping to ASCII character set ('acsc' capability) can also be 
# restored if needed.
# In addition, color capabilities have been added to this file.  The drawback,
# however, is that the background color has to be black.  The foreground colors
# are numbered 0 through 15.  
#
# NOTE:  The NCR Unix System Administrator's Shell does not function properly
# 	    with the 'pairs' capability defined as below.  If you wish to
#	    have it included, Un-comment it and recompile (using 'tic').

# NCR7900 DIP switches:
#
# Switch A:
# 1-4 - Baud Rate
# 5   - Parity (Odd/Even)
# 6   - Don't Send or Do Send Spaces
# 7   - Parity Enable
# 8   - Stop Bits (One/Two)
# 
# Switch B:
# 1   - Upper/Lower Shift
# 2   - Typewriter Shift
# 3   - Half Duplex / Full Duplex
# 4   - Light/Dark Background
# 5-6 - Carriage Return Without / With Line Feed
# 7   - Extended Mode
# 8   - Suppress Keyboard Display
# 
# Switch C:
# 1   - End of line entry disabled/enabled
# 2   - Conversational mode / (Local?) Mode
# 3   - Control characters displayed / not displayed
# 4   - (2-wire?) / 4-wire communications
# 5   - RTS on and off for each character
# 6   - (50Hz?) / 60 Hz
# 7   - Exit after level zero diagnostics
# 8   - RS-232 interface
# 
# Switch D:
# 1   - Reverse Channel (yes / no)
# 2   - Manual answer (no / yes)
# 3-4 - Cursor appearance
# 5   - Communication Rate
# 6   - Enable / Disable EXT turnoff
# 7   - Enable / Disable CR turnoff
# 8   - Enable / Disable backspace
#
# Since each attribute parameter is 0 or 1, we shift each attribute (standout,
# reverse, blink, dim, and underline) the appropriate number of bits (by
# multiplying the 0 or 1 by a correct factor to shift) so the bias character,
# '@' is (effectively) "or"ed with each attribute to generate the proper third
# character in the <ESC>0 sequence.  The :sa: string implements the following
# equation:
#
# ((((('@' + P5) | (P4 << 1)) | (P3 << 3)) | (P2 << 4)) | (p1 * 17))    =>
# ((((('@' + P5) + (P4 << 1)) + (P3 << 3)) + (P2 << 4)) + (p1 * 17))
#
#	Where:  P1 <==> Standout attribute parameter
#		P2 <==> Underline attribute parameter
#		P3 <==> Reverse attribute parameter
#		P4 <==> Blink attribute parameter
#		P5 <==> Dim attribute parameter
# From <root@goliath.un.atlantaga.NCR.COM>, init string hacked by SCO.

# Tektronix 4025a
# From: Doug Gwyn <gwyn@brl-smoke.ARPA>
# The following status modes are assumed for normal operation (replace the
# initial "!" by whatever the current command character is):
#	!COM 29			# NOTE: changes command character to GS (^])
#	^]DUP
#	^]ECH R
#	^]EOL
#	^]RSS T
#	^]SNO N
#	^]STO 9 17 25 33 41 49 57 65 73
# Other modes may be set according to communication requirements.
# If the command character is inadvertently changed, termcap can't restore it.
# Insert-character cannot be made to work on both top and bottom rows.
# Clear-to-end-of-display emulation via !DLI 988 is too grotty to use, alas.
# There also seems to be a problem with vertical motion, perhaps involving
# delete/insert-line, following a typed carriage return.  This terminal sucks.
# Delays not specified; use "stty ixon -ixany" to enable DC3/DC1 flow control!
# (tek4025a: removed obsolete ":xx:". This may mean the tek4025a entry won't
# work any more. -- esr)

# The 4110 series may be a wonderful graphics series, but they make the 4025
# look good for screen editing.  In the dialog area, you can't move the cursor

# is no way to scroll.
# 
# Note that there is a floppy for free from Tek that makes the

# an expected enhancement that will use ANSI standard sequences.
# 
# 4112 in non-dialog area pretending to scroll. It really wraps

# Commodore B-128 microcomputer from Doug Tyrol <det@HEL-ACE.ARPA>
# 	I'm trying to write a termcap for a commodore b-128, and I'm
# having a little trouble. I've had to map most of my control characters
# to something that unix will accept (my delete-char is a ctrl-t, etc),
# and create some functions (like cm), but thats life.
# 	The problem is with the arrow keys - right, and up work fine, but
# left deletes the previous character and down I just can't figure out.
# Jove knows what I want, but I don't know what it's sending to me (it
# isn't thats bound to next-line in jove).
# 	Anybody got any ideas? Here's my termcap.
# DAG -- I changed his "^n" entries to "\n"; see if that works.

#### Console types for obsolete UNIX clones
#
# Coherent, Minix, Venix, and several lesser-known kin were OSs for 8088
# machines that tried to emulate the UNIX look'n'feel.  Coherent and Venix
# were commercial, Minix an educational tool sold in conjunction with a book.
# Memory-segmentation limits and a strong tendency to look like V7 long after
# it was obsolete made all three pretty lame.  Venix croaked early.  Coherent
# and Minix were ported to 32-bit Intel boxes, only to be run over by a
# steamroller named `Linux' (which, to be fair, traces some lineage to Minix). 
# Coherent's vendor, the Mark Williams Company, went belly-up in 1994.  There
# are also, I'm told, Minix ports that ran on Amiga and Atari machines and
# even as single processes under SunOS and the Macintosh OS.
#

# This is the entry provided with minix 1.7.4, with bogus :ri: removed.

#### Bell Labs blit terminals
#
# These were AT&T's official entries.  The 5620 FAQ maintained by 
# David Breneman <daveb@dgtl.com> has this to say:
#
#  Actually, in the beginning was the Jerq, and the Jerq was white with a
#  green face, and Locanthi and Pike looked upon the Jerq and said the Jerq
#  was good.  But lo, upon the horizon loomed a mighty management-type person
#  (known now only by the initials VP) who said, the mighty Jerq must stay
#  alone, and could not go forth into the world. So Locanthi and Pike put the
#  Jerq to sleep, cloned its parts, and the Blit was brought forth unto the
#  world. And the Jerq lived the rest of its days in research, but never
#  strayed from those paths.
#
#  In all seriousness, the Blit was originally known as the Jerq, but when
#  it started to be shown outside of the halls of the Bell Labs Research
#  organization, the management powers that be decided that the name could
#  not remain. So it was renamed to be Blit. This was in late 1981.
#
# (The AT&T 5620 was the commercialized Blit.  Its successors were the 630,
# 730, and 730+.)

# The BitGraph was a product of the now-defunct BBN Computer Corporation.
# The parent company, best known as the architects of the Internet, is
# still around.
#
# Jeff DelPapa <dp@world.std.com> writes:
# The bitgraph was a large white box that contained a monochrome bitmap
# display, and a 68000 to run it.  You could download code and run it on
# the cpu, it had 128kb (I think) of memory.  I used one in the late
# 70's, sure beat a vt100.  It had one strange feature tho -- it used
# the cpu to bitblt pixels to scroll, it took longer than the refresh
# rate, and looked like a rubber sheet stretching, then snapping
# upwards.  It had everything the early mac had, except a floppy drive a
# small screen (it had a 17" crisp beauty) and a real OS. They (Bolt
# Beranek and Neuman) sold at most a few hundred of them to the real
# world.  DOD may have bought more...
# 

# Entries for the BitGraph terminals.  The problem 
# with scrolling in vi can only be fixed by getting BBN to put 
# smarter scroll logic in the terminal or changing vi or padding 
# scrolls with about 500 ms delay.
#	
# I always thought the problem was related to the terminal 
# counting newlines in its input buffer before scrolling and 
# then moving the screen that much. Then vi comes along and 
# paints lines in on the bottom line of the screen, so you get 
# this big white gap.

# I have put the long strings in :ti:/:te:. Ti sets up a window

# window back to be the whole screen, and puts the cursor at just

# From: Jan Willem Stumpel <jw.stumpel@inter.nl.net>, 11 May 1997
# The Datapoint 8242 Workstation was sold at least between 1985 
# and 1989. To make the terminal work with this entry, press 
# CONTROL-INT-INT to take the terminal off-line, and type (opt). 
# Set the options AUTO ROLL, ROLL DN, and ESC KBD on, and AUTO 
# CR/LF off. Use control-shift-[] as escape key, control-I as tab, 
# shift-F1 to shift-F5 as F6 to F10 (unshifted F1 to F5 are in
# fact unusable because the strings sent by the terminal conflict
# with other keys).
# The terminal is capable of displaying "box draw" characters.
# For each graphic character you must send 2 ESC's (\E\E) followed 
# by a control character as follows: 
#         character        meaning
#         =========        =======

# The ps300 was the Evans & Sutherland Picture System 300, a high

# Approximate date of release was 1982 (early 80s, anyway), and it had several
# evolutions including (limited) color versions such as the PS330C. PS300s
# were effectively obsolete by the late 80s, replaced by raster graphics
# systems, although specialized applications like molecular modelling

# Tim tells us that:
# I have an old Zenith-19 terminal at home that still gets a lot of use.
# This terminal suffers from the same famous insert-mode padding lossage
# that has been acknowledged for the Z29 terminal.  Emacs is nearly
# unusable on this box, since even a half-scroll up or down the window
# causes flaming terminal death.
#   
# On the Z19, the only way I have found around this problem is to remove
# the :al: and :dl: entries entirely.  No amount of extra padding will
# help (I have tried up to 20000).  Removing :al=\EL$: and :dl=\EM$:
# makes Emacs a little slower, but it remains in the land of the living.
# Big win.

# The major problem with the Z29 is that it requires more padding than the Z19.
#
# The problem with declaring an H19 to be synonymous with a Z29 is that
# it needs more padding. It especially loses if a program attempts
# to put the Z29 into insert mode and insert text at 9600 baud. It
# even loses worse if the program attempts to insert tabs at 9600
# baud. Adding padding to text that is inserted loses because in 
# order to make the Z29 not die, one must add so much padding that
# whenever the program tries to use insert mode, the effective 
# rate is about 110 baud.
# 
# What program would want to put the terminal into insert mode 
# and shove stuff at it at 9600 baud you ask?  
# 
# Emacs. Emacs seems to want to do the mathematically optimal 
# thing in doing a redisplay rather than the practical thing.
# When it is about to output a line on top of a line that is 
# already on the screen, instead of just killing to the end of 
# the line and outputting the new line, it compares the old line 
# and the new line and if there are any similarities, it 
# constructs the new line by deleting the text on the old line 
# on the terminal that is already there and then inserting new
# text into the line to transform it into the new line that is 
# to be displayed. The Z29 does not react kindly to this.
# 
# But don't cry for too long.... There is a solution. You can make
# a termcap entry for the Z29 that says the Z29 has no insert mode.
# Then Emacs cannot use it. "Oh, no, but now inserting into a 
# line will be really slow", you say. Well there is a sort of a
# solution to that too. There is an insert character option on 
# the Z29 that will insert one character. Unfortunately, it 
# involves putting the terminal into ansi mode, inserting the 
# character, and changing it back to H19 mode. All this takes 12 
# characters. Pretty expensive to insert one character, but it 
# works. Either Emacs doesn't try to use its inserting hack when 
# it's only given an insert character ability or the Z29 doesn't 
# require padding with this (the former is probably more likely, 
# but I haven't checked it out).
# (z29: added empty <acsc> to suppress a tic warning, merged in

# If we set TERM=vt100, and set the Modgraph screen to 24 lines, setting a

# like normal mode of operation to be using a Modgraph with 48 line setting.
# If we set TERM=mod (which is a valid entry in termcap with 48 lines)
# the setting mark and delete-to-killbuffer results in the deletion of only
# the line the mark is set on.
# We've discovered that the delete-to-killbuffer works correctly
# with TERM=mod and screen set to 80x48 but it's not obvious.  Only

# Bob Manson <manson@pattyr.acs.ohio-state.edu> writes (28 Apr 1995):
#
# Synertek used to make ICs, various 6502-based single-board process
# control and hobbyist computers, and assorted peripherals including a
# series of small inexpensive terminals (I think they were one of the
# first to have a "terminal-on-a-keyboard", where the terminal itself
# was only slightly larger than the keyboard).
#
# They apparently had a KTM-1 model, which I've never seen. The KTM-2/40
# was a 40x24 terminal that could connect to a standard TV through a
# video modulator.  The KTM-2/80 was the 80-column version (the 2/40
# could be upgraded to the 2/80 by adding 2 2114 SRAMs and a new ROM).
# I have a KTM-2/80 still in working order.  The KTM-2s had fully
# socketed parts, used 2 6507s, a 6532 as keyboard scanner, a program
# ROM and 2 ROMs as character generators. They were incredibly simple,
# and I've never had any problems with mine (witness the fact that mine
# was made in 1981 and is still working great... I've blown the video
# output transistor a couple of times, but it's a 2N2222 :-)
#
# The KTM-3 (which is what is listed in the terminfo file) was their
# attempt at putting a KTM-2 in a box (and some models came with a
# CRT). It wasn't much different from the KTM-2 hardware-wise, but the
# control and escape sequences are very different. The KTM-3 was always
# real broken, at least according to the folks I've talked to about it.
# 
# The padding in the entry is probably off--these terminals were very
# slow (it takes like 100ms for the KTM-2 to clear the screen...) And
# anyone with any sanity replaced the ROMs with something that provided
# a reasonable subset of VT100 functionality, since the usual ROMs were
# obviously very primitive... oh, you could get an upgraded ROM from
# Synertek for some incredible amount of money, but what hacker with an
# EPROM burner would do that? :)
# 
# Sorry I don't have any contact info; I believe they were located in
# Sunnyvale, and I'm fairly sure they are still manufacturing ICs
# (they've gone to ASICs and FPGAs), but I doubt they're in the computer
# business these days.
#

# Tested, seems to work fine with vi.

# The Teleray terminals were all discontinued in 1992-93.  RI still services
# and repairs these beasts, but no longer manufactures them.  The Teleray
# people believe that all the types listed below are very rare now (1995).
# There was a newer line of Telerays (Model 7, Model 20, Model 30, and
# Model 100) that were ANSI-compatible.
#
# Note two things called "teleray".  Reorder should move the common one
# to the front if you have either.  A dumb teleray with the cursor stuck
# on the bottom and no obvious model number is probably a 3700.

# "Teleray Arpa Special", officially designated as

# This is the new (1981) fast microcode updating the older "arpa" proms

# converts the keypad to programmable function keys, and has other goodies.
# Standout mode is still broken (magic cookie, etc) so is suppressed as no

######## OTHER OBSOLETE TYPES
#
# These terminals are *long* dead -- these entries are retained for
# historical interest only.
#

#### Obsolete non-ANSI software emulations
#

#### Avatar
#
# These entries attempt to describe Avatar, a terminal emulation used with
# MS-DOS bulletin-board systems.  It was designed to give ANSI-like
# capabilities, but with cheaper (shorter) control sequences.  Messy design,
# excessively dependent on PC idiosyncracies, but apparently rather popular
# in the BBS world.
#
# No color support.  Avatar doesn't fit either of the Tektronix or HP color
# models that terminfo knows about.  An Avatar color attribute is the
# low 7 bits of the IBM-PC display-memory attribute.  Bletch.
#
# I wrote these entries while looking at the Avatar spec.  I don't have
# the facilities to test them.  Let me know if they work, or don't.
#
# Avatar escapes not used by these entries (because maybe you're smarter
# and more motivated than I am and can figure out how to wrap terminfo
# around some of them, and because they are weird enough to be funny):
#				level 0:
# ^L		-- clear window/reset current attribute to default
# ^V^A%p1%c	-- set current color attribute, parameter decodes as follows:
# 
#      bit:         6   5   4   3   2   1   0
#                   |       |   |   |       |
#                   +---+---+   |   +---+---+
#                       |       |       |
#                       |       |  foreground color
#                       |  foreground intensity
#                  background color
#				level 0+:
# ^V^J%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c	-- scroll (p2,p3) to (p4,p5) up by p1 lines
# ^V^K%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c	-- scroll (p2,p3) to (p4,p5) down by p1 lines
# ^V^L%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c		-- clear p2 lines and p3 cols w/attr %p1 
# ^V^M%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c	-- fill p3 lines & p4 cols w/char p2+attr %p1 
# (^V^L and ^V^M set the current attribute as a side-effect.)
# ^V ^Y <a> [...] <c>	-- repeat pattern. <a> specifies the number of bytes
#			   in the pattern, <c> the number of times the pattern
#		  	   should be repeated. If either value is 0, no-op.
#			   The pattern can contain Avatar console codes,
#			   including other ^V ^Y patterns.
#				level 1:
# ^V^O		-- clockwise mode on; turn print direction right each time you
#		   hit a window edge (yes, really).  Turned off by CR
# ^V^P		-- no-op
# ^V^Q%c	-- query the driver
# ^V^R		-- driver reset
# ^V^S		-- Sound tone (PC-specific)
# ^V^T			-- change highlight at current cursor poition to %c
# ^V^U%p1%c%p2%c	-- highlight window <a> with attribute <b>
# ^V^V%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c
#			-- define window

# CTRM terminal emulator
# 1. underlining is not allowed with colors: first, is is simulated by 
# black on white, second, it disables background color manipulations.
# 2. BLINKING, REVERSE and BOLD are allowed with colors,
# so we have to save their status in the static registers A, B and H
# respectively, to be able to restore them when color changes
# (because any color change turns off ALL attributes)
# 3. :md: and :mr: sequences alternate modes,
# rather then simply  entering them.  Thus we have to check the
# static register B and H to determine the status, before sending the 
# escape sequence.
# 4. :me: now must set the status of all 3 register (A,B,H) to zero
# and then reset colors
# 5. implementation of the protect mode would badly penalize the performance.
# we would have to use \E&bn sequence to turn off colors (as well as all
# other attributes), and keep the status of protect mode in yet another
# static variable.  If someone really needs this mode, they would have to
# create another terminfo entry.
# 6. original color-pair is white on black.
# store the information about colors into static registers
# 7. set foreground color.  it performs the following steps.
#   1) turn off all attributes
#   2) turn on the background and video attributes that have been turned
#      on before (this information is stored in static registers X,Y,Z,A,B,H,D).
#   3) turn on foreground attributes
#   4) store information about foreground into U,V,W static registers
# 8. turn on background: similar to turn on foreground above

# keyboard.  All the keys are crammed together, much like some laptop
# PCs today, but perhaps less well organized...all these units have a

# Kenneth Randell <kenr@datametrics.com> writes on 31 Dec 1998:
# I had a couple of scopes (3221) like this once where I used to work, around
# the 1987 time frame if memory serves me correctly.  These scopes were made  
# by an outfit called LANPAR Technologies, and were meant to me DEC VT 220
# compatible.  The 3220 was a plain text terminal like the VT-220, the 3221
# was a like the VT-240 (monochrome with Regis + Sixel graphics), and the 3222
# was like the VT-241 (color with Regis + Sixel Graphics).  These terminals
# (3221) cost about $1500 each, and one was always broken -- had to be sent
# back to the shop for repairs.
# The only real advantage these scopes had over the VT-240's were:
# 1) They were faster in the Regis display, or at least the ones I did
# 2) They had a handy debugging feature where you could split-screen the
# scope, the graphics would appear on the top, and the REGIS commands would
# appear on the bottom.  I don't remember the VT-240s being able to do that.
# I would swear that LANPAR Technologies was in MA someplace, but since I
# don't work at the same place anymore, and those terminals and manuals were
# long since junked, I cannot be any more sure than that.

######## ICH/ICH1 VERSUS RMIR/SMIR
#
# Some non-curses applications get confused if both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# are present; the symptom is doubled characters in an update using insert.
# These applications are technically correct; in both 4.3BSD termcap and
# terminfo, you're not actually supposed to specify both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# unless the terminal needs both.  To my knowledge, no terminal still in this
# file requires both other than the very obsolete dm2500.
#
# For ncurses-based applications this is not a problem, as ncurses uses
# one or the other as appropriate but never mixes the two.  Therefore we
# have not corrected entries like `linux' and `xterm' that specify both.
# If you see doubled characters from these, use the linux-nic and xterm-nic
# entries that suppress ich/ich1.  And upgrade to ncurses!
#

######## VT100/ANSI/ISO 6429/ECMA-48/PC-TERM TERMINAL STANDARDS
#
# ANSI X3.64 has been withdrawn and replaced by ECMA-48.  The ISO 6429 and
# ECMA-48 standards are said to be almost identical, but are not the same
# as X3.64 (though for practical purposes they are close supersets of it).
#
# You can obtain ECMA-48 for free by sending email to helpdesk@ecma.ch
# requesting the standard(s) you want (i.e. ECMA-48, "Control Functions for
# Coded Character Sets"), include your snail-mail address, and you should
# receive the document in due course.  Don't expect an email acknowledgement.
#
# Related standards include "X3.4-1977: American National Standard Code for
# Information Interchange" (the ASCII standard) and "X3.41.1974: 
# Code-Extension Techniques for Use with the 7-Bit Coded Character Set of
# American National Standard for Information Interchange."  I believe (but
# am not certain) that these are effectively identical to ECMA-6 and ECMA-35
# respectively.

# and ECMA-48 Control Functions for Coded Character Sets.

# Much of the content of this comment is adapted from a table prepared by
# Richard Shuford, based on a 1984 Byte article.  Terminfo correspondences,

# have been added.  Control functions described in ECMA-48 only are tagged

# The table is a complete list of the defined ANSI X3.64/ECMA-48 control
# sequences.  In the main table, \E stands for an escape (\033) character,
# SPC for space.  Pn stands for a single numeric parameter to be inserted
# in decimal ASCII.  Ps stands for a list of such parameters separated by
# semicolons.  Parameter meanings for most parametrized sequences are
# decribed in the notes.

# Notes:
#
# Some control characters are listed in the ECMA-48 standard without 
# being assigned functions relevant to terminal control there (they 
# referred to other standards such as ISO 1745 or ECMA-35).  They are listed
# here anyway for completeness.
#
# (A) ECMA-48 calls this "CancelCharacter" but retains the CCH abbreviation.
#
# (B) There seems to be some confusion abroad between CHA and HPA.  Most
# `ANSI' terminals accept the CHA sequence, not the HPA. but terminfo calls
# the capability (hpa).  ECMA-48 calls this "Cursor Character Absolute" but
# preserved the CHA abbreviation.
#
# (C) CHT corresponds to terminfo (tab).  Usually it has the value ^I.
# Occasionally (as on, for example, certain HP terminals) this has the HTJ
# value.  ECMA-48 calls this "Cursor Forward Tabulation" but preserved the
# CHT abbreviation.
#
# (D) terminfo (nel) is usually \r\n rather than ANSI \EE.
#
# (E) ECMA-48 calls this "Active Position Report" but preserves the CPR 
# abbreviation.
# 
# (F) CTC parameter values: 0 = set char tab, 1 = set line tab, 2 = clear
# char tab, 3 = clear line tab, 4 = clear all char tabs on current line, 
# 5 = clear all char tabs, 6 = clear all line tabs.
#
# (G) CUP and HVP are identical in effect.  Some ANSI.SYS versions accept
# HVP, but always allow CUP as an alternate.  ECMA-48 calls HVP "Character
# Position Absolute" but retains the HVP abbreviation.
#
# (H) ECMA calls this "Cursor Line Tabulation" but preserves the CVT

# 
# Delim  a Delimiter
# 
# x/y    identifies a character by position in the ASCII table (column/row)
# 
# eF     editor function (see explanation)
# 
# FE     format effector (see explanation)
#
# F      is a Final character in

# 
# Ce     is a control represented as a single bit combination in the C1 set
#        of controls in an 8-bit character set
# 
# C0     the familiar set of 7-bit ASCII control characters
# 
# C1     roughly, the set of control chars available only in 8-bit systems.
#        This is too complicated to explain fully here, so read Jim Fleming's
#        article in the February 1983 BYTE, especially pages 214 through 224.
# 
# Fe     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that has an
#        equivalent representation in an 8-bit environment as a Ce-type
#        (Fe ranges from 4/0 to 5/15)
# 
# Fs     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that is
#        standardized internationally with identical representation in 7-bit
#        and 8-bit environments and is independent of the currently
#        designated C0 and C1 control sets (Fs ranges from 6/0 to 7/14)
# 
# I      is an Intermediate character from 2/0 to 2/15 (inclusive) in the
#        ASCII table
# 
# P      is a parameter character from 3/0 to 3/15 (inclusive) in the ASCII

# 
# Ps     is a variable number of selective parameters in a control sequence
#        with each selective parameter separated from the other by the code
#        3/11 (which usually represents a semicolon); Ps ranges from
#        3/0 to 3/9 and includes 3/11
#
# *      Not relevant to terminal control, listed for completeness only.
# 
# Format Effectors versus Editor Functions
# 
# A format effector specifies how following output is to be displayed.
# An editor function allows you to modify the display.  Informally
# format effectors may be destructive; format effectors should not be.
# 
# For instance, a format effector that moves the "active position" (the 
# cursor or equivalent) one space to the left would be useful when you want to
# create an overstrike, a compound character made of two standard characters
# overlaid. Control-H, the Backspace character, is actually supposed to be a
# format effector, so you can do this. But many systems use it in a
# nonstandard fashion, as an editor function, deleting the character to the
# left of the cursor and moving the cursor left. When Control-H is assumed to
# be an editor function, you cannot predict whether its use will create an
# overstrike unless you also know whether the output device is in an "insert
# mode" or an "overwrite mode". When Control-H is used as a format effector,
# its effect can always be predicted. The familiar characters carriage
# return, linefeed, formfeed, etc., are defined as format effectors.
#
# NOTES ON THE DEC VT100 IMPLEMENTATION
# 
# Control sequences implemented in the VT100 are as follows:
# 
#      CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, DA, DSR, ED, EL, HTS, HVP, IND,
#      LNM, NEL, RI, RIS, RM, SGR, SM, TBC
# 
# plus several private DEC commands.
# 
# Erasing parts of the display (EL and ED) in the VT100 is performed thus:
# 
#      Erase from cursor to end of line           Esc [ 0 K    or Esc [ K
#      Erase from beginning of line to cursor     Esc [ 1 K
#      Erase line containing cursor               Esc [ 2 K
#      Erase from cursor to end of screen         Esc [ 0 J    or Esc [ J
#      Erase from beginning of screen to cursor   Esc [ 1 J
#      Erase entire screen                        Esc [ 2 J
#
# Some brain-damaged terminal/emulators respond to Esc [ J as if it were
# Esc [ 2 J, but this is wrong; the default is 0.
# 
# The VT100 responds to receiving the DA (Device Attributes) control
# 
#      Esc [ c    (or Esc [ 0 c)
# 
# by transmitting the sequence
# 
#      Esc [ ? l ; Ps c
# 
# where Ps is a character that describes installed options.
# 
# The VT100's cursor location can be read with the DSR (Device Status
# Report) control
# 
#      Esc [ 6 n
# 
# The VT100 reports by transmitting the CPR sequence
# 
#      Esc [ Pl ; Pc R
# 
# where Pl is the line number and Pc is the column number (in decimal).
# 
# The specification for the DEC VT100 is document EK-VT100-UG-003.

#### ANSI.SYS
# 
# Here is a description of the color and attribute controls supported in the
# the ANSI.SYS driver under MS-DOS.  Most console drivers and ANSI
# terminal emulators for Intel boxes obey these.  They are a proper subset
# of the ECMA-48 escapes.
#
# 0	all attributes off
# 1	foreground bright
# 4	underscore on
# 5	blink on/background bright (not reliable with brown)
# 7	reverse-video
# 8	set blank (non-display)
# 10	set primary font
# 11	set first alternate font (on PCs, display ROM characters 1-31)
# 12	set second alternate font (on PCs, display IBM high-half chars)
#
#			Color attribute sets
# 3n	set foreground color       / 0=black, 1=red,     2=green, 3=brown,
# 4n	set background color       \ 4=blue,  5=magenta, 6=cyan,  7=white
# Bright black becomes gray.  Bright brown becomes yellow,
# These coincide with the prescriptions of the ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.
#
# * If the 5 attribute is on and you set a background color (40-47) it is
#   supposed to enable bright background.
#
# * Many VGA cards (such as the Paradise and compatibles) do the wrong thing
#   when you try to set a "bright brown" (yellow) background with attribute
#   5 (you get a blinking yellow foreground instead).  A few displays
#   (including the System V console) support an attribute 6 that undoes this
#   braindamage (this is required by iBCS2).
#
# * Some older versions of ANSI.SYS have a bug that causes thems to require
#   ESC [ Pn k as EL rather than the ANSI ESC [ Pn K.  (This is not ECMA-48
#   compatible.)

#### Intel Binary Compatibility Standard
#
# For comparison, here are the capabilities implied by the Intel Binary 
# Compatibility Standard for UNIX systems (Intel order number 468366-001).
# These recommendations are optional.  IBCS2 allows the leading escape to
# be either the 7-bit \E[ or 8-bit \0233 introducer, in accordance with
# the ANSI X.364/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.  Here are the iBCS2 capabilities
# (as described in figure 9-3 of the standard).  Those expressed in the ibcs2
# terminfo entry are followed with the corresponding capability in parens:
#
#	CSI <n>k		disable (n=0) or enable (n=1) keyclick
#	CSI 2h   		lock keyboard
#	CSI 2i  		send screen as input
#	CSI 2l  		unlock keyboard
#	CSI 6m  		enable background color intensity
#	CSI <0-2>c		reserved
#	CSI <0-59>m		select graphic rendition
#	CSI <n>;<m>H	(cup)	cursor to line n and column m
#	CSI <n>;<m>f		cursor to line n and column m
#	CSI <n>@	(ich)	insert characters
#	CSI <n>A	(cuu)	cursor up n lines
#	CSI <n>B	(cud)	cursor down n lines
#	CSI <n>C	(cuu)	cursor right n characters
#	CSI <n>D	(cud)	cursor left n characters
#	CSI <n>E		cursor down n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>F		cursor up n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>G	(hpa)	position cursor at column n-1
#	CSI <n>J	(ed)	erase in display
#	CSI <n>K	(el)	erase in line
#	CSI <n>L	(il)	insert line(s)
#	CSI <n>P	(dch)	delete characters
#	CSI <n>S	(indn)	scroll up n lines
#	CSI <n>T	(rin)	scroll down n lines
#	CSI <n>X	(ech)	erase characters
#	CSI <n>Z	(cbt)	back up n tab stops
#	CSI <n>`		cursor to column n on line
#	CSI <n>a	(cuu)	cursor right n characters
#	CSI <n>d	(vpa)	cursor to line n
#	CSI <n>e		cursor down n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>g	(cbt)	clear all tabs
#	CSI <n>z		make virtual terminal n active
#	CSI ?7h 	(smam)	turn automargin on
#	CSI ?7l 	(rmam)	turn automargin off
#	CSI s     		save cursor position
#	CSI u   		restore cursor position to saved value
#	CSI =<c>A		set overscan color
#	CSI =<c>F		set normal foreground color
#	CSI =<c>G		set normal background color
#	CSI =<c>H		set reverse foreground color
#	CSI =<c>I		set reverse foreground color
#	CSI =<c>J		set graphic foreground color
#	CSI =<c>K		set graphic foreground color
#	CSI =<n>g	(dispc) display n from alternate graphics character set
#	CSI =<p>;<d>B		set bell parameters
#	CSI =<s>;<e>C		set cursor parameters
#	CSI =<x>D		enable/disable intensity of background color
#	CSI =<x>E		set/clear blink vs. bold background
#	CSI 7     	(sc)	(sc) save cursor position
#	CSI 8   	(rc)	(rc) restore cursor position to saved value
#	CSI H		(hts)	(hts) set tab stop
#	CSI Q<n><string>	define function key string
#				(string must begin and end with delimiter char)
#	CSI c   	(clear) clear screen
#
# The lack of any specification for attributes in SGR (among other things)
# makes this a wretchedly weak standard. The table above is literally 
# everything iBSC2 has to say about terminal escape sequences; there is
# no further discussion of their meaning or how to set the parameters
# in these sequences at all.
#

######## NONSTANDARD CAPABILITY TRANSLATIONS USED IN THIS FILE
#
# The historical termcap file entries were written primarily in 4.4BSD termcap.
# The 4.4BSD termcap set was substantially larger than the original 4.1BSD set,
# with the extension names chosen for compatibility with the termcap names
# assigned in System V terminfo.  There are some variant extension sets out
# there.  We try to describe them here.
#
# XENIX extensions:
#
# The XENIX extensions include a set of function-key capabilities as follows:
#
#       code	XENIX variable name	terminfo name	name clashes?
#	----	-------------------	-------------	-----------------------
#	CL	key_char_left
#	CR	key_char_right
#	CW	key_change_window			create_window
#	EN	key_end          	kend
#	HM	key_home		khome
#	HP	??
#	LD	key_delete_line  	kdl1
#	LF	key_linefeed     			label_off
#	NU	key_next_unlocked_cell
#	PD	key_page_down   	knp
#	PL	??
#	PN	start_print		mc5
#	PR	??
#	PS	stop_print		mc4
#	PU	key_page_up     	kpp		pulse
#	RC	key_recalc				remove_clock
#	RF	key_toggle_ref				req_for_input
#	RT	key_return      	kent
#	UP	key_up_arrow           	kcuu1   	parm_up_cursor
#	WL	key_word_left
#	WR	key_word_right
#
# The XENIX extensions also include the following character-set and highlight
# capabilities:
#
#	XENIX	terminfo	function
#	-----	--------	------------------------------
#	GS	smacs		start alternate character set
#	GE	rmacs		end alternate character set
#	GG			:as:/:ae: glitch (analogous to :sg:/:ug:)
#	bo	blink		begin blink (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	be			end blink (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	bb			blink glitch  (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	it	dim		begin dim (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	ie			end dim (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	ig			dim glitch  (not used in /etc/termcap)
#
# Finally, XENIX also used the following forms-drawing capabilities:
#
#	single	double  type             ASCII approximation 
#	------	------	-------------    -------------------
#	GV	Gv	vertical line             |
#	GH	Gv	horizontal line       -   _
#	G1	G5	top right corner       _   |
#	G2	G6	top left corner       | 
#	G3	G7	bottom left corner         |_
#	G4	G8	bottom right corner   _|
#	GD	Gd	down-tick character        T
#	GL	Gl	left-tick character   -|
#	GR	Gr	right-tick character       |-
#	GC	Gc	middle intersection   -|-
#	GU	Gu	up-tick character          _|_
#
# These were invented to take advantage of the IBM PC ROM character set.  One
# can compose an acsc string from the single-width characters as follows
#	"j{G4}k{G1}l{G2}m{G3}q{GH}x{GV}t{GR}u{GL}v{GU}w{GD}n{GC}"
# When translating a termcap file, ncurses tic will do this automatically.
# The double forms characters don't fit the SVr4 terminfo model.
#
# AT&T Extensions:
#
# The old AT&T 5410, 5420, 5425, pc6300plus, 610, and s4 entries used a set of
# nonstandard capabilities.  Its signature is the KM capability, used to name
# some sort of keymap file.  EE, BO, CI, CV, XS, DS, FL and FE are in this
# set.  Comments in the original, and a little cross-checking with other AT&T
# documentation, seem to establish that BO=:mr: (start reverse video), DS=:mh:
# (start dim), XS=:mk: (secure/invisible mode), EE=:me: (end highlights),
# FL=:LO: (enable soft labels), FE=:LF: (disable soft labels), CI=:vi: (make
# cursor invisible), and CV=:ve: (make cursor normal).
#
# HP Extensions
#
# The HP library (as of mid-1995, their term.h file version 70.1) appears to
# have the System V capabilities up to SVr1 level.  After that, it supports
# two nonstandard caps meml and memu corresponding to the old termcap :ml:,
# :mu: capabilities.  After that, it supports caps plab_norm, label_on,
# label_off, and key_f11..key_f63 capabilities like SVr4's.  This makes the
# HP binary format incompatible with SVr4's.
#
# IBM Extensions
#
# There is a set of nonstandard terminfos used by IBM's AIX operating system.
# The AIX terminfo library diverged from SVr1 terminfo, and replaces all
# capabilities following prtr_non with the following special capabilties:
# box[12], batt[12], colb[0123456789], colf[0123456789], f[01234567], kbtab,
# kdo, kcmd, kcpn, kend, khlp, knl, knpn, kppn, kppn, kquit, ksel, kscl, kscr,
# ktab, kmpf[123456789], apstr, ksf1..ksf10, kf11...kf63, kact, topl, btml,
# rvert, lvert.   Some of these are identical to XPG4/SVr4 equivalents:
# kcmd, kend, khlp, and kf11...kf63.  Two others (kbtab and ksel) can be
# renamed (to kcbt and kslt).  The places in the box[12] capabilities
# correspond to acsc chars, here is the mapping:
#
#	box1[0]  = ACS_ULCORNER
#	box1[1]  = ACS_HLINE	
#	box1[2]  = ACS_URCORNER
#	box1[3]  = ACS_VLINE
#	box1[4]  = ACS_LRCORNER
#	box1[5]  = ACS_LLCORNER
#	box1[6]  = ACS_TTEE
#	box1[7]  = ACS_RTEE
#	box1[8]  = ACS_BTEE
#	box1[9]  = ACS_LTEE
#	box1[10] = ACS_PLUS
#
# The box2 characters are the double-line versions of these forms graphics.
# The AIX binary terminfo format is incompatible with SVr4's.
#
# Iris console extensions:
#
# HS is half-intensity start; HE is half-intensity end
# CT is color terminal type (for Curses & rogue)
# CP is color change escape sequence
# CZ are color names (for Curses & rogue)
#
# The ncurses tic utility recognizes HS as an alias for mh <dim>.
#
# TC Extensions:
#
# There is a set of extended termcaps associated with something
# called the "Terminal Control" or TC package created by MainStream Systems,
# Winfield Kansas.  This one also uses GS/GE for as/ae, and also uses
# CF for civis and CO for cvvis.  Finally, they define a boolean :ct:
# that flags color terminals.
#
######## CHANGE HISTORY
#
# The last /etc/termcap version maintained by John Kunze was 8.3, dated 8/5/94.
# Releases 9 and up are maintained by Eric S. Raymond as part of the ncurses
# project.
#
# This file contains all the capability information present in John Kunze's
# last version of the termcap master file, except as noted in the change 
# comments at end of file.  Some information about very ancient obsolete
# capabilities has been moved to comments.  Some all-numeric names of older
# terminals have been retired.
#
# I changed :MT: to :km: (the 4.4BSD name) everywhere.  I commented out some
# capabilities (EP, dF, dT, dV, kn, ma, ml, mu, xr, xx) that are no longer
# used by BSD curses.
#
# The 9.1.0 version of this file was translated from my lightly-edited copy of
# 8.3, then mechanically checked against 8.3 using Emacs Lisp code written for
# the purpose.  Unless the ncurses tic implementation and the Lisp code were
# making perfectly synchronized mistakes which I then failed to catch by
# eyeball, the translation was correct and perfectly information-preserving.
#
# Major version number bumps correspond to major version changes in ncurses.
#
# Here is a log of the changes since then:
#
# 9.1.0 (Wed Feb  1 04:50:32 EST 1995):
#	* First terminfo master translated from 8.3.

#	* Added contact & status info from G. Clark Brown <clark@sssi.com>.
# 9.3.1 (Tue Feb  7 12:00:24 EST 1995):
#	* Better XENIX keycap translation.  Describe TC termcaps.
#	* Contact and history info supplied by Qume.
# 9.3.2 (Sat Feb 11 23:40:02 EST 1995):
#	* Raided the Shuford FTP site for recent termcaps/terminfos.
#	* Added information on X3.64 and VT100 standard escape sequences.
# 9.3.3 (Mon Feb 13 12:26:15 EST 1995):

#
# 9.4.0 (Sat Feb 25 16:43:25 EST 1995):
