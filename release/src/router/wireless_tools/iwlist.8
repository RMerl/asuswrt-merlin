.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Iwlist
is used to display some additional information from a wireless network
interface that is not displayed by
.IR iwconfig (8).
The main argument is used
to select a category of information,
.B iwlist
displays in detailed form all information related to this category,
including information already shown by
.IR iwconfig (8).

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.BR scan [ning]
Give the list of Access Points and Ad-Hoc cells in range, and
optionally a whole bunch of information about them (ESSID, Quality,
Frequency, Mode...). The type of information returned depends on what
the card supports.
.br
Triggering scanning is a privileged operation
.RI ( root
only) and normal users can only read left-over scan results. By
default, the way scanning is done (the scope of the scan) is dependant
on the card and card settings.
.br
This command take optional arguments, however most drivers will ignore
those. The option
.B essid
is used to specify a scan on a specific ESSID. The option
.B last
do not trigger a scan and read left-over scan results.
.TP
.BR freq [uency]/ channel
Give the list of available frequencies in the device and the number of
defined channels. Please note that usually the driver returns the
total number of channels and only the frequencies available in the
present locale, so there is no one-to-one mapping between frequencies
displayed and channel numbers.
.TP
.BR rate / bit [rate]
List the bit-rates supported by the device.
.TP
.BR keys / enc [ryption]
List the encryption key sizes supported and list all the encryption
keys set in the device.
.TP
.B power
List the various Power Management attributes and modes of the device.
.TP
.B txpower
List the various Transmit Powers available on the device.
.TP
.B retry
List the transmit retry limits and retry lifetime on the device.
.TP
.BR ap / accesspoint / peers
Give the list of Access Points in range, and optionally the quality of
link to them. This feature is
.B obsolete
and now deprecated in favor of scanning support (above), and most
drivers don't support it.
.br
Some drivers may use this command to return a specific list of Peers
or Access Points, such as the list of Peers associated/registered with
the card. See your driver documentation for details.
.TP
.B event
List the wireless events supported by the device.
.TP
.B auth
List the WPA authentication parametes curently set.
.TP
.BR wpa [keys]
List all the WPA encryption keys set in the device.
.TP
.B genie
List the Generic Information Elements set in the device (used for WPA
support).
.TP
.BR modu [lation]
List the modulations supported by the device and the modulations
currently enabled.
.TP
.B --version
Display the version of the tools, as well as the recommended and
current Wireless Extensions version for the tool and the various
wireless interfaces.
.TP
.B --help
Display short help message.
