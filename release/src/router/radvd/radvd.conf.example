# This setting causes radvd to replace the first 48 bits of the prefix
# with the 6to4 address generated from the specified interface.  For example,
# if the address of ppp0 is 192.0.2.25 when radvd configures itself, this
# prefix will be advertised as 2002:C000:0219:1234::/64.
#
# If ppp0 is not available at configuration time, this prefix will not be
# advertised, but other prefixes listed in the configuration will be
# advertised as usual.
#
# When using the Base6to4Interface option, make sure radvd receives a
# SIGHUP every time the ppp0 interface goes up, down, or is assigned a
# new IPv4 address.  The SIGHUP will cause radvd to recognize that the
# ppp0 interface has changed and will adjust the advertisements
# accordingly.
