	*NONE* of the items are being actively worked on.
        So, if you're interested in one of these features,
        it means you'll have to submit a patch... :-)


read list of interfaces with SIOCGIFCONF (AF_INET6 support in the kernel would
be nice) or from /proc

[ Peter wants that a debugging level greater than 0 doesn't stop radvd
from forking.]

support for few protocol constants defined in RFC 4861 Sec 10 is missing.

consider whether UnicastOnly flag should be detected by radvdump.

read the man pages one more time and make sure their are understandable
and English is correct

The following parts of RFC4861 are not implemented:
 - section 6.2.5: when AdvSendAdvertisements changes to FALSE, we don't send 
   a final RA with zero Router Lifetime (we just send it when shutting down).
   (SHOULD)
 - section 6.2.8: if the link-local address of the router changes, it should
   multicast a few RAs from the old address with zero router lifetime, and a
   few from the new address. (SHOULD).

Consider whether to support RFC 4286 (Multicast Router Discovery).

Consider whether to support multiple IPv4 addresses with Base6to4Interface
(currently the code just picks one).

Consider whether to support multiple prefixes and routes with a single
configuration line (instead of having to specify each prefix/route
separately) somewhat similar to how RDNSS configuration already supports.

Consider whether to support a generalization of Base6to4Interface for
arbitrary IPv6 prefixes, to be used for automatic generation of downstream
prefixes.  Also consider whether this would need to support multiple IPv6
prefixes on the upstream interfaces.  See question 3 in README for more on
this.

Use getifaddrs() instead of ioctl SIOCGIFADDR and other friends.  The
problem with this is that e.g. RHL73's glibc didn't support getifaddrs(),
and before glibc 2.3.3 getifaddrs() didn't use netlink so it didn't work
well with IPv6.  These old compat concerns are likely moot now..

Consider whether radvd should work around missing/broken interfaces by
default, especially if a previously working interface gets disabled.

Implement Secure Neighbor Discovery (RFC 3971).

Interface reconfiguration is only supported on Linux.  Consider whether to
support that (and privilege separation as a result) on BSD as well.

The restrictions of the (privilege separation) master process could
be restricted as currently it basically only needs to write to /proc,
do some logging and nothing else.

radvd does not support splitting up RAs to multiple packets (RFC4861 6.2.3
last paragraph). In practise this limits advertising to ~45 prefixes on a 
link, but there is no reason to be able to so.  In order to avoid
fragmenting packets yet support receiving full-size frames, our hack is to
have a bigger receive than send buffer. We could try using setsockopt
IPV6_DONTFRAG, but at least Linux glibc doesn't appear to support it yet.

Known problems (probably can't do anything about these):
 - If interface MAC address changes, radvd will keep sending the old MAC
   in its LL option (until HUP signal).  The kernel will keep sending
   Ethernet frames with the old MAC until interface is flapped.

localtime() used in vlog() is not reentrant, and is not safe in signal
handling context.  There may be other such functions as well. It's not clear
what could be done about that.
