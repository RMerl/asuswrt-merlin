--enable-tcp-zebra # TCP/IP socket is used for protocol daemon and zebra.
--enable-oldrib    # Turn on old RIB implementation.

Old RIB implementation will be removed in zebra-0.91.

** From this beta release --enable-multipath is supported.  This
option is only effective on GNU/Linux kernel with
CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER and CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH is set.

--enable-multipath=ARG  # ARG must be digit.  When ARG is 0 unlimit multipath number.

** Metric value is reflected to kernel routing table.

** "show ip route" display uptime of RIP,OSPF,BGP routes.

** New RIB implementation is added.

Now we have enhanced RIB (routing information base) implementation in
zebra.  New RIB has many new features and fixed some bugs which exist
in old RIB code.

*** Static route with distance value

    Static route can be specified with administrative distance.  The
  distance value 255 means it is not installed into the kernel.
  Default value of distance for static route is 1.
  
    ip route A.B.C.D/M A.B.C.D <1-255>
    ip route A.B.C.D/M IFNAME <1-255>
  
    If the least distance value's route's nexthop are unreachable,
  select the least distance value route which has reachable nexthop is
  selected.
  
    ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.0.0.1
    ip route 0.0.0.0/0 11.0.0.1 2
  
    In this case, when 10.0.0.1 is unreachable and 11.0.0.1 is
  reachable.  The route with nexthop 11.0.0.1 will be installed into
  forwarding table.
  
    zebra> show ip route
    S>* 0.0.0.0/0 [2/0] via 11.0.0.1
    S   0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 10.0.0.1 inactive
  
    If the nexthop is unreachable "inactive" is displayed.  You can
  specify any string to IFNAME.  There is no need of the interface is
  there when you configure the route.
  
    ip route 1.1.1.1/32 ppp0
  
  When ppp0 comes up, the route is installed properly.

*** Multiple nexthop routes for one prefix

    Multiple nexthop routes can be specified for one prefix.  Even the
  kernel support only one nexthop for one prefix user can configure
  multiple nexthop.
  
    When you configure routes like below, prefix 10.0.0.1 has three
  nexthop.
  
    ip route 10.0.0.1/32 10.0.0.2
    ip route 10.0.0.1/32 10.0.0.3
    ip route 10.0.0.1/32 eth0
  
    If there is no route to 10.0.0.2 and 10.0.0.3.  And interface eth0
    is reachable, then the last route is installed into the kernel.
  
    zebra> show ip route
    S>  10.0.0.1/32 [1/0] via 10.0.0.2 inactive
                          via 10.0.0.3 inactive
      *                   is directly connected, eth0
  
    '*' means this nexthop is installed into the kernel. 

*** Multipath (more than one nexthop for one prefix) can be installed into the kernel.

    When the kernel support multipath, zebra can install multipath
  routes into the kernel.  Before doing that please make it sure that
  setting --enable-multipath=ARG to configure script.  ARG must be digit
  value.  When specify 0 to ARG, there is no limitation of the number
  of the multipath.  Currently only GNU/Linux with netlink interface is
  supported.
  
    ip route 10.0.0.1/32 10.0.0.2
    ip route 10.0.0.1/32 10.0.0.3
    ip route 10.0.0.1/32 eth0
  
    zebra> show ip route
    S>* 10.0.0.1/32 [1/0] via 10.0.0.2
      *                   via 10.0.0.3
                          is directly connected, eth0

*** Kernel message delete installed route.

    After zebra install static or dynamic route into the kernel.
  
    R>* 0.0.0.0/0 [120/3] via 10.0.0.1
  
    If you delete this route outside zebra, old zebra does not reinstall
  route again.  Now the route is re-processed and properly reinstall the
  static or dynamic route into the kernel.

** GNU/Linux netlink socket handling is improved to fix race condition
between kernel message and user command responce.

* Changes in bgpd

** Add show neighbor's routes command.

  "show ip bgp neighbors (A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X) routes"
  "show ip bgp ipv4 (unicast|multicast) neighbors (A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X) routes"
  "show ipv6 bgp neighbors (A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X) routes"
  "show ipv6 mbgp neighbors (A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X) routes"

** BGP passive peer support problem is fixed.

** Redistributed IGP nexthop is passed to BGP nexthop.

** On multiaccess media, if the nexthop is reachable nexthop is passed
as it is.

** Remove zebra-0.88 compatibility commands.

  "match ip prefix-list WORD"
  "match ipv6 prefix-list WORD"

  Instead of above please use below commands.

  "match ip address prefix-list WORD"
  "match ipv6 address prefix-list WORD"

** Fix bug of holdtimer is not reset when bgp cleared.

** "show ip bgp summary" display peer establish/drop count.

** Change "match ip next-hop" argument from IP address to access-list
name.

** When "bgp enforce-first-as" is enabled, check EBGP peer's update
has it's AS number in the first AS number in AS sequence.

** New route-map command "set community-delete COMMUNITY-LIST" is
added.  Community matched the CoMMUNITY-LIST is removed from the
community.

** BGP-MIB implementation is finished.

** When BGP connection comes from unconfigured IP address, close
socket immediately.

** Do not compare router ID when the routes comes from EBGP peer.
When originator ID is same, take shorter cluster-list route.  If
cluster-list is same take smaller IP address neighbor's route.

** Add "bgp bestpath as-path ignore" command.  When this option is
set, do not concider AS path length when route selection.

** Add "bgp bestpath compare-routerid".  When this option is set,
compare router ID when the routes comes from EBGP peer.

** Add "bgp deterministic-med" process.

** BGP flap dampening feature is added.

** When IBGP nexthop is changed, it is reflected to RIB.

** Change "neighbor route-refresh" command to "neighbor capability
route-refresh".

* Changes in ripd

** Change "match ip next-hop" argument from IP address to access-list
name.

** "no ip rip (send|receive)" command accept version number argument.

** Memory leak related classfull network generation is fixed.

** When a route is in garbage collection process (invalid with metric
16) and a router receives the same route with valid metric then route
was not installed into zebra rib, but only into ripd rib. Moreover ,
it will never get into zebra rib, because ripd wrongly assumes it's
already there.

* Change in ospfd

** Fix bug of refreshing default route.

** --enable-nssa turn on undergoing NSSA feature.

** Fix bug of Hello packet's option is not properly set when interface
comes up.

** Reduce unconditional logging.

** Add nexthop to OSPF path only when it is not there.

** When there is no DR on network (suppose you have only one router
with interface priority 0). It's router LSA does not contain the link
information about this network.

** When you change a priority of interface from/to 0
ISM_NeighborChange event should be scheduled in order to elect new
DR/BDR on the network.

** When we add some LSA into retransmit list we need to check whether
the present old LSA in retransmit list is not more recent than the new
one.

** In states Loading and Full the slave must resend its last Database
Description packet in response to duplicate Database Description
packets received from the master.  For this reason the slave must wait
RouterDeadInterval seconds before freeing the last Database
Description packet. Reception of a Database Description packet from
the master after this interval will generate a SeqNumberMismatch
neighbor event. RFC2328 Section 10.8

** Virtual link can not configured in stub area.

** Clear a ls_upd_queue queue of the interface when interface goes
down.

** "no router ospf" unregister redistribution requests from zebra.

** New command for virtual-link configuration is added.

  "area A.B.C.D virtual-link A.B.C.D"
  "area A.B.C.D virtual-link A.B.C.D hello-interval <1-65535> retransmit-interval <3-65535> transmit-delay <1-65535> dead-interval <1-65535>"
  "area A.B.C.D virtual-link A.B.C.D hello-interval <1-65535> retransmit-interval <3-65535> transmit-delay <1-65535> dead-interval <1-65535> authentication-key AUTH_KEY"
  "area A.B.C.D virtual-link A.B.C.D authentication-key AUTH_KEY"
  "area A.B.C.D virtual-link A.B.C.D hello-interval <1-65535> retransmit-interval <3-65535> transmit-delay <1-65535> dead-interval <1-65535> message-digest-key <1-255> md5 KEY"
  "area A.B.C.D virtual-link A.B.C.D message-digest-key <1-255> md5 KEY"

** Clear cryptographic sequence number when neighbor status is changed
to NSM down.

** Make Summary LSA's origination and refreshment as same as other
type of LSA.

** New OSPF pakcet read method. Now maximum packet length may be 65535
bytes (maximum IP packet length).

** Checking the age of the found LSA and if the LSA is MAXAGE we
should call refresh instead of originate.

** Install multipath information to zebra.

** Fix socket descriptor leak when system call failed.

* Changes in ospf6d

** Whole functionality has been rewritten as new code. new command
"show ipv6 ospf6 spf node", "show ipv6 ospf6 spf tree", "show ipv6
ospf6 spf table" has been added.

** Change to do not send garbage route whose nexthop is not linklocal
address.

** "redistribute ospf6" was generated in "router ospf6" in config
file. It is fixed.

** LSDB sync bug is fixed.

** Fix bug of using unavailable route.

* Changes in vtysh

** route-map and access-list configuration is merged into one
configuration.

** /usr/local/etc/Zebra.conf is integrated configuration file.  "write
memory" in vtysh will write whole configuration to this file.

** When -b option is specified to vtysh, vtysh read
/usr/local/etc/Zebra.conf file then pass the confuguration to proper
protocol daemon.  So make all protocol daemon's configuration file
empty then invoke all daemon.  After that vtysh -b will setup saved
configuration.

* Changes in zebra-0.84

* Changes in lib

** IPv6 address and prefix parser is added to VTY by Toshiaki Takada
   <takada@zebra.org>.  DEFUN string is "X:X::X:X" for IPv6 address,
   "X:X::X:X/M" for IPv6 prefix.  You can use it like this.

   DEFUN (func, cmd, "neighbor (A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X) remote-as <1-65535>")

** VTY configuration is locked during configuration.  This is for
   avoiding unconditional crush from two terminals modify the
   configuration at the same time.  "who" command shows which termnal
   lock the configuration.  VTY which has '*' character at the head of
   line is locking the configuration.

** Old logging functions are removed.  Functions like
   log_open,log_close,openlog are deleted.  Instead of that please use
   zlog_* functions.  zvlog_* used in ospf6d are deleted also.

** "terminal monitor" command is added.  "no terminal monitor" is for
   disabling.  This command simply display logging information to the
   VTY.

** dropline.[ch] files are deleted.

* Changes in bgpd

   without specifying AS number.

** "no neighbor ebgp-multihop" command is added.

** "no neighbor port PORT" command is added.

** To conform RFC1771, "neighbor PEER send-community" is default
   behavior.  If you want to disable sending community attribute,
   please specify "no neighbor PEER send-community" to the peer.

** "neighbor maximum-prefix NUMBER" command is added.

** Multi-protocol extention NLRI is proceeded only when the peer is
   configured proper Address Family and Subsequent Address Family.  If
   not, those NLRI are simply ignored.

** Aggregate-address support is improved.  Currently below commands
   works.

  "aggregate-address"
  "aggregate-address summary-only"
  "no aggregate-address"

   this command, you have to configure neighbor with
   "neighbor A.B.C.D soft-reconfiguration inbound" beforehand.
   

* Changes in zebra-0.83

* bgpd

** Serious bug fix about fetching global and link-local address at the
same time.  Due to this bug, corrupted IPv6 prefix is generated.  If
you uses bgpd for BGP-4+ please update to this version.  The bug is
introduced in zebra-0.82.

** When bgpd send Notify message, don't use thread manager.  It is now
send to neighbor immediately.

* Changes in zebra-0.82

** Solaris 2.6 support is added by Michael Handler
<handler@sub-rosa.com>.

** MBGP support is added by Robert Olsson <Robert.Olsson@data.slu.se>.
Please specify --enable-mbgp to configure script.  This option will be
removed in the future and MBGP support will be default.

* Changes in zebra

** When interface goes down, withdraw connected routes from routing
table.  When interface goes up, restore the routes to the routing
table.

** `show interface' show interface's statistics on Linux and BSD with
routing socket.

** Now zebra can get MTU value on BSDI/OS.

* Changes in bgpd

* Changes in zebra-0.81

** SNMP support is disabled in default.--enable-snmp option is added
to configure script.

* Changes in bgpd

** Fix FSM bug which introduced in zebra-0.80.

* Changes in zebra-0.80

* access-list

  New access-list name space `ipv6 access-list' is added.  At the same
  time, `access-list' statemant only accepts IPv4 prefix.  Please be
  careful if you use IPv6 filtering.  You will need to change your
  configuration.  For IPv6 filtering please use `ipv6 access-list'.
  
  As of zebra-0.7x, user can use `access-list' for both IPv4 and IPv6
  filtering.
  
  ! zebra-0.7x
  access-list DML-net permit 203.181.89.0/24
  access-list DML-net permit 3ffe:506::0/32
  access-list DML-net deny any
  !
  
  Above configuration is not valid for zebra-08x.  Please add `ipv6'
  before 'access-list' when you configure IPv6 filtering.
  
  ! zebra-0.8x
  access-list DML-net permit 203.181.89.0/24
  access-list DML-net deny any
  !
  ipv6 access-list DML-net permit 3ffe:506::0/32
  ipv6 access-list DML-net deny any
  !

* prefix-list

  And also new prefix-list name space `ipv6 prefix-list' is added.  It
  is the same as the change of `access-list'. `ip prefix-list' now only
  accept IPv4 prefix.  It was source of confusion that `ip prefix-list'
  can be used both IPv4 and IPv6 filtering.  Now name space is separated
  to clear the meaning of the filter.
  
  If you use `ip prefix-list' for IPv6 filtering, please change the
  stetement.
  
  ! zebra-0.7x
  ip prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 5 permit 3ffe::/17 le 24 ge 24
  ip prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 10 permit 3ffe:8000::/17 le 28 ge 28
  ip prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 12 deny 3ffe::/16
  ip prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 15 permit 2000::/3 le 16 ge 16
  ip prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 20 permit 2001::/16 le 35 ge 35
  ip prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 30 deny any
  !
  
  Now user can explicitly configure it as IPv6 prefix-list.
  
  ! zebra-0.8x
  ipv6 prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 5 permit 3ffe::/17 le 24 ge 24
  ipv6 prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 10 permit 3ffe:8000::/17 le 28 ge 28
  ipv6 prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 12 deny 3ffe::/16
  ipv6 prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 15 permit 2000::/3 le 16 ge 16
  ipv6 prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 20 permit 2001::/16 le 35 ge 35
  ipv6 prefix-list 6bone-filter seq 30 deny any
  !

* RIP configuration

  If you want to filter only default route (0.0.0.0/0) and permit other
  routes, it was hard to do that.  Now `ip prefix-list' can be used for
  RIP route filtering.
  
  New statement:
  
  `distribute-list prefix PLIST_NAME (in|out) IFNAME'
  
  is added to ripd.  So you can configure on eth0 interface accept all
  routes other than default routes.
  
  !
  router rip
   distribute-list prefix filter-default in eth0
  !
  ip prefix-list filter-default deny 0.0.0.0/0 le 0
  ip prefix-list filter-default permit any
  !

* RIPng configuration

  Same change is done for ripngd.  You can use `ipv6 prefix-list' for
  filtering.
  
  !
  router ripng
   distribute-list prefix filter-default in eth0
  !
  ipv6 prefix-list filter-default deny ::/0 le 0
  ipv6 prefix-list filter-default permit any
  !

* BGP configuration

  So far, Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 (RFC2283) configuration is
  done with traditional IPv4 peering statement like blow.
  
  !
  router bgp 7675
   neighbor 3ffe:506::1 remote-as 2500
   neighbor 3ffe:506::1 prefix-list 6bone-filter out
  !
  
  For separating configuration IPv4 and IPv6, and for retaining Cisco
  configuration compatibility, now IPv6 configuration is done by IPv6
  specific statement.  IPv6 BGP configuration is done by statement which
  start from `ipv6 bgp'.
  
  !
  router bgp 7675
  !
  ipv6 bgp neighbor 3ffe:506::1 remote-as 2500
  ipv6 bgp neighbor 3ffe:506::1 prefix-list 6bone-filter out
  !
  
  At the same time some IPv6 specific commands are deleted from IPv4
  configuration.
  
  o redistribute ripng
  o redistribute ospf6
  o neighbor PEER version BGP_VERSION
  o neighbor PEER interface IFNAME
  
  Those commands are only accepted as like below.
  
  o ipv6 bgp redistribute ripng
  o ipv6 bgp redistribute ospf6
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER version BGP_VERSION
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER interface IFNAME
  
  And below new commands are added.
  
  o ipv6 bgp network IPV6_PREFIX
  o ipv6 bgp redistribute static
  o ipv6 bgp redistribute connected
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER remote-as <1-65535> [passive]
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER ebgp-multihop [TTL]
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER description DESCRIPTION
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER shutdown
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER route-reflector-client
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER update-source IFNAME
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER next-hop-self
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER timers holdtime <0-65535>
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER timers keepalive <0-65535>
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER send-community
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER weight <0-65535>
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER default-originate
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER filter-list FILTER_LIST_NAME (in|out)
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER prefix-list PREFIX_LIST_NAME (in|out)
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER distribute-list AS_LIST_NAME (in|out)
  o ipv6 bgp neighbor PEER route-map ROUTE_MAP_NAME (in|out)
  
  And some utility commands are introduced.
  
  o clear ipv6 bgp [PEER]
  o show ipv6 bgp neighbors [PEER]
  o show ipv6 bgp summary
  
  I hope these changes are easy to understand for current Zebra users...

* To restrict connection to VTY interface.

  It used to be both IPv4 and IPv6 filter can be specified with one
  access-list.  Then the access-list can be appried to VTY interface
  with `access-class' stetement in `line vty' node.  Below is example in
  zebra-0.7x.
  
  !
  access-list local-only permit 127.0.0.1/32
  access-list local-only permit ::1/128
  access-list local-only deny any
  !
  line vty
   access-class local-only
  !
  
  Now IPv4 and IPv6 filter have each name space.  It is not possible to
  specify IPv4 and IPv6 filter with one access-list.  For setting IPv6
  access-list in `line vty', `ipv6 access-class' statement is
  introduced.  Let me show the configuration in zebra-0.8x.
  
  !
  access-list local-only permit 127.0.0.1/32
  access-list local-only deny any
  !
  ipv6 access-list local-only permit ::1/128
  ipv6 access-list local-only dny any
  !
  line vty
   access-class local-only
   ipv6 access-class local-only
  !

* route-map

  New IPv6 related route-map match commands are added.
  
  o match ipv6 address
  o match ipv6 next-hop
  
  Please change your configuration if you use IP match statement for
  IPv6 route.
  
  zebra-0.7x config
  =================
  !
  access-list all permit any
  !
  route-map set-nexthop permit 10
   match ip address all
   set ipv6 next-hop global 3ffe:506::1
   set ipv6 next-hop local fe80::cbb5:591a
  !
  
  zebra-0.8x config
  =================
  !
  ipv6 access-list all permit any
  !
  route-map set-nexthop permit 10
   match ipv6 address all
   set ipv6 next-hop global 3ffe:506::1
   set ipv6 next-hop local fe80::cbb5:591a
  !

* zebra connection

  Protocol daemon such as ripd, bgpd, ospfd will reconnect zebra daemon
  when the connection fail.  Those daemons try to connect zebra every 10
  seconds first three trial, then the interval changed to 60 seconds.
  After all, if ten connections are fail, protocol daemon give up the
  connection to the zebra daemon.

* SNMP support (is not yet finished)

  Zebra uses SMUX protocol (RFC1227) for making communication with SNMP
  agent.  Currently lib/smux.c can be compiled only with ucd-snmp-4.0.1
  and http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/patches/012.patch.  It can not be
  compiled with ucd-snmp-3.6.2.
  
  After applying the patch to ucd-snmp-4.0.1, please configure it with
  SMUX module.
  
  % configure --with-mib-modules=smux
  
  After compile & install ucd-snmp-4.0.1, you will need to configure
  smuxpeer.  I'm now using below configuration.
  
  /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.conf
  ================================
  smuxpeer 1.3.6.1.6.3.1 test
  
  Above 1.3.6.1.6.3.1 and test is temporary configuration which is hard
  coded in lib/smux.c. Yes, I know it is bad, I'll change it ASAP.

* HUP signal treatment

  From zebra-0.80, ripd will reload it's configuration file when ripd
  receives HUP signal.  Other daemon such as bgpd, ospfd will support
  HUP signal treatment soon.
