.TH curl_easy_escape 3 "February 03, 2016" "libcurl 5.5.5" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_easy_escape - URL encodes the given string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "char *curl_easy_escape( CURL *" curl ", const char *" string
.BI ", int "length " );"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function converts the given input \fIstring\fP to a URL encoded string
and returns that as a new allocated string. All input characters that are not
a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '-', '.', '_' or '~' are converted to their "URL escaped"
version (%NN where NN is a two-digit hexadecimal number).

If \fIlength\fP is set to 0 (zero), \fIcurl_easy_escape(3)\fP uses strlen() on
the input \fIstring\fP to find out the size.

You must \fIcurl_free(3)\fP the returned string when you're done with it.
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.15.4 and replaces the old \fIcurl_escape(3)\fP function.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A pointer to a zero terminated string or NULL if it failed.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  char *output = curl_easy_escape(curl, "data to convert", 15);
  if(output) {
    printf("Encoded: %s\\n", output);
    curl_free(output);
  }
}
