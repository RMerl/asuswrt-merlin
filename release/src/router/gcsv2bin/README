gcsv2bin Readme file
-------------------------

gcsv2bin is a tool specially written for the iptables/netfilter's geoip
match purpose. This file won't discuss about the iptables/netfilter's framework.
www.netfilter.org for details.

gcsv2bin's only task is to convert a comma-seperated-value database containing
all IPv4 subnets and their associated countries to a  binary format for the iptables'
geoip shared library.

You can create your own database (perhaps you feel sado) or simply gets the
latest GeoIP's free database from MaxMind. This product includes GeoIP data
created by MaxMind, available from http://maxmind.com/
