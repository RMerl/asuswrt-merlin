FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES:
-------------------------------

Compiling the source code:
%make
Put the files in the right directories:
%make install

If you are using the CVS code or need your own kernel includes, do this
instead (change the include directory to the appropriate one):
%make install KERNEL_INCLUDES=/usr/src/linux/include

If you want to make a static binary for ebtables, containing all the
extensions, without shared libraries, do this (this will make a
binary called 'static', which you can rename):
%make static

WHAT GETS INSTALLED?
--------------------

- The ebtables manual gets installed in /usr/local/man/man8
  To put the manual somewhere else, include MANDIR=<<man-path/man>> as
  option on the command line.
  The Makefile will append /man8/ebtables.8.
- ethertypes is by default placed in /etc/, if you
  want to change this, include ETHERTYPESPATH=<<path>>.
- The userspace programs ebtables ebtables-save and ebtables-restore are
  are copied by default to /usr/local/sbin/ebtables. If you want to put
  the executables somewhere else, include BINPATH=<<path>>.
- The ebtables initialisation file (enabling use of 'service ebtables') is
  copied to /etc/rc.d/init.d (change with option INITDIR)
- The ebtables configuration file (ebtables-config) is copied to /etc/sysconfig

That's all

You can also use a base directory different from the root directory (/),
using the DESTDIR option. See the Makefile for more details.


ADDITIONAL PROGRAM(S):
----------------------
-- examples/ulog/test_ulog.c --

Contains an example to receive and parse netlink messages containing
packets seen by the ebtables ulog watcher.

Compile with:
%make test_ulog KERNEL_INCLUDES=/usr/src/linux/include

Usage:
%examples/ulog/test_ulog NETLINK_GROUP
%ebtables -A chain --ulog-nlgroup NETLINK_GROUP

-- examples/perf_test/perf_test --

A test script to compare the performance for the different ways to
construct an ebtables table. This is deprecated and should probably
be ignored.
