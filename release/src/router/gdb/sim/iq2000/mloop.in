# Syntax:
# /bin/sh mainloop.in command
#
# Command is one of:
#
# init
# support
# extract-{simple,scache,pbb}
# {full,fast}-exec-{simple,scache,pbb}
#
# A target need only provide a "full" version of one of simple,scache,pbb.
# If the target wants it can also provide a fast version of same.
# It can't provide more than this, however for illustration's sake the IQ2000
# port provides examples of all.

# ??? After a few more ports are done, revisit.
# Will eventually need to machine generate a lot of this.
