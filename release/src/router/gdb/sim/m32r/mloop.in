# Syntax:
# /bin/sh mainloop.in command
#
# Command is one of:
#
# init
# support
# extract-{simple,scache,pbb}
# {full,fast}-exec-{simple,scache,pbb}
#
# A target need only provide a "full" version of one of simple,scache,pbb.
# If the target wants it can also provide a fast version of same, or if
# the slow (full featured) version is `simple', then the fast version can be
# one of scache/pbb.
# A target can't provide more than this.
# However for illustration's sake this file provides examples of all.

# ??? After a few more ports are done, revisit.
# Will eventually need to machine generate a lot of this.
