# Tests for PR:1431.  Catch gdb not continuing to second function properly.
# Note that originally this bug was reported as a problem with the "until"
# command, which actually is behaving as currently defined.  What apparently
# was expected was the behavior of the newer "advance" command.

# Observe that the until command doesn't go all the way to sub2.
