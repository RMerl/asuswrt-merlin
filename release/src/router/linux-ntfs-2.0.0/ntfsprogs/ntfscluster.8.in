.SH NAME
ntfscluster \- identify files in a specified region of an NTFS volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntfscluster
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntfscluster
has three modes of operation:
.IR info ,
.I sector
and
.IR cluster .
.SS Info
.PP
The default mode,
.I info
is currently not implemented.  It will display general information about the
NTFS volume when it is working.
.SS Sector
.PP
The
.I sector
mode will display a list of files that have data in the specified range of
sectors.
.SS Cluster
The
.I cluster
mode will display a list of files that have data in the specified range of
clusters.  When the cluster size is one sector, this will be equivalent to the
.I sector
mode of operation.
.SH OPTIONS
Below is a summary of all the options that
.B ntfscluster
accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
preceded by
.B \-
and the long name is preceded by
.BR \-\- .
Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
single command, e.g.
.B \-fv
is equivalent to
.BR "\-f \-v" .
Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cluster\fR RANGE
Any files whose data is in this range of clusters will be displayed.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-filename\fR NAME
Show information about this file.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
This will override some sensible defaults, such as not working with a mounted
volume.  Use this option with caution.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-inode\fR NUM
Show information about this inode.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR
This option is not yet implemented.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Reduce the amount of output to a minimum.  Naturally, it doesn't make sense to
combine this option with
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sector\fR RANGE
Any files whose data is in this range of sectors will be displayed.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase the amount of output that
.B ntfscluster
prints.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show the version number, copyright and license for
.BR ntfscluster .
.SH EXAMPLES
Get some information about the volume /dev/hda1.
