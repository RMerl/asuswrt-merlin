* Bugs


** fix translations

** 255.255.255.255 doesn't work with HP-UX gethostbyname


* New features


** better resolving error output


** add option for autoexecuting wol-*? -> install wol-* to ${libexecdir}


** sitewide config (/etc/wol/wol.config) and user config ($HOME/.wolrc)?


** MAC address checking

check if macaddress is valid (look at http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/)


** merge multiple magic packets

magic packets > 1 -> put several packets into one buffer for sending over the line


** ipv6 support

only for interest, cause there is no ipv6-only host out there, huh?


** subnet mask parameter

Hi,

First, thanks for the making your software available via the GPL. I do have one
suggestion to make it even better than it already is: Add an optional subnet
mask parameter. Here's why: Most of the WOL utils use UDP broadcast packets.
These packets work great for waking up devices on the local subnet, however, I
think it is common that these will not get routed (at least that's the case on
our network.) Your util does the opposite, it addresses the packet to the
specific host. These packets get routed just fine, and wake up devices on other
subnets, just as they should. However, they don't work on the local subnet
because the OS will issue an ARP request to find out who has the IP address
(unless the ARP info cached or in a static config file). Of course, the request
fails, so the packet never goes out.  

My thought is that if an optional subnet mask is specified, then both a
broadcast and a directed packet are sent. One of them should get through :-)


** WOL Proxy

wolp (Wake On LAN proxy) support http://etherboot.sf.net/wolp, maybe a reimplementation


** WOL GUI

a graphical frontend with some cool gimmicks?


** make check

automate the testing process
