.SH NAME
ntfs-3g.secaudit \- NTFS Security Data Auditing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntfs-3g.secaudit
\fB[\fIoptions\fP\fB]\fR
.I args
.PP
Where \fIoptions\fP is a combination of :
.RS
-a full auditing of security data (Linux only)
.RE
.RS
-b backup ACLs
.RE
.RS
-e setting extra backed-up parameters (in conjunction with -s)
.RE
.RS
-h displaying hexadecimal security descriptors saved in a file
.RE
.RS
-r recursing in a directory
.RE
.RS
-s setting backed-up ACLs
.RE
.RS
-v verbose (very verbose if set twice)
.RE
.PP
and args define the parameters and the set of files acted upon.
.PP
Typing secaudit with no args will display a summary of available options.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBntfs-3g.secaudit\fR
displays the ownership and permissions of a set of files on an NTFS
file system, and checks their consistency. It can be started in terminal
mode only (no graphical user interface is available.)
.PP
When a \fIvolume\fR is required, it has to be unmounted, and the command
has to be issued as \fBroot\fP. The \fIvolume\fR can be either a block
device (i.e. a disk partition) or an image file.
.PP
When acting on a directory or volume, the command may produce a lot
of information. It is therefore advisable to redirect the output to
a file or pipe it to a text editor for examination.
.SH OPTIONS
Below are the valid combinations of options and arguments that
\fBntfs-3g.secaudit\fR accepts. All the indicated arguments are
mandatory and must be unique (if wildcards are used, they must
resolve to a single name.)
.TP
\fB-h\fP \fIfile\fP
Displays in an human readable form the hexadecimal security descriptors
saved in \fIfile\fP. This can be used to turn a verbose output into a very
verbose output.
.TP
\fB-a[rv]\fP \fIvolume\fP
Audits the volume : all the global security data on \fIvolume\fP are scanned
and errors are displayed. If option \fB-r\fP is present, all files and
directories are also scanned and their relations to global security data
are checked. This can produce a lot of data.

This option is not effective on volumes formatted for old NTFS versions (pre
NTFS 3.0). Such volumes have no global security data.

When errors are signalled, it is advisable to repair the volume with an
appropriate tool (such as \fBchkdsk\fP on Windows.)
.TP
\fB[-v]\fP \fIvolume\fP \fIfile\fP
Displays the security parameters of \fIfile\fP : its interpreted Linux mode
(rwx flags in octal) and Posix ACL[1], its security key if any, and its
security descriptor if verbose output.
.TP
\fB-r[v]\fP \fIvolume\fP \fIdirectory\fP
displays the security parameters of all files and subdirectories in
\fIdirectory\fP : their interpreted Linux mode (rwx flags in octal) and Posix
ACL[1], their security key if any, and their security descriptor if
verbose output.
.TP
.B -b[v] \fIvolume\fP \fI[directory]\fP
Recursively extracts to standard output the NTFS ACLs of files in \fIvolume\fP
and \fIdirectory\fP.
.TP
\fB-s[ev]\fP \fIvolume\fP \fI[backup-file]\fP
Sets the NTFS ACLS as indicated in \fIbackup-file\fP or standard input. The
input data must have been created on Linux. With option \fB-e\fP, also sets
extra parameters (currently Windows attrib).
.TP
\fIvolume\fP \fIperms\fP \fIfile\fP
Sets the security parameters of file to perms. Perms is the Linux
requested mode (rwx flags, expressed in octal form as in chmod) or
a Posix ACL[1] (expressed like in setfacl -m). This sets a new ACL
which is effective for Linux and Windows.
.TP
\fB-r[v]\fP \fIvolume\fP \fIperms\fP \fIdirectory\fP
Sets the security parameters of all files and subdirectories in
\fIdirectory\fP to \fIperms\fP. Perms is the Linux requested mode (rwx flags,
expressed in octal form as in \fBchmod\fP), or a Posix ACL[1] (expressed like
in \fBsetfacl -m\fP.) This sets new ACLs which are effective for Linux and
Windows.
.TP
\fB[-v]\fP \fImounted-file\fP
Displays the security parameters of \fImounted-file\fP : its interpreted
Linux mode (rwx flags in octal) and Posix ACL[1], its security key if any,
and its security descriptor if verbose output. This is a special case which
acts on a mounted file (or directory) and does not require being root. The
Posix ACL interpretation can only be displayed if the full path to
\fImounted-file\fP from the root of the global file tree is provided.
.SH NOTE
[1] provided the POSIX ACL option was selected at compile time. A Posix ACL
specification looks like "\fB[d:]{ugmo}:[id]:[perms],...\fP" where id is a
numeric user or group id, and perms an octal digit or a set from the letters
r, w and x.
.RS
Example : "\fBu::7,g::5,o:0,u:510:rwx,g:500:5,d:u:510:7\fP"
