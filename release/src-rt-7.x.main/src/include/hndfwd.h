 * HND Forwarder between GMAC and "HW switching capable WLAN interfaces".
 *
 * Northstar router includes 3 GMAC ports from the integrated switch to the Host
 * (single or dual core) CPU. The integrated switch provides advanced ethernet
 * hardware switching functions, similar to that of a Linux software bridge.
 * In Northstar, this integrated HW switch is responsible for bridging packets
 * between the 4 LAN ports. All LAN ports are seen by the ethernet network
 * device driver as a single "vlan1" interface. This single vlan1 interface
 * represents the collection of physical LAN ports on the switch, without
 * having to create a seperate interface per LAN port and  adding each one of
 * these LAN interfaces to the default Linux software LAN bridge "br0".
 * The hardware switch allows the LAN ports to be segregated into multiple
 * bridges using VLAN (Independent VLAN Learning Mode). Again, each subset of
 * physical LAN ports are represented by a single interface, namely "vlanX".
 *
 * The 3 GMAC configuration treats the primary WLAN interface as just another
 * LAN interface (albeit with a WLAN 802.11 MAC as opposed to an Ethernet 802.3
 * MAC). Two of the three GMACs are dedicated for binding the primary WLAN
 * interfaces to the HW switch which performs the LAN to WLAN bridging function.
 * These two GMACs are referred to as Forwarding GMACs.
 * The third GMAC is used to connect the switch to the Linux router network
 * stack, by making all LAN and WLAN ports appear as a single vlan1 interface
 * that is added to the software Linux bridge "br0". This GMAC is referred to
 * as the Networking GMAC.
 *
 * Similar to LAN to WAN routing, where LAN originated packets would be flooded
 * to the WAN port via the br0, likewise, WLAN originated packets would re-enter
 * Linux network stack via the 3rd GMAC. Software Cut-Through-Forwarding CTF
 * will accelerate WLAN <-> WAN traffic. When the hardware Flow Accelerator is
 * enabled, WLAN <-> WAN traffic need not re-enter the host CPU, other than the
 * first few packets that are needed to establish the flows in the FA, post
 * DPI or Security related flow classification functions.
 *
 * +----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A typical GMAC configuration is:
 *   GMAC#0 - port#5 - fwd0 <---> wl0/eth1 (radio 0) on CPU core0
 *   GMAC#1 - port#7 - fwd1 <---> wl1/eth2 (radio 1) on CPU core1
 *
 *   GMAC#2 - port#8 - eth0 <--- vlan1 ---> br0
 *
 * Here, analogous to all physical LAN ports are managed by vlan1, likewise the
 * port#5 and port#7 are also treated as "LAN" ports hosting a "WiFI" MAC.
 *
 * In such a configuration, the primary wl interfaces wl0 and wl1 (i.e. eth1 and
 * eth2) are not added to the Linux bridge br0, as the integrated HW switch will
 * handle all LAN <---> WLAN bridging functions. All LAN ports and the WLAN
 * interface are represented by vlan1. vlan1 is added to the Linux bridge br0.
 *
 * The switch port#8, is IMP port capable (Integrated Management Port). All
 * routed LAN and WAN traffic are directed to this port, where the eth0 network
 * interface is responsible for directing to the network stack. The eth0 network
 * interface uses the presence of a VLAN=1 to differentiate from WAN
 * originating packets.
 *
 * The same ethernet driver is instantiated per GMAC, and is flavored as a
 * Forwarder (GMAC#0 and GMAC#1) or a Network interface (GMAC#2). The Forwarder
 * GMAC(s) are not added to any Linux SW bridge, and are responsible to
 * receive/transmit packets from/to the integrated switch on behalf of the
 * HW switching capable WLAN interfaces.
 *
 * hndfwd.h provides the API for the GMAC Fwder device driver and wl driver
 * to register their respective transmit bypass handlers.
 *
 * An upstream forwarder object forwards traffic received from a GMAC to a
 * WLAN intreface for transmission. Likewise a downstream forwarder object
 * forwards traffic received from a WLAN interface to the GMAC. The upstream
 * and downstream forwarder, together act as a bi-directional socket.
 *
 * In a single core Northstar (47081), a pair of bidirectional forwarder objects
 * are maintained, indexed by the GMAC and WLAN radio fwder_unit number.
 *
 * In a dual core SMP Northstar, the bidirectional forwarder objects are defined
 * as per CPU instances. Each GMAC forwarder driver and mated WLAN interface are
 * tied to the appropriate CPU core using their respective fwder_unit number
 * and they access the per CPU core forwarder object by using the fwder_unit
 * number to retrieve the per CPU instance.
 *
 * In Atlas, where multiple radios may share the same IRQ, the two radios must
 * be hosted on the same CPU core. A "fwder_cpumap" nvram variable defines
 * the mode, channel, band, irq, and cpucore assignment, for all (3) radios.
 * The nvram variable is parsed and a unique fwder_unit number is assigned to
 * each radio such that radios that shared IRQ will use the same GMAC fwder.
 *
 * MultiBSS Radio:
 * Packets forwarded by the integrated switch only identify a port on which a
 * radio resides. In a Multi BSS configuration, a radio may host multipe virtual
 * interfaces that may avail of HW switching ("br0"). Each primary or virtual
 * interface registers an explicit Linux netdevice and WLAN interface in which
 * context the transmission occurs. In such a MBSS configuration, a packet
 * forwarded by a GMAC for WLAN transmission needs to first identify the virtual
 * interface, detected by the Ethernet MAC DA.
 *
 * +----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * WLAN Offload Forwarding Assist (WOFA)
 * HND Forwarder provides a Mac address to interface mapping table using an
 * abstraction of a dictionary of symbols. A symbol is a 6 Byte Ethernet MAC
 * address. A single dictionary is instantiated per GMAC forwarder pair.
 *
 * In this use case, the dictionary is managed by the WLAN driver. Symbols are
 * added or deleted on Association/Reassociation and Deassociation events
 * respectively, representing the address associated with the station.
 * When a symbol is added to the WOFA dictionary an opaque metadata is also
 * added. In the NIC mode, this metadata is the network device associated with
 * the WLAN interface. In the DGL mode, the metadata may encode the flow ring.
 * The metadata may be used to locate the wl_info/dhd_info, the interface and
 * any other information such as the queue associated with the flow ring.
 *
 * In the GMAC to WLAN direction, a lookup of the MAC DstAddress is performed
 * within wl_forward(bound bypass WLAN forwarding handler). The lookup returns
 * the WLAN interface (from which the registered Linux net_device and wl_info
 * object is derived).
 *
 * In the wl_sendup, path a lookup is also performed to determine whether the
 * packet has to be locally bridged. WOFA's bloom filter is used to quickly
 * terminate the lookup, and proceed with forwarding to the GMAC fwder.
 *
 * Broadcast packets would be flooded to all bound wl interfaces.
 *
 * If deassociation events may get dropped, a periodic synchronization of the
 * dictionary with the list of associated stations needs to be performed.
 *
 * WOFA's uses a 3 step lookup:
 * Stage 1. WOFA caches the most recent hit entry. If this entry matches, then
 *          the hash table is directly looked up.
 * Stage 2. A single hash based bloom filter is looked up. A negative filter
 *          avoids the need to further search the hash table.
 * Stage 3. A search of the hash table using a 4bin per bucket search is used.
 *
 * In devices where the source port number can be determined (BRCM tag), the
 * stage 1 lookup can benefit from back-to-back packets arriving for the same
 * Mac DstAddress.
 *
 * The bloom filter uses a simple multi word bitmap and a single hash function
 * for filtering. The bloom filter mwbmap assumes a 32bit architecture. As the
 * bloom filter can have false positives, an exact match by searching the hash
 * table is performed. The bloom-filter serves in quickly determining whether
 * a further exact match lookup is necessary. This is done to limit CPU cycles
 * for packets that are not destined to WOFA managed interfaces.
