#  For 4707/8/9 - Required to set the DDR PHY clock correctly *before*
#  the boot code is copied to DDR. Since the NVRAM parsing is done
#  after the execution is passed to DDR, the DDR PHY clock must be
#  reconfigured from its default of 333MHz. This parameter is stored
#  in a fixed location in the CFE space, the bootloader can read it
#  while XIP processing is still active. This is a limitation of the
#  way the DDR PHY clock reconfiguration occurs on 4708x parts.

# Set DDR clock of 533MHz (800MT/s) for 4708r

# parameter is nearly always "0".
et0mdcport=0

# Set the MAC address of the Ethernet ports
# From 9/2009 onward MAC addresses have changed from that 8/16 split to a 12/12 split, so the new macmid will be
# based on MAC addresses with the following format:
#   47   40 39   32 31   24 23   16 15    8 7     0
#  |  00   |  90   |  4C   |  XX   |  XY   |  YY   |
# where the low 24 bits are evenly split into 4096 interface/ boardtypes and 4096 serial numbers. The low nibble of
# XXX cannot be 0, since that corresponds to an old style MAC address, and macmid will correspond to bits 22:12, so
# its easy to differentiate them from the old ones.
#
# The new "macmid" values will start at 1 and go up to 0xFFF, skipping those that have the low nibble as 0 and the
# ones with the patterns 0x04Ex and 0x04Fx (These restrictions are enforced in the code). To form the mac address,
# the whole OUI (00:90:4C) will be prepended to those values and 12 bits of serial number will be appended.
#
# A new-style macmid:
#   BCM947186nrh  0x008
#
# For router boards, nvserial now defines a new variable: "maclo12"
# so nvram text files for new boards will have to define the MAC address like this (for a macmid 0x008):
#   et0macaddr=00:90:4C:00:8${maclo12}
# instead of the previous way:

# vlan2 is the WAN. The "u" configures the switch to not add vlan tags for packets to/from the

# If the board is a dual band design the second wireless interface (usually the "a" band)
# will come up as a second device. But we have to tell the software to hook to this

# The WAN port is almost always on an Ethernet port so use the normal config. If the WAN

# NOTE: If WAN packets are vlan tagged, then must use "vlan2" in place of "et0".
#       For the default case of no WAN vlan tags, then must use "et0".
# NOTE: If the board does not have a WAN port then must use "wandevs=".

# If the board has a USB power control chip, then the parameter "gpioX=usbportY" is used to tell
# the USB driver code that it needs to set that GPIO HIGH to turn on power to that USB port.
# "X" is the GPIO number, 0-31. "Y" is the USB port number, starting at "1".

# For a PCIe interface to the wireless chip, these parameters must have a special prefix. There are two formats for this prefix:
# The old format is:
#   pci/<bus_#>/<slot_#>/<param>
#
#   where: <bus_#> is the PCIe bus number. It is the RC (root complex) number + 1.
#             (Ex: bus_# = 1 for the first RC/PCIe port. bus_# = 2 for the second RC/PCIe port.)
#          <slot_#> slot number is always "1" for PCIe.
#          <param> is the parameter assignment. i.e. "boardflags=0x0000A248"
#
# The new format is:
#   pcie/<domain_#>/<bus_#>/<param>     NOTE the first part of the parameter is "pcie", not "pci".
#
#   where: <domain_#> is the PCIe RC (root complex) number + 1. I.E. for PCIe port "PCI0" the domain number is "1".
#          <bus_#> is the PCIe bus number
#             This is alwasy "1" unless the wireless chip is behind a PCIe switch chip, then it will be a higher number.
#             What that number is depends upon the switch chip and what downstream port of the swtich chip the wireless
#             chip is connected to.
#               For a PXL PEX8603 PCIe switch chip, it's downstream port #1 is bus_# 3, and port #2 is bus_# 4.
#          <param> is the parameter assignment. i.e. "boardflags=0x0000A248"

# The 43602 2.4GHz high power RF section, like on the 43602mch2 P102, using sromrev=11, is connected to port #2 of the PLX PEX8603
# PCIe switch, which is connected to port #0 of the 4709. So the domain_#=1, bus_#=4 in the new format. (bus_#=4, slot_#=1 in the old format)

# Due to the increasing number of NVRAM parameters being added with new wireless chips, sometimes the NVRAM will grow too
# large and not fit in the 4K allocated to it in the CFE image. In order to compress the NVRAM somewhat, the
# "devpathX=<prefix>" notation can be used.
#
# The "devpathX" parameters set an abbreviated notation to replace a prefix. The notation for the abbreviated prefix
# is "X:", where X is the same number as used in the "devpathX=<prefix>" definition.
#
# For example, if "devpath1=pcie/1/1/" is set, then instead of using the full "pcie/1/1/" prefix, the abbreviation "2:" is used as the prefix.
#
# NOTE: With the use of compressed eNVRAM there is no longer a need to use "devpathX" parameters, and the full prefixes should be used.
#
#devpath0=pcie/1/4/
