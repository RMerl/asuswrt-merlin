# For 4707/8/9 - Required to set the DDR PHY clock correctly *before* the boot code is copied to DDR. Since the NVRAM
# parsing is done after the execution is passed to DDR, the DDR PHY clock must be reconfigured from its default of
# 333MHz. The "sdram_ncdl" parameter is stored in a fixed location in the CFE space, so the bootloader can read it while
# still executing from flash. This is a limitation of the way the DDR PHY clock reconfiguration occurs on 4707/8/9 parts.

# Set the MAC address of the Ethernet ports
# From 9/2009 onward MAC addresses have changed from that 8/16 split to a 12/12 split, so the new macmid will be
# based on MAC addresses with the following format:
#   47   40 39   32 31   24 23   16 15    8 7     0
#  |  00   |  90   |  4C   |  XX   |  XY   |  YY   |
# where the low 24 bits are evenly split into 4096 interface/ boardtypes and 4096 serial numbers. The low nibble of
# XXX cannot be 0, since that corresponds to an old style MAC address, and macmid will correspond to bits 23:12, so
# its easy to differentiate them from the old ones.
#
# The new "macmid" values will start at 1 and go up to 0xFFF, skipping those that have the low nibble as 0 and the
# ones with the patterns 0x04Ex and 0x04Fx (These restrictions are enforced in the code). To form the mac address,
# the whole OUI (00:90:4C) will be prepended to those values and 12 bits of serial number will be appended.
#
# A new-style macmid:
#   BCM947186nrh  0x008
#
# For router boards, nvserial now defines a new variable: "maclo12"
# so nvram text files for new boards will have to define the MAC address like this (for a macmid 0x008):
#   et0macaddr=00:90:4C:00:8${maclo12}

# The following sections are to configure on-board (WOMBO) 43217 chip, 2.4GHz side, as it does not have an SROM.
# These parameters take the place of the SROM contents. These parameters are for sromrev=9.
# These parameters must have a special prefix. The format is:
#   'pci/<bus_#>/<slot_#>/<param>'
#
#   where: <bus_#> is the PCI/PCIe bus number – always "1" for PCI. For PCIe it is the RC (root complex) number + 1.
#             (Ex: bus_# = 1 for the first RC/PCIe port. bus_# = 2 for the second RC/PCIe port.)
#          <slot_#> slot number of the WOMBO chip (old PCI only. Is always "1" for PCIe.)
#             slot 0 is the RC in the CPU chip (i.e. the 4708)
#             slot = 1 PCI:  if PCI_AD17 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#             slot = 2 PCI:  if PCI_AD18 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#             slot = 3 PCI:  if PCI_AD19 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#          <param> is the parameter assignment. i.e. "boardflags=0x0000A248"

# Due to the increasing number of NVRAM parameters being added with new wireless chips, sometimes the NVRAM will grow too
# large and not fit in the 4K allocated to it in the CFE image. In order to compress the NVRAM somewhat, the
# "devpathX=<prefix>" notation can be used.
#
# In this notation the "<prefix>" value is the usual prefix as decribed above, like "pci/1/1/".
# The "X" in "devpathX" is a unique number from 0-9. Multiple "devpaths" are supported per NVRAM file. This will be
# needed when a board has multiple wireless chips/interfaces. Suggest to start "X" from 0, and count up.
#
# Then for each prefixed NVRAM parameter, the "X:" part is replaced by <prefix> in the NVRAM parser. This saves space by
# reducing the prefix length from about eight characters ("pci/1/1/") down to two ("1:").
#
# Example:
#   Instead of
#     0:boardflags=0x80001200
#     0:boardflags2=0x00100000
#
#   Use the "devpath" notation:
#     devpath0=0:
#     0:boardflags=0x80001200
#     0:boardflags2=0x00100000
#
devpath0=pci/1/1

# PCIe port #0 (bus_#=1, slot_#=1) is for a 4331 2.4GHz high power RF section like on the 4706nr2hmc, using sromrev=9

0:venid=0x14E4

# NOTE: When PCI/PCIe SROM parameters are used in NVRAM, the "0:boardtype", "0:boardrev", and "0:boardnum"
#       parameters should NOT be placed in NVRAM.

# sromrev tells the software what "version" of SROM is used.

# The following sections are to configure the on-board (WOMBO) 4352, 5GHz side, when it does not have an SROM.
# These parameters take the place of the SROM contents. These parameters are for sromrev=9.
# These parameters must have a special prefix. The format is:
#   'pci/<bus_#>/<slot_#>/<param>'
#
#   where: <bus_#> is the PCI/PCIe bus number – always "1" for PCI. For PCIe it is the RC (root complex) number + 1.
#             (Ex: bus_# = 1 for the first RC/PCIe port. bus_# = 2 for the second RC/PCIe port.)
#          <slot_#> slot number of the WOMBO chip (old PCI only. Is always "1" for PCIe.)
#             slot 0 is the RC in the CPU chip (i.e. the 4708)
#             slot = 1 PCI:  if PCI_AD17 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#             slot = 2 PCI:  if PCI_AD18 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#             slot = 3 PCI:  if PCI_AD19 connected to IDSEL pin of the WOMBO chip
#          <param> is the parameter assignment. i.e. "boardflags=0x0000A248"

# Due to the increasing number of NVRAM parameters being added with new wireless chips, sometimes the NVRAM will grow too
# large and not fit in the 4K allocated to it in the CFE image. In order to compress the NVRAM somewhat, the
# "devpathX=<prefix>" notation can be used.
#
# In this notation the "<prefix>" value is the usual prefix as decribed above, like "pci/1/1/".
# The "X" in "devpathX" is a unique number from 0-9. Multiple "devpaths" are supported per NVRAM file. This will be
# needed when a board has multiple wireless chips/interfaces. Suggest to start "X" from 0, and count up.
#
# Then for each prefixed NVRAM parameter, the "X:" part is replaced by <prefix> in the NVRAM parser. This saves space by
# reducing the prefix length from about eight characters ("pci/1/1/") down to two ("1:").
#
# Example:
#   Instead of
#     pci/2/1/boardflags=0x80001200
#     pci/2/1/boardflags2=0x00100000
#
#   Use the "devpath" notation:
#     devpath1=pci/2/1/
#     1:boardflags=0x80001200
#     1:boardflags2=0x00100000

# Power detector offsets. These parameters are used to offset the measured RF power in 40MHz and 80MHz channels.
# This is needed for some RF front end designs that have a shift in measured power for wider bandwidth channels.
# 20MHz channels are assumed to have zero offset as the PA parameters are usually computed using 20MHz channels.

# pdoffset40ma0, pdoffset40ma1, and pdoffset40ma2 are the offsets for 5GHz, 40MHz channels, for chains 0-2.
# Each number is a 16-bit wide field that is broken up into four 4-bit offsets, one for each sub-band of 0-3.

# Each offset is stored in twos compliment format. Units are 1/4 dB.
# Ex: 0x0500 = +1.25dB offset for sub-band 2, that is 1.25dB is added to the measured power to get the correct measured power.

# Power-Per-Rate settings:
#
# General notes on these settings:
#   - real_max_power[chain, rate] = max_power[chain] - power_offset[rate]
#
#   - The power offset is in units of 0.5dB.
#       Note: Some offsets are signed offsets. Others are unsigned. Unless explicitly mentioned, offsets should be treated as unsigned.
#
#   - 11n rates mcs8-mcs15, mcs16-mcs23, and mcs24-mcs31 will have the same power-per-rate offsets corresponding to mcs0-mcs7.
#       In other words, the power-per-rate offsets on each chain are irrepsective of the number of streams
#
#   - 11ac rates mcs0-mcs9 will have the same power-per-rate offsets on each chain irrespective of the number of streams
#
#   - mcs32 uses the same power offsets as legacy 40Dup 6 Mbps
