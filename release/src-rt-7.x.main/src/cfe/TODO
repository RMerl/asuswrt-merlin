This file is a quick list of the things that are being considered
for future development in CFE as it matures.

Customers:  I welcome your comments (good and bad).  


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* No user interface

   One way we envision CFE being used is with no user interface whatsoever;
   it will be used to initialize the BCM12500 and launch a program,
   and that's all.  This configuration might be popular in systems
   with many BCM12500s, where the slave BCM12500s do not need 
   console interfaces of their own.
   
* Simple scripts

   CFE needs some simple script mechanism (it could be as simple as a set
   of commands stored in an environment variable), and a way to invoke
   the script on startup.  For example, such a script could configure
   the network interface and start a netboot from that interface.

* Power-on Diagnostics

   Once we have a reasonable set of power-on diagnostics, they
   will be incorporated into the firmware.

* Set/configure serial port baud rate, store rate in flash

* Better "test" commands for tinkering with SOC peripherals


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES IN PROGRESS, NOT COMPLETED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* User's Manual improvements

   The user's manual needs to be improved to fill in the missing
   sections, add additional sections, and convert the style to
   Broadcom's documentation standards.  You'll be able to get
   the latest manuals from DocSafe when this happens.

* USB Host Stack

   The ATX SWARM evaluation board will include a USB interface for
   attaching a USB keyboard.  A simple USB host stack (sufficient for
   operating a keyboard) will be included.

* Some API functions not implemented

   Several of the API functions available via CFE's external API are not
   implemented, or are missing features.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEAS THAT WON'T NECESSARILY BE DONE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Write access to file systems
 
   Write access to file systems is specifically *not* included in CFE for
   simplicity.  

* Direct support for reading boot files via NFS

   This is outside the design goals for CFE, but given enough requests
   it can be done easily.
