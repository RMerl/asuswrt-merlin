This directory contains "PC Console" routines, to enable the
SWARM board to use PC-style devices for its console.  In
particular, it contains the code to use the X86 emulator
to initialize the VGA, and code to map scan codes to
ASCII characters for a PC keyboard.

What is this good for, you ask?  Just for fun, mostly.  Many of
us have had this screwy notion that a SWARM could be used as
a Linux "workstation" if we could get VGA support and USB
keyboards implemented (oh, yeah, and there's this whole
matter of PC console support in Linux, and X, and ...).

Like the USB host stack, this is among the least-supported
portions of CFE.  If you find it useful, great!  If it doesn't
work or build properly, let us know, but we may not get to fixing
it right away.
