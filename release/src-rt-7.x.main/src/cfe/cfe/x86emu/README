This is a simple X86 emulator.  The original source for this
was taken from the XFree86 project.  This code is used to
interpret the X86 instructions in the ROM on the VGA
adapter to initialize the card to text mode.  Once initialized,
this emulator is no longer needed.

** Read the 'LICENSE' file before using this in production code **

The XFree86 license is similar to the BSD license.
