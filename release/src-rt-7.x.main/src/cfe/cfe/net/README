This directory contains the network modules for CFE.  The
following standards are implemented here:

* Ethernet datalink
* ARP
* IP
* UDP
* ICMP
* TFTP
* BOOTP/DHCP
* DNS (for queries only)
* TCP

If anyone really screams for it, I've considered putting a simple
(very simple) TCP stack in here as well, but it doesn't seem worth it.
