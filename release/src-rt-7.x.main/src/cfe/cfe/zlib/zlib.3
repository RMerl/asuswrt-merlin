.TH ZLIB 3 "9 July 1998"
.SH NAME
zlib \- compression/decompression library
.SH SYNOPSIS
[see
.I zlib.h
for full description]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I zlib
library is a general purpose data compression library.
The code is thread safe.
It provides in-memory compression and decompression functions,
including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream interface.
.LP
Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough
(for example if an input file is mmap'ed),
or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.
In the latter case,
the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
(providing more output space) before each call.
.LP
The library also supports reading and writing files in
.I gzip
(.gz) format
with an interface similar to that of stdio.
.LP
The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks
the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never
crash even in case of corrupted input.
.LP
All functions of the compression library are documented in the file
.IR zlib.h.
The distribution source includes examples of use of the library
the files
.I example.c
and
.IR minigzip.c .
