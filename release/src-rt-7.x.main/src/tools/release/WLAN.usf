##
## This is a common config file that is used mainly by modules
## or brand makefiles. The ".usf" suffix stands for "universal
## settings file". The important feature is that this file is
## both legal makefile and shell syntax, and could be parsed as
## a properties file by any language (Perl, Python, Java, ...)
## which understands properties.
##
## Rules: Each line is either an assignment, a comment, or blank.
## Assignments MUST be of the form "foo=bar" (no spaces) and
## comments have a leading "#" character.
##
## It can be included by common templates like WLAN_Common.mk,
## or by brand makefiles, or sourced by build scripts.
