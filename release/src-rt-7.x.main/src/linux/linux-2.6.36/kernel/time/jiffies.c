/* The Jiffies based clocksource is the lowest common

 * the timer interrupt frequency HZ and it suffers
 * inaccuracies caused by missed or lost timer
 * interrupts and the inability for the timer
 * interrupt hardware to accuratly tick at the
 * requested HZ value. It is also not reccomended
 * for "tick-less" systems.

/* Since jiffies uses a simple NSEC_PER_JIFFY multiplier
 * conversion, the .shift value could be zero. However
 * this would make NTP adjustments impossible as they are
 * in units of 1/2^.shift. Thus we use JIFFIES_SHIFT to
 * shift both the nominator and denominator the same
 * amount, and give ntp adjustments in units of 1/2^8
 *
 * The value 8 is somewhat carefully chosen, as anything
 * larger can result in overflows. NSEC_PER_JIFFY grows as
 * HZ shrinks, so values greater than 8 overflow 32bits when
 * HZ=100.
