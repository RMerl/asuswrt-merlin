 * The ring buffer is made up of a list of pages. A separate list of pages is

 *
 * The reader is special. For each per cpu buffer, the reader has its own
 * reader page. When a reader has read the entire reader page, this reader
 * page is swapped with another page in the ring buffer.
 *
 * Now, as long as the writer is off the reader page, the reader can do what

/*
 * Making the ring buffer lockless makes things tricky.
 * Although writes only happen on the CPU that they are on,
 * and they only need to worry about interrupts. Reads can
 * happen on any CPU.
 *
 * The reader page is always off the ring buffer, but when the
 * reader finishes with a page, it needs to swap its page with
 * a new one from the buffer. The reader needs to take from
 * the head (writes go to the tail). But if a writer is in overwrite
 * mode and wraps, it must push the head page forward.
 *
 * Here lies the problem.
 *
 * The reader must be careful to replace only the head page, and
 * not another one. As described at the top of the file in the
 * ASCII art, the reader sets its old page to point to the next
 * page after head. It then sets the page after head to point to
 * the old reader page. But if the writer moves the head page
 * during this operation, the reader could end up with the tail.
 *
 * We use cmpxchg to help prevent this race. We also do something
 * special with the page before head. We set the LSB to 1.
 *
 * When the writer must push the page forward, it will clear the
 * bit that points to the head page, move the head, and then set
 * the bit that points to the new head page.
 *
 * We also don't want an interrupt coming in and moving the head
 * page on another writer. Thus we use the second LSB to catch
 * that too. Thus:
 *
 * head->list->prev->next        bit 1          bit 0
 *                              -------        -------
 * Normal page                     0              0
 * Points to head page             0              1
 * New head page                   1              0
 *
 * Note we can not trust the prev pointer of the head page, because:
 *
 * +----+       +-----+        +-----+
 * |    |------>|  T  |---X--->|  N  |
 * |    |<------|     |        |     |
 * +----+       +-----+        +-----+
 *   ^                           ^ |
 *   |          +-----+          | |
 *   +----------|  R  |----------+ |

 *         R      Reader page
 *         N      Next page
 *
 * (see __rb_reserve_next() to see where this happens)
 *
 *  What the above shows is that the reader just swapped out
 *  the reader page with a page in the buffer, but before it
 *  could make the new header point back to the new page added
 *  it was preempted by a writer. The writer moved forward onto
 *  the new page added by the reader and is about to move forward
 *  again.
 *
 *  You can see, it is legitimate for the previous pointer of
 *  the head (or any page) not to point back to itself. But only
 *  temporarially.
