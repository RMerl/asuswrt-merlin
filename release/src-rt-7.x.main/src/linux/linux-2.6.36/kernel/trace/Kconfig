	help
	  Enable the kernel to trace every kernel function. This is done
	  by using a compiler feature to insert a small, 5-byte No-Operation
	  instruction at the beginning of every kernel function, which NOP
	  sequence is then dynamically patched into a tracer call when
	  tracing is enabled by the administrator. If it's runtime disabled
	  (the bootup default), then the overhead of the instructions is very

	  Enable the kernel to trace a function at both its return
	  and its entry.
	  Its first purpose is to trace the duration of functions and
	  draw a call graph for each thread with some information like
	  the return value. This is done by setting the current return

	  via:

choice
	prompt "Branch Profiling"
	default BRANCH_PROFILE_NONE
	help
	 The branch profiling is a software profiler. It will add hooks
	 into the C conditionals to test which path a branch takes.

	 The likely/unlikely profiler only looks at the conditions that
	 are annotated with a likely or unlikely macro.

	 The "all branch" profiler will profile every if-statement in the
	 kernel. This profiler will also enable the likely/unlikely
	 profiler.

	 Either of the above profilers adds a bit of overhead to the system.
	 If unsure, choose "No branch profiling".

config BRANCH_PROFILE_NONE
	bool "No branch profiling"
	help
	  No branch profiling. Branch profiling adds a bit of overhead.
	  Only enable it if you want to analyse the branching behavior.
	  Otherwise keep it disabled.

config PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES
	bool "Trace likely/unlikely profiler"
	select TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING
	help
	  This tracer profiles all the the likely and unlikely macros
	  in the kernel. It will display the results in:

	  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/profile_annotated_branch

	  Note: this will add a significant overhead; only turn this
	  on if you need to profile the system's use of these macros.

config PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES
	bool "Profile all if conditionals"
	select TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING
	help
	  This tracer profiles all branch conditions. Every if ()
	  taken in the kernel is recorded whether it hit or miss.
	  The results will be displayed in:

	  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/profile_branch

	  This option also enables the likely/unlikely profiler.

	  This configuration, when enabled, will impose a great overhead
	  on the system. This should only be enabled when the system
	  is to be analyzed in much detail.
endchoice

config TRACING_BRANCHES
	bool
	help
	  Selected by tracers that will trace the likely and unlikely
	  conditions. This prevents the tracers themselves from being
	  profiled. Profiling the tracing infrastructure can only happen
	  when the likelys and unlikelys are not being traced.

config BRANCH_TRACER
	bool "Trace likely/unlikely instances"
	depends on TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING
	select TRACING_BRANCHES
	help
	  This traces the events of likely and unlikely condition
	  calls in the kernel.  The difference between this and the
	  "Trace likely/unlikely profiler" is that this is not a
	  histogram of the callers, but actually places the calling
	  events into a running trace buffer to see when and where the
	  events happened, as well as their results.

	  Say N if unsure.

config STACK_TRACER
	bool "Trace max stack"
	depends on HAVE_FUNCTION_TRACER
	select FUNCTION_TRACER
	select STACKTRACE
	select KALLSYMS
	help
	  This special tracer records the maximum stack footprint of the
	  kernel and displays it in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/stack_trace.

	  This tracer works by hooking into every function call that the
	  kernel executes, and keeping a maximum stack depth value and
	  stack-trace saved.  If this is configured with DYNAMIC_FTRACE
	  then it will not have any overhead while the stack tracer
	  is disabled.

	  To enable the stack tracer on bootup, pass in 'stacktrace'
	  on the kernel command line.

	  The stack tracer can also be enabled or disabled via the
	  sysctl kernel.stack_tracer_enabled

	  Say N if unsure.

config BLK_DEV_IO_TRACE

	depends on SYSFS
	depends on BLOCK
	select RELAY
	select DEBUG_FS
	select TRACEPOINTS
	select GENERIC_TRACER
	select STACKTRACE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to trace the block layer actions
	  on a given queue. Tracing allows you to see any traffic happening
	  on a block device queue. For more information (and the userspace
	  support tools needed), fetch the blktrace tools from:

	  git://git.kernel.dk/blktrace.git

	  Tracing also is possible using the ftrace interface, e.g.:

	    echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/sda1/trace/enable
	    echo blk > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
	    cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe

	  If unsure, say N.

config KPROBE_EVENT
	depends on KPROBES
	depends on HAVE_REGS_AND_STACK_ACCESS_API
	bool "Enable kprobes-based dynamic events"
	select TRACING
	default y
	help
	  This allows the user to add tracing events (similar to tracepoints)
	  on the fly via the ftrace interface. See
	  Documentation/trace/kprobetrace.txt for more details.

	  Those events can be inserted wherever kprobes can probe, and record
	  various register and memory values.

	  This option is also required by perf-probe subcommand of perf tools.
	  If you want to use perf tools, this option is strongly recommended.

config DYNAMIC_FTRACE
	bool "enable/disable ftrace tracepoints dynamically"
	depends on FUNCTION_TRACER
	depends on HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
	default y
	help
          This option will modify all the calls to ftrace dynamically
	  (will patch them out of the binary image and replace them
	  with a No-Op instruction) as they are called. A table is
	  created to dynamically enable them again.

	  This way a CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER kernel is slightly larger, but
	  otherwise has native performance as long as no tracing is active.

	  The changes to the code are done by a kernel thread that
	  wakes up once a second and checks to see if any ftrace calls
	  were made. If so, it runs stop_machine (stops all CPUS)
	  and modifies the code to jump over the call to ftrace.

config FUNCTION_PROFILER
	bool "Kernel function profiler"
	depends on FUNCTION_TRACER
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the kernel function profiler. A file is created
	  in debugfs called function_profile_enabled which defaults to zero.
	  When a 1 is echoed into this file profiling begins, and when a
	  zero is entered, profiling stops. A "functions" file is created in
	  the trace_stats directory; this file shows the list of functions that
	  have been hit and their counters.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config FTRACE_STARTUP_TEST
	bool "Perform a startup test on ftrace"
	depends on GENERIC_TRACER
	select FTRACE_SELFTEST
	help
	  This option performs a series of startup tests on ftrace. On bootup
	  a series of tests are made to verify that the tracer is
	  functioning properly. It will do tests on all the configured
	  tracers of ftrace.

config EVENT_TRACE_TEST_SYSCALLS
	bool "Run selftest on syscall events"
	depends on FTRACE_STARTUP_TEST
	help
	 This option will also enable testing every syscall event.
	 It only enables the event and disables it and runs various loads
	 with the event enabled. This adds a bit more time for kernel boot
	 up since it runs this on every system call defined.

	 TBD - enable a way to actually call the syscalls as we test their
	       events

config MMIOTRACE
	bool "Memory mapped IO tracing"
	depends on HAVE_MMIOTRACE_SUPPORT && PCI
	select GENERIC_TRACER
	help
	  Mmiotrace traces Memory Mapped I/O access and is meant for
	  debugging and reverse engineering. It is called from the ioremap
	  implementation and works via page faults. Tracing is disabled by
	  default and can be enabled at run-time.

	  See Documentation/trace/mmiotrace.txt.
	  If you are not helping to develop drivers, say N.

config MMIOTRACE_TEST
	tristate "Test module for mmiotrace"
	depends on MMIOTRACE && m
	help
	  This is a dumb module for testing mmiotrace. It is very dangerous
	  as it will write garbage to IO memory starting at a given address.
	  However, it should be safe to use on e.g. unused portion of VRAM.

	  Say N, unless you absolutely know what you are doing.

config RING_BUFFER_BENCHMARK
	tristate "Ring buffer benchmark stress tester"
	depends on RING_BUFFER
	help
	  This option creates a test to stress the ring buffer and benchmark it.
	  It creates its own ring buffer such that it will not interfere with
	  any other users of the ring buffer (such as ftrace). It then creates
	  a producer and consumer that will run for 10 seconds and sleep for
	  10 seconds. Each interval it will print out the number of events
	  it recorded and give a rough estimate of how long each iteration took.

	  It does not disable interrupts or raise its priority, so it may be
	  affected by processes that are running.

	  If unsure, say N.
