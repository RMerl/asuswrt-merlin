/*
 * lock->owner state tracking:
 *
 * lock->owner holds the task_struct pointer of the owner. Bit 0 and 1
 * are used to keep track of the "owner is pending" and "lock has
 * waiters" state.
 *
 * owner	bit1	bit0
 * NULL		0	0	lock is free (fast acquire possible)
 * NULL		0	1	invalid state
 * NULL		1	0	Transitional State*
 * NULL		1	1	invalid state
 * taskpointer	0	0	lock is held (fast release possible)
 * taskpointer	0	1	task is pending owner
 * taskpointer	1	0	lock is held and has waiters
 * taskpointer	1	1	task is pending owner and lock has more waiters
 *
 * Pending ownership is assigned to the top (highest priority)
 * waiter of the lock, when the lock is released. The thread is woken
 * up and can now take the lock. Until the lock is taken (bit 0
 * cleared) a competing higher priority thread can steal the lock
 * which puts the woken up thread back on the waiters list.
 *
 * The fast atomic compare exchange based acquire and release is only
 * possible when bit 0 and 1 of lock->owner are 0.
 *
 * (*) There's a small time where the owner can be NULL and the
 * "lock has waiters" bit is set.  This can happen when grabbing the lock.
 * To prevent a cmpxchg of the owner releasing the lock, we need to set this
 * bit before looking at the lock, hence the reason this is a transitional
 * state.
