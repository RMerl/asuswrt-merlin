	  FreeVxFS is a file system driver that support the VERITAS VxFS(TM)
	  file system format.  VERITAS VxFS(TM) is the standard file system
	  of SCO UnixWare (and possibly others) and optionally available
	  for Sunsoft Solaris, HP-UX and many other operating systems.
	  Currently only readonly access is supported.

	  NOTE: the file system type as used by mount(1), mount(2) and
	  fstab(5) is 'vxfs' as it describes the file system format, not
	  the actual driver.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called freevxfs.  If unsure, say N.
