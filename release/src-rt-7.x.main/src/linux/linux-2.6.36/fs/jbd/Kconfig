config JBD
	tristate
	help
	  This is a generic journalling layer for block devices.  It is
	  currently used by the ext3 file system, but it could also be
	  used to add journal support to other file systems or block
	  devices such as RAID or LVM.

	  If you are using the ext3 file system, you need to say Y here.
	  If you are not using ext3 then you will probably want to say N.

	  To compile this device as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called jbd.  If you are compiling ext3 into the kernel, you
	  cannot compile this code as a module.

config JBD_DEBUG
	bool "JBD (ext3) debugging support"
	depends on JBD && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  If you are using the ext3 journaled file system (or potentially any
	  other file system/device using JBD), this option allows you to
	  enable debugging output while the system is running, in order to
	  help track down any problems you are having.  By default the
	  debugging output will be turned off.

	  If you select Y here, then you will be able to turn on debugging
	  with "echo N > /sys/kernel/debug/jbd/jbd-debug", where N is a
	  number between 1 and 5, the higher the number, the more debugging
	  output is generated.  To turn debugging off again, do
	  "echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/jbd/jbd-debug".
