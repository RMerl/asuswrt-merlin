	Return value is BEFS_OK if the blockrun is found, BEFS_ERR

	Algorithm:
	The block runs in the double-indirect region are different.
	They are always allocated 4 fs blocks at a time, so each
	block run maps a constant amount of file data. This means
	that we can directly calculate how many block runs into the
	double-indirect region we need to go to get to the one that
	maps a particular filesystem block.
	
	We do this in two stages. First we calculate which of the
	inode addresses in the double-indirect block will point us
	to the indirect block that contains the mapping for the data,
	then we calculate which of the inode addresses in that 
	indirect block maps the data block we are after.
	
	Oh, and once we've done that, we actually read in the blocks 
	that contain the inode addresses we calculated above. Even 
	though the double-indirect run may be several blocks long, 
	we can calculate which of those blocks will contain the index
	we are after and only read that one. We then follow it to 
	the indirect block and perform a  similar process to find
	the actual block run that maps the data block we are interested
	in.
	
	Then we offset the run as in befs_find_brun_array() and we are 
	done.
