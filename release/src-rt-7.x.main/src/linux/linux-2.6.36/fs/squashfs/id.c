 * For space efficiency regular files store uid and gid indexes, which are
 * converted to 32-bit uids/gids using an id look up table.  This table is
 * stored compressed into metadata blocks.  A second index table is used to
 * locate these.  This second index table for speed of access (and because it
 * is small) is read at mount time and cached in memory.
