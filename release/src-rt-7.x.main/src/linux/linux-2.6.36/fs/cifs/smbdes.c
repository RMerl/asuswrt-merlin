/* NOTES:

   This code makes no attempt to be fast! In fact, it is a very
   slow implementation

   This code is NOT a complete DES implementation. It implements only
   the minimum necessary for SMB authentication, as used by all SMB
   products (including every copy of Microsoft Windows95 ever sold)

   In particular, it can only do a unchained forward DES pass. This
   means it is not possible to use this code for encryption/decryption
   of data, instead it is only useful as a "hash" algorithm.

   There is no entry point into this code that allows normal DES operation.

   I believe this means that this code does not come under ITAR
   regulations but this is NOT a legal opinion. If you are concerned
   about the applicability of ITAR regulations to this code then you
   should confirm it for yourself (and maybe let me know if you come
   up with a different answer to the one above)
