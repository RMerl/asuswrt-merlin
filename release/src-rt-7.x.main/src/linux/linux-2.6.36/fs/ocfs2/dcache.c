 * in the cluster lock won't work due to size restrictions. Covering

 * The dir semaphore will protect us from having to worry about
 * concurrent processes on our node trying to attach a lock at the
 * same time.
 *
 * The dir cluster lock (held at either PR or EX mode) protects us
 * from unlink and rename on other nodes.
 *
 * A dput() can happen asynchronously due to pruning, so we cover
 * attaching and detaching the dentry lock with a
 * dentry_attach_lock.
 *
 * A node which has done lookup on a name retains a protected read
 * lock until final dput. If the user requests and unlink or rename,
 * the protected read is upgraded to an exclusive lock. Other nodes
 * who have seen the dentry will then be informed that they need to
 * downgrade their lock, which will involve d_delete on the
 * dentry. This happens in ocfs2_dentry_convert_worker().
