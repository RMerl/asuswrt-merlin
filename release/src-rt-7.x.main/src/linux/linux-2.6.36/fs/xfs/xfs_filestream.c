 * Allocation group filestream associations are tracked with per-ag atomic
 * counters.  These counters allow _xfs_filestream_pick_ag() to tell whether a
 * particular AG already has active filestreams associated with it. The mount
 * point's m_peraglock is used to protect these counters from per-ag array
 * re-allocation during a growfs operation.  When xfs_growfs_data_private() is
 * about to reallocate the array, it calls xfs_filestream_flush() with the
 * m_peraglock held in write mode.
 *
 * Since xfs_mru_cache_flush() guarantees that all the free functions for all
 * the cache elements have finished executing before it returns, it's safe for
 * the free functions to use the atomic counters without m_peraglock protection.
 * This allows the implementation of xfs_fstrm_free_func() to be agnostic about
 * whether it was called with the m_peraglock held in read mode, write mode or
 * not held at all.  The race condition this addresses is the following:
 *
 *  - The work queue scheduler fires and pulls a filestream directory cache
 *    element off the LRU end of the cache for deletion, then gets pre-empted.
 *  - A growfs operation grabs the m_peraglock in write mode, flushes all the
 *    remaining items from the cache and reallocates the mount point's per-ag
 *    array, resetting all the counters to zero.
 *  - The work queue thread resumes and calls the free function for the element
 *    it started cleaning up earlier.  In the process it decrements the
 *    filestreams counter for an AG that now has no references.
 *
 * With a shrinkfs feature, the above scenario could panic the system.
 *
 * All other uses of the following macros should be protected by either the
 * m_peraglock held in read mode, or the cache's internal locking exposed by the
 * interval between a call to xfs_mru_cache_lookup() and a call to
 * xfs_mru_cache_done().  In addition, the m_peraglock must be held in read mode
 * when new elements are added to the cache.
 *
 * Combined, these locking rules ensure that no associations will ever exist in
 * the cache that reference per-ag array elements that have since been
 * reallocated.
