config SMB_FS

	select NLS
	help
	  SMB (Server Message Block) is the protocol Windows for Workgroups
	  (WfW), Windows 95/98, Windows NT and OS/2 Lan Manager use to share
	  files and printers over local networks.  Saying Y here allows you to
	  mount their file systems (often called "shares" in this context) and
	  access them just like any other Unix directory.  Currently, this
	  works only if the Windows machines use TCP/IP as the underlying
	  transport protocol, and not NetBEUI.  For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt> and the SMB-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note: if you just want your box to act as an SMB *server* and make
	  files and printing services available to Windows clients (which need
	  to have a TCP/IP stack), you don't need to say Y here; you can use
	  the program SAMBA (available from <ftp://ftp.samba.org/pub/samba/>)
	  for that.

	  General information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and
	  Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/linux_mac_win.html>.

	  To compile the SMB support as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called smbfs.  Most people say N, however.

config SMB_NLS_DEFAULT
	bool "Use a default NLS"
	depends on SMB_FS
	help
	  Enabling this will make smbfs use nls translations by default. You
	  need to specify the local charset (CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT) in the nls
	  settings and you need to give the default nls for the SMB server as
	  CONFIG_SMB_NLS_REMOTE.

	  The nls settings can be changed at mount time, if your smbmount
	  supports that, using the codepage and iocharset parameters.

	  smbmount from samba 2.2.0 or later supports this.

config SMB_NLS_REMOTE
	string "Default Remote NLS Option"
	depends on SMB_NLS_DEFAULT
	default "cp437"
	help
	  This setting allows you to specify a default value for which
	  codepage the server uses. If this field is left blank no
	  translations will be done by default. The local codepage/charset
	  default to CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT.

	  The nls settings can be changed at mount time, if your smbmount
	  supports that, using the codepage and iocharset parameters.

	  smbmount from samba 2.2.0 or later supports this.
