** We pack the tails of files on file close, not at the time they are written.
** This implies an unnecessary copy of the tail and an unnecessary indirect item
** insertion/balancing, for files that are written in one write.
** It avoids unnecessary tail packings (balances) for files that are written in
** multiple writes and are small enough to have tails.
**
** file_release is called by the VFS layer when the file is closed.  If
** this is the last open file descriptor, and the file
** small enough to have a tail, and the tail is currently in an
** unformatted node, the tail is converted back into a direct item.
**
** We use reiserfs_truncate_file to pack the tail, since it already has
** all the conditions coded.

   generic_file_write() is only appropriate for filesystems that are not seeking to optimize performance and want
   something simple that works.  It is not for serious use by general purpose filesystems, excepting the one that it was
   written for (ext2/3).  This is for several reasons:

   * It has no understanding of any filesystem specific optimizations.

   * It enters the filesystem repeatedly for each page that is written.

   * It depends on reiserfs_get_block() function which if implemented by reiserfs performs costly search_by_key
   * operation for each page it is supplied with. By contrast reiserfs_file_write() feeds as much as possible at a time
   * to reiserfs which allows for fewer tree traversals.

   * Each indirect pointer insertion takes a lot of cpu, because it involves memory moves inside of blocks.

   * Asking the block allocation code for blocks one at a time is slightly less efficient.

   All of these reasons for not using only generic file write were understood back when reiserfs was first miscoded to
   use it, but we were in a hurry to make code freeze, and so it couldn't be revised then.  This new code should make
   things right finally.

   Future Features: providing search_by_key with hints.
