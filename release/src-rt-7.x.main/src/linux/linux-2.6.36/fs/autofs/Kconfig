	help
	  The automounter is a tool to automatically mount remote file systems
	  on demand. This implementation is partially kernel-based to reduce
	  overhead in the already-mounted case; this is unlike the BSD
	  automounter (amd), which is a pure user space daemon.

	  To use the automounter you need the user-space tools from the autofs
	  package; you can find the location in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
	  You also want to answer Y to "NFS file system support", below.

	  If you want to use the newer version of the automounter with more
	  features, say N here and say Y to "Kernel automounter v4 support",
	  below.

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called autofs.

	  If you are not a part of a fairly large, distributed network, you
	  probably do not need an automounter, and can say N here.
