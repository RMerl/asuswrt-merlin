/* plan9 semantics are that created files are implicitly opened.
 * But linux semantics are that you call create, then open.
 * the plan9 approach is superior as it provides an atomic
 * open.
 * we track the create fid here. When the file is opened, if fidopen is
 * non-zero, we use the fid and can skip some steps.
 * there may be a better way to do this, but I don't know it.
 * one BAD way is to clunk the fid on create, then open it again:
 * you lose the atomicity of file open
 */

/* special case:
 * unlink calls remove, which is an implicit clunk. So we have to track
 * that kind of thing so that we don't try to clunk a dead fid.
