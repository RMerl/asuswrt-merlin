	help
	  With FUSE it is possible to implement a fully functional filesystem
	  in a userspace program.

	  There's also companion library: libfuse.  This library along with
	  utilities is available from the FUSE homepage:
	  <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/>

	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt> for more information.
	  See <file:Documentation/Changes> for needed library/utility version.

	  If you want to develop a userspace FS, or if you want to use
	  a filesystem based on FUSE, answer Y or M.
