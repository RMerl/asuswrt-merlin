	  Flash filesystem aimed to scale efficiently to large devices.
	  In comparison to JFFS2 it offers significantly faster mount
	  times and potentially less RAM usage, although the latter has
	  not been measured yet.

	  In its current state it is still very experimental and should
	  not be used for other than testing purposes.

	  If unsure, say N.
