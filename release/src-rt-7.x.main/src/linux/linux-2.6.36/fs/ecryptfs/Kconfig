	  Encrypted filesystem that operates on the VFS layer.  See
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/ecryptfs.txt> to learn more about
	  eCryptfs.  Userspace components are required and can be
	  obtained from <http://ecryptfs.sf.net>.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ecryptfs.
