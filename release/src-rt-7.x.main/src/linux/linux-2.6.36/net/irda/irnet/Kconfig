	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrNET protocol.
	  To compile it as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called irnet.  IrNET is a PPP driver, so you will also need a
	  working PPP subsystem (driver, daemon and config)...

	  IrNET is an alternate way to transfer TCP/IP traffic over IrDA.  It
	  uses synchronous PPP over a set of point to point IrDA sockets.  You
	  can use it between Linux machine or with W2k.
