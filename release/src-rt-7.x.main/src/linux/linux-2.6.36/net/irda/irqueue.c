/*
 * NOTE :
 * There are various problems with this package :
 *	o the hash function for ints is pathetic (but could be changed)
 *	o locking is sometime suspicious (especially during enumeration)
 *	o most users have only a few elements (== overhead)
 *	o most users never use seach, so don't benefit from hashing
 * Problem already fixed :
 *	o not 64 bit compliant (most users do hashv = (int) self)
 *	o hashbin_remove() is broken => use hashbin_remove_this()
 * I think most users would be better served by a simple linked list
 * (like include/linux/list.h) with a global spinlock per list.

/*
 * Notes on the concurrent access to hashbin and other SMP issues
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 *	Hashbins are very often in the IrDA stack a global repository of
 * information, and therefore used in a very asynchronous manner following
 * various events (driver calls, timers, user calls...).
 *	Therefore, very often it is highly important to consider the
 * management of concurrent access to the hashbin and how to guarantee the
 * consistency of the operations on it.
 *
 *	First, we need to define the objective of locking :
 *		1) Protect user data (content pointed by the hashbin)
 *		2) Protect hashbin structure itself (linked list in each bin)
 *
 *			     OLD LOCKING
 *			     -----------
 *
 *	The previous locking strategy, either HB_LOCAL or HB_GLOBAL were
 * both inadequate in *both* aspect.
 *		o HB_GLOBAL was using a spinlock for each bin (local locking).
 *		o HB_LOCAL was disabling irq on *all* CPUs, so use a single
 *		  global semaphore.
 *	The problems were :
 *		A) Global irq disabling is no longer supported by the kernel
 *		B) No protection for the hashbin struct global data
 *			o hashbin_delete()
 *			o hb_current
 *		C) No protection for user data in some cases
 *
 *	A) HB_LOCAL use global irq disabling, so doesn't work on kernel
 * 2.5.X. Even when it is supported (kernel 2.4.X and earlier), its
 * performance is not satisfactory on SMP setups. Most hashbins were
 * HB_LOCAL, so (A) definitely need fixing.
 *	B) HB_LOCAL could be modified to fix (B). However, because HB_GLOBAL
 * lock only the individual bins, it will never be able to lock the
 * global data, so can't do (B).
 *	C) Some functions return pointer to data that is still in the
 * hashbin :
 *		o hashbin_find()
 *		o hashbin_get_first()
 *		o hashbin_get_next()
 *	As the data is still in the hashbin, it may be changed or free'd
 * while the caller is examinimg the data. In those case, locking can't
 * be done within the hashbin, but must include use of the data within
 * the caller.
 *	The caller can easily do this with HB_LOCAL (just disable irqs).
 * However, this is impossible with HB_GLOBAL because the caller has no
 * way to know the proper bin, so don't know which spinlock to use.
 *
 *	Quick summary : can no longer use HB_LOCAL, and HB_GLOBAL is
 * fundamentally broken and will never work.
 *
 *			     NEW LOCKING
 *			     -----------
 *
 *	To fix those problems, I've introduce a few changes in the
 * hashbin locking :
 *		1) New HB_LOCK scheme
 *		2) hashbin->hb_spinlock
 *		3) New hashbin usage policy
 *
 * HB_LOCK :
 * -------
 *	HB_LOCK is a locking scheme intermediate between the old HB_LOCAL
 * and HB_GLOBAL. It uses a single spinlock to protect the whole content
 * of the hashbin. As it is a single spinlock, it can protect the global
 * data of the hashbin and not only the bins themselves.
 *	HB_LOCK can only protect some of the hashbin calls, so it only lock
 * call that can be made 100% safe and leave other call unprotected.
 *	HB_LOCK in theory is slower than HB_GLOBAL, but as the hashbin
 * content is always small contention is not high, so it doesn't matter
 * much. HB_LOCK is probably faster than HB_LOCAL.
 *
 * hashbin->hb_spinlock :
 * --------------------
 *	The spinlock that HB_LOCK uses is available for caller, so that
 * the caller can protect unprotected calls (see below).
 *	If the caller want to do entirely its own locking (HB_NOLOCK), he
 * can do so and may use safely this spinlock.
 *	Locking is done like this :
 *		spin_lock_irqsave(&hashbin->hb_spinlock, flags);
 *	Releasing the lock :
 *		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&hashbin->hb_spinlock, flags);
 *
 * Safe & Protected calls :
 * ----------------------
 *	The following calls are safe or protected via HB_LOCK :
 *		o hashbin_new()		-> safe
 *		o hashbin_delete()
 *		o hashbin_insert()
 *		o hashbin_remove_first()
 *		o hashbin_remove()
 *		o hashbin_remove_this()
 *		o HASHBIN_GET_SIZE()	-> atomic
 *
 *	The following calls only protect the hashbin itself :
 *		o hashbin_lock_find()
 *		o hashbin_find_next()
 *
 * Unprotected calls :
 * -----------------
 *	The following calls need to be protected by the caller :
 *		o hashbin_find()
 *		o hashbin_get_first()
 *		o hashbin_get_next()
 *
 * Locking Policy :
 * --------------
 *	If the hashbin is used only in a single thread of execution
 * (explicitly or implicitely), you can use HB_NOLOCK
 *	If the calling module already provide concurrent access protection,
 * you may use HB_NOLOCK.
 *
 *	In all other cases, you need to use HB_LOCK and lock the hashbin
 * every time before calling one of the unprotected calls. You also must
 * use the pointer returned by the unprotected call within the locked
 * region.
 *
 * Extra care for enumeration :
 * --------------------------
 *	hashbin_get_first() and hashbin_get_next() use the hashbin to
 * store the current position, in hb_current.
 *	As long as the hashbin remains locked, this is safe. If you unlock
 * the hashbin, the current position may change if anybody else modify
 * or enumerate the hashbin.
 *	Summary : do the full enumeration while locked.
 *
 *	Alternatively, you may use hashbin_find_next(). But, this will
 * be slower, is more complex to use and doesn't protect the hashbin
 * content. So, care is needed here as well.
 *
 * Other issues :
 * ------------
 *	I believe that we are overdoing it by using spin_lock_irqsave()
 * and we should use only spin_lock_bh() or similar. But, I don't have
 * the balls to try it out.
 *	Don't believe that because hashbin are now (somewhat) SMP safe
 * that the rest of the code is. Higher layers tend to be safest,
 * but LAP and LMP would need some serious dedicated love.
 *
