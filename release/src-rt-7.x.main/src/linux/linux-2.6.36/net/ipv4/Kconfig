config IP_MULTICAST
	bool "IP: multicasting"
	help
	  This is code for addressing several networked computers at once,
	  enlarging your kernel by about 2 KB. You need multicasting if you
	  intend to participate in the MBONE, a high bandwidth network on top
	  of the Internet which carries audio and video broadcasts. More
	  information about the MBONE is on the WWW at
	  <http://www.savetz.com/mbone/>. Information about the multicast
	  capabilities of the various network cards is contained in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/multicast.txt>. For most people, it's
	  safe to say N.

config IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER
	bool "IP: advanced router"
	---help---
	  If you intend to run your Linux box mostly as a router, i.e. as a
	  computer that forwards and redistributes network packets, say Y; you
	  will then be presented with several options that allow more precise
	  control about the routing process.

	  The answer to this question won't directly affect the kernel:
	  answering N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
	  questions about advanced routing.

	  Note that your box can only act as a router if you enable IP
	  forwarding in your kernel; you can do that by saying Y to "/proc
	  file system support" and "Sysctl support" below and executing the
	  line

	  echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

	  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

	  If you turn on IP forwarding, you should consider the rp_filter, which
	  automatically rejects incoming packets if the routing table entry
	  for their source address doesn't match the network interface they're
	  arriving on. This has security advantages because it prevents the
	  so-called IP spoofing, however it can pose problems if you use
	  asymmetric routing (packets from you to a host take a different path
	  than packets from that host to you) or if you operate a non-routing
	  host which has several IP addresses on different interfaces. To turn
	  rp_filter on use:

	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<device>/rp_filter
	   or
	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter

	  Note that some distributions enable it in startup scripts.
	  For details about rp_filter strict and loose mode read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt>.

	  If unsure, say N here.

	  Normally, a router decides what to do with a received packet based
	  solely on the packet's final destination address. If you say Y here,
	  the Linux router will also be able to take the packet's source
	  address into account. Furthermore, the TOS (Type-Of-Service) field
	  of the packet can be used for routing decisions as well.

config IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH

	  Normally, the routing tables specify a single action to be taken in
	  a deterministic manner for a given packet. If you say Y here
	  however, it becomes possible to attach several actions to a packet
	  pattern, in effect specifying several alternative paths to travel
	  for those packets. The router considers all these paths to be of
	  equal "cost" and chooses one of them in a non-deterministic fashion
	  if a matching packet arrives.

config IP_ROUTE_VERBOSE
	bool "IP: verbose route monitoring"
	depends on IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER

	  If you say Y here, which is recommended, then the kernel will print

	---help---
	  Tunneling means encapsulating data of one protocol type within
	  another protocol and sending it over a channel that understands the
	  encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements
	  encapsulation of IP within IP, which sounds kind of pointless, but
	  can be useful if you want to make your (or some other) machine
	  appear on a different network than it physically is, or to use
	  mobile-IP facilities (allowing laptops to seamlessly move between
	  networks without changing their IP addresses).

	  Saying Y to this option will produce two modules ( = code which can

	  Tunneling means encapsulating data of one protocol type within

	  encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements
	  GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) and at this time allows
	  encapsulating of IPv4 or IPv6 over existing IPv4 infrastructure.
	  This driver is useful if the other endpoint is a Cisco router: Cisco
	  likes GRE much better than the other Linux tunneling driver ("IP
	  tunneling" above). In addition, GRE allows multicast redistribution
	  through the tunnel.

config NET_IPGRE_BROADCAST

	  One application of GRE/IP is to construct a broadcast WAN (Wide Area

config IP_MROUTE
	bool "IP: multicast routing"
	depends on IP_MULTICAST
	help
	  This is used if you want your machine to act as a router for IP

	  likely run the program mrouted. Information about the multicast

config IP_MROUTE_MULTIPLE_TABLES

	  Normally, a multicast router runs a userspace daemon and decides

	  account and run multiple instances of userspace daemons

	  because Cisco supports it. You need special software to use it
	  (pimd-v1). Please see <http://netweb.usc.edu/pim/> for more
	  information about PIM.

	  Say Y if you want to use PIM-SM v1. Note that you can say N here if
	  you just want to use Dense Mode PIM.

config IP_PIMSM_V2
	bool "IP: PIM-SM version 2 support"
	depends on IP_MROUTE
	help
	  Kernel side support for Sparse Mode PIM version 2. In order to use
	  this, you need an experimental routing daemon supporting it (pimd or
	  gated-5). This routing protocol is not used widely, so say N unless
	  you want to play with it.

config ARPD
	bool "IP: ARP daemon support"
	---help---
	  The kernel maintains an internal cache which maps IP addresses to
	  hardware addresses on the local network, so that Ethernet/Token Ring/
	  etc. frames are sent to the proper address on the physical networking
	  layer. Normally, kernel uses the ARP protocol to resolve these
	  mappings.

	  Saying Y here adds support to have an user space daemon to do this
	  resolution instead. This is useful for implementing an alternate
	  address resolution protocol (e.g. NHRP on mGRE tunnels) and also for
	  testing purposes.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SYN_COOKIES
	bool "IP: TCP syncookie support"
	---help---
	  Normal TCP/IP networking is open to an attack known as "SYN
	  flooding". This denial-of-service attack prevents legitimate remote
	  users from being able to connect to your computer during an ongoing
	  attack and requires very little work from the attacker, who can
	  operate from anywhere on the Internet.

	  SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you
	  say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge
	  protocol known as "SYN cookies" to enable legitimate users to
	  continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There
	  is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software;
	  SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information
	  about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.

	  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is
	  likely to have been forged by the attacker; it is only reported as
	  an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not
	  be taken as absolute truth.

	  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the
	  server is really overloaded. If this happens frequently better turn
	  them off.

	  If you say Y here, you can disable SYN cookies at run time by
	  saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies

	  after the /proc file system has been mounted.
