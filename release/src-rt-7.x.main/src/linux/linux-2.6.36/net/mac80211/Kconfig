	 This options enables support of Draft 802.11s mesh networking.
	 The implementation is based on Draft 2.08 of the Mesh Networking
	 amendment.  However, no compliance with that draft is claimed or even
	 possible, as drafts leave a number of identifiers to be defined after
	 ratification.  For more information visit http://o11s.org/.

	  easier debugging of problems in the transmit and receive
	  paths.

	  This option increases code size a bit and inserts a lot
	  of function calls in the code, but is otherwise safe to
