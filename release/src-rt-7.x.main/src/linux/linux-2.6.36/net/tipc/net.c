/*
 * The TIPC locking policy is designed to ensure a very fine locking
 * granularity, permitting complete parallel access to individual
 * port and node/link instances. The code consists of three major
 * locking domains, each protected with their own disjunct set of locks.
 *
 * 1: The routing hierarchy.
 *    Comprises the structures 'zone', 'cluster', 'node', 'link'
 *    and 'bearer'. The whole hierarchy is protected by a big
 *    read/write lock, tipc_net_lock, to enssure that nothing is added
 *    or removed while code is accessing any of these structures.
 *    This layer must not be called from the two others while they
 *    hold any of their own locks.
 *    Neither must it itself do any upcalls to the other two before
 *    it has released tipc_net_lock and other protective locks.
 *
 *   Within the tipc_net_lock domain there are two sub-domains;'node' and
 *   'bearer', where local write operations are permitted,
 *   provided that those are protected by individual spin_locks
 *   per instance. Code holding tipc_net_lock(read) and a node spin_lock
 *   is permitted to poke around in both the node itself and its
 *   subordinate links. I.e, it can update link counters and queues,
 *   change link state, send protocol messages, and alter the
 *   "active_links" array in the node; but it can _not_ remove a link
 *   or a node from the overall structure.
 *   Correspondingly, individual bearers may change status within a
 *   tipc_net_lock(read), protected by an individual spin_lock ber bearer
 *   instance, but it needs tipc_net_lock(write) to remove/add any bearers.
 *
 *
 *  2: The transport level of the protocol.
 *     This consists of the structures port, (and its user level
 *     representations, such as user_port and tipc_sock), reference and
 *     tipc_user (port.c, reg.c, socket.c).
 *
 *     This layer has four different locks:
 *     - The tipc_port spin_lock. This is protecting each port instance
 *       from parallel data access and removal. Since we can not place
 *       this lock in the port itself, it has been placed in the
 *       corresponding reference table entry, which has the same life
 *       cycle as the module. This entry is difficult to access from
 *       outside the TIPC core, however, so a pointer to the lock has
 *       been added in the port instance, -to be used for unlocking
 *       only.
 *     - A read/write lock to protect the reference table itself (teg.c).
 *       (Nobody is using read-only access to this, so it can just as
 *       well be changed to a spin_lock)
 *     - A spin lock to protect the registry of kernel/driver users (reg.c)
 *     - A global spin_lock (tipc_port_lock), which only task is to ensure
 *       consistency where more than one port is involved in an operation,
 *       i.e., whe a port is part of a linked list of ports.
 *       There are two such lists; 'port_list', which is used for management,
 *       and 'wait_list', which is used to queue ports during congestion.
 *
 *  3: The name table (name_table.c, name_distr.c, subscription.c)
 *     - There is one big read/write-lock (tipc_nametbl_lock) protecting the
 *       overall name table structure. Nothing must be added/removed to
 *       this structure without holding write access to it.
 *     - There is one local spin_lock per sub_sequence, which can be seen
 *       as a sub-domain to the tipc_nametbl_lock domain. It is used only
 *       for translation operations, and is needed because a translation
 *       steps the root of the 'publication' linked list between each lookup.
 *       This is always used within the scope of a tipc_nametbl_lock(read).
 *     - A local spin_lock protecting the queue of subscriber events.
