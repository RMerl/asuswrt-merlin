 * High level machine check handler. Handles pages reported by the
 * hardware as being corrupted usually due to a 2bit ECC memory or cache
 * failure.
 *
 * Handles page cache pages in various states.	The tricky part
 * here is that we can access any page asynchronous to other VM
 * users, because memory failures could happen anytime and anywhere,
 * possibly violating some of their assumptions. This is why this code
 * has to be extremely careful. Generally it tries to use normal locking
 * rules, as in get the standard locks, even if that means the
 * error handling takes potentially a long time.
 *
 * The operation to map back from RMAP chains to processes has to walk
 * the complete process list and has non linear complexity with the number
 * mappings. In short it can be quite slow. But since memory corruptions
 * are rare we hope to get away with this.
