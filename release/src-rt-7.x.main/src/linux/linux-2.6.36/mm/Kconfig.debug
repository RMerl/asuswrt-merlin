	  Unmap pages from the kernel linear mapping after free_pages().

	  of memory corruption.

	   Fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify
	   the patterns before alloc_pages(). This results in a large slowdown,
	   but helps to find certain types of memory corruption.

	   This option cannot be enabled in combination with hibernation as
	   that would result in incorrect warnings of memory corruption after
	   a resume because free pages are not saved to the suspend image.
