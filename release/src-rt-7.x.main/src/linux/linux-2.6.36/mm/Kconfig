	  This option allows you to change some of the ways that
	  Linux manages its memory internally.  Most users will
	  only have one option here: FLATMEM.  This is normal
	  and a correct option.

	  Some users of more advanced features like NUMA and
	  memory hotplug may have different options here.
	  DISCONTIGMEM is an more mature, better tested system,
	  but is incompatible with memory hotplug and may suffer
	  decreased performance over SPARSEMEM.  If unsure between
	  "Sparse Memory" and "Discontiguous Memory", choose
	  "Discontiguous Memory".

	  If unsure, choose this option (Flat Memory) over any other.

config DISCONTIGMEM_MANUAL
	bool "Discontiguous Memory"
	depends on ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE
	help
	  This option provides enhanced support for discontiguous
	  memory systems, over FLATMEM.  These systems have holes
	  in their physical address spaces, and this option provides
	  more efficient handling of these holes.  However, the vast
	  majority of hardware has quite flat address spaces, and
	  can have degraded performance from the extra overhead that
	  this option imposes.

	  Many NUMA configurations will have this as the only option.

	  If unsure, choose "Flat Memory" over this option.

config SPARSEMEM_MANUAL
	bool "Sparse Memory"
	depends on ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE
	help
	  This will be the only option for some systems, including
	  memory hotplug systems.  This is normal.

	  For many other systems, this will be an alternative to
	  "Discontiguous Memory".  This option provides some potential
	  performance benefits, along with decreased code complexity,
	  but it is newer, and more experimental.

	  If unsure, choose "Discontiguous Memory" or "Flat Memory"
	  over this option.

	  This is the portion of low virtual memory which should be protected

	  can help reduce the impact of kernel NULL pointer bugs.

	  For most ia64, ppc64 and x86 users with lots of address space

	help
	  The NOMMU mmap() frequently needs to allocate large contiguous chunks
	  of memory on which to store mappings, but it can only ask the system
	  allocator for chunks in 2^N*PAGE_SIZE amounts - which is frequently
	  more than it requires.  To deal with this, mmap() is able to trim off
	  the excess and return it to the allocator.

	  If trimming is enabled, the excess is trimmed off and returned to the
	  system allocator, which can cause extra fragmentation, particularly
	  if there are a lot of transient processes.

	  If trimming is disabled, the excess is kept, but not used, which for
	  long-term mappings means that the space is wasted.

	  Trimming can be dynamically controlled through a sysctl option
	  (/proc/sys/vm/nr_trim_pages) which specifies the minimum number of
	  excess pages there must be before trimming should occur, or zero if
	  no trimming is to occur.

	  This option specifies the initial value of this option.  The default
	  of 1 says that all excess pages should be trimmed.

	  See Documentation/nommu-mmap.txt for more information.
