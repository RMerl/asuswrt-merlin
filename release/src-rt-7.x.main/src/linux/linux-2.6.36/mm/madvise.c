/*
 * The madvise(2) system call.
 *
 * Applications can use madvise() to advise the kernel how it should
 * handle paging I/O in this VM area.  The idea is to help the kernel
 * use appropriate read-ahead and caching techniques.  The information
 * provided is advisory only, and can be safely disregarded by the
 * kernel without affecting the correct operation of the application.
 *
 * behavior values:
 *  MADV_NORMAL - the default behavior is to read clusters.  This
 *		results in some read-ahead and read-behind.
 *  MADV_RANDOM - the system should read the minimum amount of data
 *		on any access, since it is unlikely that the appli-
 *		cation will need more than what it asks for.
 *  MADV_SEQUENTIAL - pages in the given range will probably be accessed
 *		once, so they can be aggressively read ahead, and
 *		can be freed soon after they are accessed.
 *  MADV_WILLNEED - the application is notifying the system to read
 *		some pages ahead.
 *  MADV_DONTNEED - the application is finished with the given range,
 *		so the kernel can free resources associated with it.
 *  MADV_REMOVE - the application wants to free up the given range of
 *		pages and associated backing store.
 *  MADV_DONTFORK - omit this area from child's address space when forking:
 *		typically, to avoid COWing pages pinned by get_user_pages().
 *  MADV_DOFORK - cancel MADV_DONTFORK: no longer omit this area when forking.
 *  MADV_MERGEABLE - the application recommends that KSM try to merge pages in
 *		this area with pages of identical content from other such areas.
 *  MADV_UNMERGEABLE- cancel MADV_MERGEABLE: no longer merge pages with others.
 *
 * return values:
 *  zero    - success
 *  -EINVAL - start + len < 0, start is not page-aligned,
 *		"behavior" is not a valid value, or application
 *		is attempting to release locked or shared pages.
 *  -ENOMEM - addresses in the specified range are not currently
 *		mapped, or are outside the AS of the process.
 *  -EIO    - an I/O error occurred while paging in data.
 *  -EBADF  - map exists, but area maps something that isn't a file.
 *  -EAGAIN - a kernel resource was temporarily unavailable.
