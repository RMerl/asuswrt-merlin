 * two (2) data frames before beeing sent on the "wire", which speed up
 * new socket setup when the link is saturated.
 * Same story for two sockets competing for the medium : if one saturates
 * the LAP, when the other want to transmit it only has to wait for
 * maximum three (3) packets (2 + one scheduling), which improve performance
 * of delay sensitive applications.
