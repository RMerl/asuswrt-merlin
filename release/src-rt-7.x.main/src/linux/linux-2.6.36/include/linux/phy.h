/* PHY state machine states:
 *
 * DOWN: PHY device and driver are not ready for anything.  probe
 * should be called if and only if the PHY is in this state,
 * given that the PHY device exists.
 * - PHY driver probe function will, depending on the PHY, set
 * the state to STARTING or READY
 *
 * STARTING:  PHY device is coming up, and the ethernet driver is
 * not ready.  PHY drivers may set this in the probe function.
 * If they do, they are responsible for making sure the state is
 * eventually set to indicate whether the PHY is UP or READY,
 * depending on the state when the PHY is done starting up.
 * - PHY driver will set the state to READY
 * - start will set the state to PENDING
 *
 * READY: PHY is ready to send and receive packets, but the
 * controller is not.  By default, PHYs which do not implement
 * probe will be set to this state by phy_probe().  If the PHY
 * driver knows the PHY is ready, and the PHY state is STARTING,
 * then it sets this STATE.
 * - start will set the state to UP
 *
 * PENDING: PHY device is coming up, but the ethernet driver is
 * ready.  phy_start will set this state if the PHY state is
 * STARTING.
 * - PHY driver will set the state to UP when the PHY is ready
 *
 * UP: The PHY and attached device are ready to do work.
 * Interrupts should be started here.
 * - timer moves to AN
 *
 * AN: The PHY is currently negotiating the link state.  Link is
 * therefore down for now.  phy_timer will set this state when it
 * detects the state is UP.  config_aneg will set this state
 * whenever called with phydev->autoneg set to AUTONEG_ENABLE.
 * - If autonegotiation finishes, but there's no link, it sets
 *   the state to NOLINK.
 * - If aneg finishes with link, it sets the state to RUNNING,
 *   and calls adjust_link
 * - If autonegotiation did not finish after an arbitrary amount
 *   of time, autonegotiation should be tried again if the PHY
 *   supports "magic" autonegotiation (back to AN)
 * - If it didn't finish, and no magic_aneg, move to FORCING.
 *
 * NOLINK: PHY is up, but not currently plugged in.
 * - If the timer notes that the link comes back, we move to RUNNING
 * - config_aneg moves to AN
 * - phy_stop moves to HALTED
 *
 * FORCING: PHY is being configured with forced settings
 * - if link is up, move to RUNNING
 * - If link is down, we drop to the next highest setting, and
 *   retry (FORCING) after a timeout
 * - phy_stop moves to HALTED
 *
 * RUNNING: PHY is currently up, running, and possibly sending
 * and/or receiving packets
 * - timer will set CHANGELINK if we're polling (this ensures the
 *   link state is polled every other cycle of this state machine,
 *   which makes it every other second)
 * - irq will set CHANGELINK
 * - config_aneg will set AN
 * - phy_stop moves to HALTED
 *
 * CHANGELINK: PHY experienced a change in link state
 * - timer moves to RUNNING if link
 * - timer moves to NOLINK if the link is down
 * - phy_stop moves to HALTED
 *
 * HALTED: PHY is up, but no polling or interrupts are done. Or
 * PHY is in an error state.
 *
 * - phy_start moves to RESUMING
 *
 * RESUMING: PHY was halted, but now wants to run again.
 * - If we are forcing, or aneg is done, timer moves to RUNNING
 * - If aneg is not done, timer moves to AN
 * - phy_stop moves to HALTED
