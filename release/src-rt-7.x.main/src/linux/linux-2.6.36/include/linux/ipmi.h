/*
 * This file describes an interface to an IPMI driver.  You have to
 * have a fairly good understanding of IPMI to use this, so go read
 * the specs first before actually trying to do anything.
 *
 * With that said, this driver provides a multi-user interface to the
 * IPMI driver, and it allows multiple IPMI physical interfaces below
 * the driver.  The physical interfaces bind as a lower layer on the
 * driver.  They appear as interfaces to the application using this
 * interface.
 *
 * Multi-user means that multiple applications may use the driver,
 * send commands, receive responses, etc.  The driver keeps track of
 * commands the user sends and tracks the responses.  The responses
 * will go back to the application that send the command.  If the
 * response doesn't come back in time, the driver will return a
 * timeout error response to the application.  Asynchronous events
 * from the BMC event queue will go to all users bound to the driver.
 * The incoming event queue in the BMC will automatically be flushed
 * if it becomes full and it is queried once a second to see if
 * anything is in it.  Incoming commands to the driver will get
 * delivered as commands.
 *
 * This driver provides two main interfaces: one for in-kernel
 * applications and another for userland applications.  The
 * capabilities are basically the same for both interface, although
 * the interfaces are somewhat different.  The stuff in the
 * #ifdef __KERNEL__ below is the in-kernel interface.  The userland
 * interface is defined later in the file.  */

 * The userland interface
 */

/*
 * The userland interface for the IPMI driver is a standard character
 * device, with each instance of an interface registered as a minor
 * number under the major character device.
 *
 * The read and write calls do not work, to get messages in and out
 * requires ioctl calls because of the complexity of the data.  select
 * and poll do work, so you can wait for input using the file
 * descriptor, you just can use read to get it.
 *
 * In general, you send a command down to the interface and receive
 * responses back.  You can use the msgid value to correlate commands
 * and responses, the driver will take care of figuring out which
 * incoming messages are for which command and find the proper msgid
 * value to report.  You will only receive reponses for commands you
 * send.  Asynchronous events, however, go to all open users, so you
 * must be ready to handle these (or ignore them if you don't care).
 *
 * The address type depends upon the channel type.  When talking
 * directly to the BMC (IPMC_BMC_CHANNEL), the address is ignored
 * (IPMI_UNUSED_ADDR_TYPE).  When talking to an IPMB channel, you must
 * supply a valid IPMB address with the addr_type set properly.
 *
 * When talking to normal channels, the driver takes care of the
 * details of formatting and sending messages on that channel.  You do
 * not, for instance, have to format a send command, you just send
 * whatever command you want to the channel, the driver will create
 * the send command, automatically issue receive command and get even
 * commands, and pass those up to the proper user.
