* @default_brightness: Backlight brightness is initialized to this value

* Brightness to be used after the driver has been probed.
* Valid range 0-63.
*
* @default_brightness_limit: The actual brightness is limited by this value
*
* Brightness limit to be used after the driver has been probed. This is useful
* when it is not known how much power is available for the backlight during
* probe.
* Valid range 0-63. Can be changed later with pcf50633_bl_set_brightness_limit.
*
* @ramp_time: Display ramp time when changing brightness
*
* When changing the backlights brightness the change is not instant, instead
* it fades smooth from one state to another. This value specifies how long
* the fade should take. The lower the value the higher the fade time.
* Valid range 0-255
