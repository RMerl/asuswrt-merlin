/**
 * struct platform_suspend_ops - Callbacks for managing platform dependent
 *	system sleep states.
 *
 * @valid: Callback to determine if given system sleep state is supported by
 *	the platform.
 *	Valid (ie. supported) states are advertised in /sys/power/state.  Note
 *	that it still may be impossible to enter given system sleep state if the
 *	conditions aren't right.
 *	There is the %suspend_valid_only_mem function available that can be
 *	assigned to this if the platform only supports mem sleep.
 *
 * @begin: Initialise a transition to given system sleep state.
 *	@begin() is executed right prior to suspending devices.  The information
 *	conveyed to the platform code by @begin() should be disregarded by it as
 *	soon as @end() is executed.  If @begin() fails (ie. returns nonzero),
 *	@prepare(), @enter() and @finish() will not be called by the PM core.
 *	This callback is optional.  However, if it is implemented, the argument
 *	passed to @enter() is redundant and should be ignored.
 *
 * @prepare: Prepare the platform for entering the system sleep state indicated
 *	by @begin().
 *	@prepare() is called right after devices have been suspended (ie. the
 *	appropriate .suspend() method has been executed for each device) and
 *	before device drivers' late suspend callbacks are executed.  It returns
 *	0 on success or a negative error code otherwise, in which case the
 *	system cannot enter the desired sleep state (@prepare_late(), @enter(),
 *	and @wake() will not be called in that case).
 *
 * @prepare_late: Finish preparing the platform for entering the system sleep
 *	state indicated by @begin().
 *	@prepare_late is called before disabling nonboot CPUs and after
 *	device drivers' late suspend callbacks have been executed.  It returns
 *	0 on success or a negative error code otherwise, in which case the
 *	system cannot enter the desired sleep state (@enter() will not be
 *	executed).
 *
 * @enter: Enter the system sleep state indicated by @begin() or represented by
 *	the argument if @begin() is not implemented.
 *	This callback is mandatory.  It returns 0 on success or a negative
 *	error code otherwise, in which case the system cannot enter the desired
 *	sleep state.
 *
 * @wake: Called when the system has just left a sleep state, right after
 *	the nonboot CPUs have been enabled and before device drivers' early
 *	resume callbacks are executed.
 *	This callback is optional, but should be implemented by the platforms
 *	that implement @prepare_late().  If implemented, it is always called
 *	after @prepare_late and @enter(), even if one of them fails.
 *
 * @finish: Finish wake-up of the platform.
 *	@finish is called right prior to calling device drivers' regular suspend
 *	callbacks.
 *	This callback is optional, but should be implemented by the platforms
 *	that implement @prepare().  If implemented, it is always called after
 *	@enter() and @wake(), even if any of them fails.  It is executed after
 *	a failing @prepare.
 *
 * @end: Called by the PM core right after resuming devices, to indicate to
 *	the platform that the system has returned to the working state or
 *	the transition to the sleep state has been aborted.
 *	This callback is optional, but should be implemented by the platforms
 *	that implement @begin().  Accordingly, platforms implementing @begin()
 *	should also provide a @end() which cleans up transitions aborted before
 *	@enter().
 *
 * @recover: Recover the platform from a suspend failure.
 *	Called by the PM core if the suspending of devices fails.
 *	This callback is optional and should only be implemented by platforms
 *	which require special recovery actions in that situation.

 *
 * @begin: Tell the platform driver that we're starting hibernation.

 * @end: Called by the PM core right after resuming devices, to indicate to
 *	the platform that the system has returned to the working state.
 *
 * @pre_snapshot: Prepare the platform for creating the hibernation image.
 *	Called right after devices have been frozen and before the nonboot
 *	CPUs are disabled (runs with IRQs on).
 *
 * @finish: Restore the previous state of the platform after the hibernation
 *	image has been created *or* put the platform into the normal operation
 *	mode after the hibernation (the same method is executed in both cases).
 *	Called right after the nonboot CPUs have been enabled and before
 *	thawing devices (runs with IRQs on).
 *
 * @prepare: Prepare the platform for entering the low power state.
 *	Called right after the hibernation image has been saved and before
 *	devices are prepared for entering the low power state.
 *
 * @enter: Put the system into the low power state after the hibernation image
 *	has been saved to disk.
 *	Called after the nonboot CPUs have been disabled and all of the low
 *	level devices have been shut down (runs with IRQs off).
 *
 * @leave: Perform the first stage of the cleanup after the system sleep state
 *	indicated by @set_target() has been left.
 *	Called right after the control has been passed from the boot kernel to
 *	the image kernel, before the nonboot CPUs are enabled and before devices
 *	are resumed.  Executed with interrupts disabled.
 *
 * @pre_restore: Prepare system for the restoration from a hibernation image.
 *	Called right after devices have been frozen and before the nonboot
 *	CPUs are disabled (runs with IRQs on).
 *
 * @restore_cleanup: Clean up after a failing image restoration.
 *	Called right after the nonboot CPUs have been enabled and before
 *	thawing devices (runs with IRQs on).
 *
 * @recover: Recover the platform from a failure to suspend devices.
 *	Called by the PM core if the suspending of devices during hibernation
 *	fails.  This callback is optional and should only be implemented by
