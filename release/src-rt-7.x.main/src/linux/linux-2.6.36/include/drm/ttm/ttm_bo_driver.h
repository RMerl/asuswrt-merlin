 * Locks a buffer object for validation. (Or prevents other processes from
 * locking it for validation) and removes it from lru lists, while taking
 * a number of measures to prevent deadlocks.
 *
 * Deadlocks may occur when two processes try to reserve multiple buffers in
 * different order, either by will or as a result of a buffer being evicted
 * to make room for a buffer already reserved. (Buffers are reserved before
 * they are evicted). The following algorithm prevents such deadlocks from
 * occuring:
 * 1) Buffers are reserved with the lru spinlock held. Upon successful
 * reservation they are removed from the lru list. This stops a reserved buffer
 * from being evicted. However the lru spinlock is released between the time
 * a buffer is selected for eviction and the time it is reserved.
 * Therefore a check is made when a buffer is reserved for eviction, that it
 * is still the first buffer in the lru list, before it is removed from the
 * list. @check_lru == 1 forces this check. If it fails, the function returns
 * -EINVAL, and the caller should then choose a new buffer to evict and repeat
 * the procedure.
 * 2) Processes attempting to reserve multiple buffers other than for eviction,
 * (typically execbuf), should first obtain a unique 32-bit
 * validation sequence number,
 * and call this function with @use_sequence == 1 and @sequence == the unique
 * sequence number. If upon call of this function, the buffer object is already
 * reserved, the validation sequence is checked against the validation
 * sequence of the process currently reserving the buffer,
