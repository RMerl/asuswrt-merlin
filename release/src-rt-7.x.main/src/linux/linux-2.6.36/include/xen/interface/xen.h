	 *     prevent unbounded stack usage. Whatever the purpose, we expect
	 *     that the mask will be asserted only for short periods at a time,
	 *     and so the likelihood of a 'spurious' IPI is suitably small.
	 * The mask is read before making an event upcall to the guest: a
	 * non-zero mask therefore guarantees that the VCPU will not receive
	 * an upcall activation. The mask is cleared when the VCPU requests
	 * to block: this avoids wakeup-waiting races.

	 *     arrange out-of-band to set up a connection (usually by allocating
	 *     an unbound 'listener' port and avertising that via a storage service
	 *     such as xenstore).
	 *  2. Physical interrupts. A domain with suitable hardware-access
	 *     privileges can bind an event-channel port to a physical interrupt
	 *     source.
	 *  3. Virtual interrupts ('events'). A domain can bind an event-channel
	 *     port to a virtual interrupt source, such as the virtual-timer
	 *     device or the emergency console.
	 *
	 * Event channels are addressed by a "port index". Each channel is
	 * associated with two bits of information:
	 *  1. PENDING -- notifies the domain that there is a pending notification
	 *     to be processed. This bit is cleared by the guest.
	 *  2. MASK -- if this bit is clear then a 0->1 transition of PENDING
	 *     will cause an asynchronous upcall to be scheduled. This bit is only
	 *     updated by the guest. It is read-only within Xen. If a channel
	 *     becomes pending while the channel is masked then the 'edge' is lost
	 *     (i.e., when the channel is unmasked, the guest must manually handle
	 *     pending notifications as no upcall will be scheduled by Xen).
	 *
	 * To expedite scanning of pending notifications, any 0->1 pending
	 * transition on an unmasked channel causes a corresponding bit in a
	 * per-vcpu selector word to be set. Each bit in the selector covers a
	 * 'C long' in the PENDING bitfield array.
