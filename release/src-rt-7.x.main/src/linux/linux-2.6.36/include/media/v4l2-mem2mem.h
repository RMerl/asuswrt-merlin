/**
 * struct v4l2_m2m_ops - mem-to-mem device driver callbacks
 * @device_run:	required. Begin the actual job (transaction) inside this
 *		callback.
 *		The job does NOT have to end before this callback returns
 *		(and it will be the usual case). When the job finishes,
 *		v4l2_m2m_job_finish() has to be called.
 * @job_ready:	optional. Should return 0 if the driver does not have a job
 *		fully prepared to run yet (i.e. it will not be able to finish a
 *		transaction without sleeping). If not provided, it will be
 *		assumed that one source and one destination buffer are all
 *		that is required for the driver to perform one full transaction.
 *		This method may not sleep.
 * @job_abort:	required. Informs the driver that it has to abort the currently
 *		running transaction as soon as possible (i.e. as soon as it can
 *		stop the device safely; e.g. in the next interrupt handler),
 *		even if the transaction would not have been finished by then.
 *		After the driver performs the necessary steps, it has to call
 *		v4l2_m2m_job_finish() (as if the transaction ended normally).
 *		This function does not have to (and will usually not) wait
 *		until the device enters a state when it can be stopped.
