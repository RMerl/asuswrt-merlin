 *              Extract the name and GPE type from the object, saving this

 *              walk_info parameter block.
 *
 *              The name of each GPE control method is of the form:
 *              "_Lxx" or "_Exx", where:
 *                  L      - means that the GPE is level triggered

 *                  xx     - is the GPE number [in HEX]
 *
 * If walk_info->execute_by_owner_id is TRUE, we only execute examine GPE methods
 *    with that owner.
 * If walk_info->enable_this_gpe is TRUE, the GPE that is referred to by a GPE
 *    method is immediately enabled (Used for Load/load_table operators)
