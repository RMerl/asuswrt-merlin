    This is a device driver for the 3Com Etherlink 3c501.
    Do not purchase this card, even as a joke.  It's performance is horrible,
    and it breaks in many ways.

    Fixed (again!) the missing interrupt locking on TX/RX shifting.
	Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>

    Removed calls to init_etherdev since they are no longer needed, and
    cleaned up modularization just a bit. The driver still allows only
    the default address for cards when loaded as a module, but that's
    really less braindead than anyone using a 3c501 board. :)
		    19950208 (invid@msen.com)

    Added traps for interrupts hitting the window as we clear and TX load
    the board. Now getting 150K/second FTP with a 3c501 card. Still playing
    with a TX-TX optimisation to see if we can touch 180-200K/second as seems
    theoretically maximum.
		19950402 Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>

    Cleaned up for 2.3.x because we broke SMP now.
		20000208 Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>

    Check up pass for 2.5. Nothing significant changed
		20021009 Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>

    Fixed zero fill corner case

   For the avoidance of doubt the "preferred form" of this code is one which
   is in an open non patent encumbered format. Where cryptographic key signing
   forms part of the process of creating an executable the information
   including keys needed to generate an equivalently functional executable
   are deemed to be part of the source code.

/**
 * DOC: 3c501 Card Notes
 *
 *  Some notes on this thing if you have to hack it.  [Alan]
 *
 *  Some documentation is available from 3Com. Due to the boards age
 *  standard responses when you ask for this will range from 'be serious'
 *  to 'give it to a museum'. The documentation is incomplete and mostly
 *  of historical interest anyway.
 *
 *  The basic system is a single buffer which can be used to receive or
 *  transmit a packet. A third command mode exists when you are setting
 *  things up.
 *
 *  If it's transmitting it's not receiving and vice versa. In fact the
 *  time to get the board back into useful state after an operation is
 *  quite large.
 *
 *  The driver works by keeping the board in receive mode waiting for a
 *  packet to arrive. When one arrives it is copied out of the buffer
 *  and delivered to the kernel. The card is reloaded and off we go.
 *
 *  When transmitting lp->txing is set and the card is reset (from
 *  receive mode) [possibly losing a packet just received] to command
 *  mode. A packet is loaded and transmit mode triggered. The interrupt
 *  handler runs different code for transmit interrupts and can handle
 *  returning to receive mode or retransmissions (yes you have to help
 *  out with those too).
 *
 * DOC: Problems
 *
 *  There are a wide variety of undocumented error returns from the card
 *  and you basically have to kick the board and pray if they turn up. Most
 *  only occur under extreme load or if you do something the board doesn't
 *  like (eg touching a register at the wrong time).
 *
 *  The driver is less efficient than it could be. It switches through
 *  receive mode even if more transmits are queued. If this worries you buy
 *  a real Ethernet card.
 *
 *  The combination of slow receive restart and no real multicast
 *  filter makes the board unusable with a kernel compiled for IP
 *  multicasting in a real multicast environment. That's down to the board,
 *  but even with no multicast programs running a multicast IP kernel is
 *  in group 224.0.0.1 and you will therefore be listening to all multicasts.
 *  One nv conference running over that Ethernet and you can give up.

 *
 * On the receive side the card is also very dumb. It has no buffering to
