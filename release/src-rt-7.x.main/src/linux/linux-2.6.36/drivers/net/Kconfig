	bool "Network device support"
	---help---
	  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
	  any other computer at all.

	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
	  you want to use under Linux. If you are going to run SLIP or PPP over
	  telephone line or null modem cable you need say Y here. Connecting
	  two machines with parallel ports using PLIP needs this, as well as
	  AX.25/KISS for sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links.

	  See also "The Linux Network Administrator's Guide" by Olaf Kirch and
	  Terry Dawson. Available at <http://www.tldp.org/guides.html>.

	---help---
	  This is an intermediate driver that allows sharing of
	  resources.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ifb.  If you want to use more than one ifb
	  device at a time, you need to compile this driver as a module.
	  Instead of 'ifb', the devices will then be called 'ifb0',
	  'ifb1' etc.
	  Look at the iproute2 documentation directory for usage etc

config DUMMY
	tristate "Dummy net driver support"
	---help---
	  This is essentially a bit-bucket device (i.e. traffic you send to
	  this device is consigned into oblivion) with a configurable IP
	  address. It is most commonly used in order to make your currently
	  inactive SLIP address seem like a real address for local programs.
	  If you use SLIP or PPP, you might want to say Y here. Since this
	  thing often comes in handy, the default is Y. It won't enlarge your
	  kernel either. What a deal. Read about it in the Network
	  Administrator's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called dummy.  If you want to use more than one dummy
	  device at a time, you need to compile this driver as a module.

	  Say 'Y' or 'M' if you wish to be able to 'bond' multiple Ethernet
	  Channels together. This is called 'Etherchannel' by Cisco,
	  'Trunking' by Sun, 802.3ad by the IEEE, and 'Bonding' in Linux.

	  The driver supports multiple bonding modes to allow for both high
	  performance and high availability operation.

	  Refer to <file:Documentation/networking/bonding.txt> for more

	  Macvlan devices can be added using the "ip" command from the
	  iproute2 package starting with the iproute2-2.6.23 release:

	  "ip link add link <real dev> [ address MAC ] [ NAME ] type macvlan"

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called macvlan.

config MACVTAP
	tristate "MAC-VLAN based tap driver (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on MACVLAN
	help
	  This adds a specialized tap character device driver that is based
	  on the MAC-VLAN network interface, called macvtap. A macvtap device
	  can be added in the same way as a macvlan device, using 'type
	  macvlan', and then be accessed through the tap user space interface.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called macvtap.

config EQUALIZER
	tristate "EQL (serial line load balancing) support"
	---help---
	  If you have two serial connections to some other computer (this
	  usually requires two modems and two telephone lines) and you use
	  SLIP (the protocol for sending Internet traffic over telephone
	  lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave like
	  one double speed connection using this driver.  Naturally, this has
	  to be supported at the other end as well, either with a similar EQL
	  Linux driver or with a Livingston Portmaster 2e.

	  Say Y if you want this and read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/eql.txt>.  You may also want to read
	  section 6.2 of the NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

config TUN
	tristate "Universal TUN/TAP device driver support"
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space
	  programs.  It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet
	  device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical media,
	  receives them from user space program and instead of sending packets
	  via physical media writes them to the user space program.

	  When a program opens /dev/net/tun, driver creates and registers
	  corresponding net device tunX or tapX.  After a program closed above
	  devices, driver will automatically delete tunXX or tapXX device and
	  all routes corresponding to it.

	  Please read <file:Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt> for more
	  information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called tun.

	  If you don't know what to use this for, you don't need it.

config VETH
	tristate "Virtual ethernet pair device"

	  This device is a local ethernet tunnel. Devices are created in pairs.
	  When one end receives the packet it appears on its pair and vice
	  versa.

config NET_SB1000
	tristate "General Instruments Surfboard 1000"
	depends on PNP
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the General Instrument (also known as
	  NextLevel) SURFboard 1000 internal
	  cable modem. This is an ISA card which is used by a number of cable
	  TV companies to provide cable modem access. It's a one-way
	  downstream-only cable modem, meaning that your upstream net link is
	  provided by your regular phone modem.

	  At present this driver only compiles as a module, so say M here if
	  you have this card. The module will be called sb1000. Then read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/README.sb1000> for information on how
	  to use this module, as it needs special ppp scripts for establishing
	  a connection. Further documentation and the necessary scripts can be
	  found at:

	depends on !UML
	---help---
	  Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common
	  type of Local Area Network (LAN) in universities and companies.

	  Common varieties of Ethernet are: 10BASE-2 or Thinnet (10 Mbps over
	  coaxial cable, linking computers in a chain), 10BASE-T or twisted
	  pair (10 Mbps over twisted pair cable, linking computers to central
	  hubs), 10BASE-F (10 Mbps over optical fiber links, using hubs),
	  100BASE-TX (100 Mbps over two twisted pair cables, using hubs),
	  100BASE-T4 (100 Mbps over 4 standard voice-grade twisted pair
	  cables, using hubs), 100BASE-FX (100 Mbps over optical fiber links)
	  [the 100BASE varieties are also known as Fast Ethernet], and Gigabit
	  Ethernet (1 Gbps over optical fiber or short copper links).

	  If your Linux machine will be connected to an Ethernet and you have
	  an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) installed in your computer,
	  say Y here and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You will then also have
	  to say Y to the driver for your particular NIC.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the

	  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
	  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
	  enabled for this to work.

	  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
	  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
	  with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
	  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
	  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
	  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
	  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
	  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
	  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
	  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.

	  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well

config PPP

	  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves

	  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
	  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
	  days support PPP rather than SLIP.

	  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
	  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
	  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
	  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

	  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
	  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
	  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
	  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
	  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
	  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
	  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
	  synchronous PPP", below.

	  If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above, then
	  you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only
	  compile it as a module. To compile this driver as a module, choose M
	  here. The module will be called ppp_generic.

	  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,
	  it is safe to say Y here.

	  The PPP Deflate compression method ("PPP Deflate compression",
	  above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better
	  and is patent-free.

	  Adds additional capabilities to the SLIP driver to support the
	  RELCOM line fill and keepalive monitoring. Ideal on poor quality
	  analogue lines.

config SLIP_MODE_SLIP6
	bool "Six bit SLIP encapsulation"
	depends on SLIP
	help
	  Just occasionally you may need to run IP over hostile serial
	  networks that don't pass all control characters or are only seven
	  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:
	  "slip6". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over
	  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other
	  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP
	  over the async ports of a Camtec JNT Pad. If unsure, say N.

config NET_FC
	bool "Fibre Channel driver support"
	depends on SCSI && PCI
	help
	  Fibre Channel is a high speed serial protocol mainly used to connect
	  large storage devices to the computer; it is compatible with and
	  intended to replace SCSI.

	  If you intend to use Fibre Channel, you need to have a Fibre channel
	  adaptor card in your computer; say Y here and to the driver for your
	  adaptor below. You also should have said Y to "SCSI support" and
	  "SCSI generic support".

config NETCONSOLE
	tristate "Network console logging support"
	---help---
	If you want to log kernel messages over the network, enable this.
	See <file:Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt> for details.

config NETCONSOLE_DYNAMIC
	bool "Dynamic reconfiguration of logging targets"
	depends on NETCONSOLE && SYSFS
	select CONFIGFS_FS
	help
	  This option enables the ability to dynamically reconfigure target
	  parameters (interface, IP addresses, port numbers, MAC addresses)
	  at runtime through a userspace interface exported using configfs.
	  See <file:Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt> for details.

config VIRTIO_NET
	tristate "Virtio network driver (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && VIRTIO
	---help---
	  This is the virtual network driver for virtio.  It can be used with
          lguest or QEMU based VMMs (like KVM or Xen).  Say Y or M.

config VMXNET3
       tristate "VMware VMXNET3 ethernet driver"
       depends on PCI && INET
       help
         This driver supports VMware's vmxnet3 virtual ethernet NIC.
         To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
         module will be called vmxnet3.
