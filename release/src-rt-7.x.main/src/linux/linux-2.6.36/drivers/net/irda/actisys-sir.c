 * Define the timing of the pulses we send to the dongle (to reset it, and
 * to toggle speeds). Basically, the limit here is the propagation speed of
 * the signals through the serial port, the dongle being much faster.  Any
 * serial port support 115 kb/s, so we are sure that pulses 8.5 us wide can
 * go through cleanly . If you are on the wild side, you can try to lower
 * this value (Actisys recommended me 2 us, and 0 us work for me on a P233!)

 *
 *	First, we reset the dongle to always start from a known state.
 *	Then, we cycle through the speeds by pulsing RTS low and then up.
 *	The dongle allow us to pulse quite fast, se we can set speed in one go,
 * which is must faster ( < 100 us) and less complex than what is found
 * in some other dongle drivers...
 *	Note that even if the new speed is the same as the current speed,
 * we reassert the speed. This make sure that things are all right,
 * and it's fast anyway...
 *	By the way, this function will work for both type of dongles,
 * because the additional speed is at the end of the sequence...

 *	o first make sure that the dongle is in a state where it can operate
 *	o second put the dongle in a know state
 *
 *	The dongle is powered of the RTS and DTR lines. In the dongle, there
 * is a big capacitor to accommodate the current spikes. This capacitor
 * takes a least 50 ms to be charged. In theory, the Bios set those lines
 * up, so by the time we arrive here we should be set. It doesn't hurt
 * to be on the conservative side, so we will wait...
 * <Martin : move above comment to irda_config_fsm>
 *	Then, we set the speed to 9600 b/s to get in a known state (see in
 * change_speed for details). It is needed because the IrDA stack
 * has tried to set the speed immediately after our first return,
 * so before we can be sure the dongle is up and running.
