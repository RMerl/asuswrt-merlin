 *  - Initial implementation
 * Inaky Perez-Gonzalez <inaky.perez-gonzalez@intel.com>
 *  - Use skb_clone(), break up processing in chunks
 *  - Split transport/device specific
 *  - Make buffer size dynamic to exert less memory pressure
 *  - RX reorder support
 *
 * This handles the RX path.
 *
 * We receive an RX message from the bus-specific driver, which
 * contains one or more payloads that have potentially different
 * destinataries (data or control paths).
 *
 * So we just take that payload from the transport specific code in
 * the form of an skb, break it up in chunks (a cloned skb each in the
 * case of network packets) and pass it to netdev or to the
 * command/ack handler (and from there to the WiMAX stack).
 *
 * PROTOCOL FORMAT
 *
 * The format of the buffer is:
 *
 * HEADER                      (struct i2400m_msg_hdr)
 * PAYLOAD DESCRIPTOR 0        (struct i2400m_pld)
 * PAYLOAD DESCRIPTOR 1
 * ...
 * PAYLOAD DESCRIPTOR N
 * PAYLOAD 0                   (raw bytes)
 * PAYLOAD 1
 * ...
 * PAYLOAD N
 *
 * See tx.c for a deeper description on alignment requirements and
 * other fun facts of it.
 *
 * DATA PACKETS
 *
 * In firmwares <= v1.3, data packets have no header for RX, but they
 * do for TX (currently unused).
 *
 * In firmware >= 1.4, RX packets have an extended header (16
 * bytes). This header conveys information for management of host
 * reordering of packets (the device offloads storage of the packets
 * for reordering to the host). Read below for more information.
 *
 * The header is used as dummy space to emulate an ethernet header and
 * thus be able to act as an ethernet device without having to reallocate.
 *
 * DATA RX REORDERING
 *
 * Starting in firmware v1.4, the device can deliver packets for
 * delivery with special reordering information; this allows it to
 * more effectively do packet management when some frames were lost in
 * the radio traffic.
 *
 * Thus, for RX packets that come out of order, the device gives the
 * driver enough information to queue them properly and then at some
 * point, the signal to deliver the whole (or part) of the queued
 * packets to the networking stack. There are 16 such queues.
 *
 * This only happens when a packet comes in with the "need reorder"
 * flag set in the RX header. When such bit is set, the following
 * operations might be indicated:
 *
 *  - reset queue: send all queued packets to the OS
 *
 *  - queue: queue a packet
 *
 *  - update ws: update the queue's window start and deliver queued
 *    packets that meet the criteria
 *
 *  - queue & update ws: queue a packet, update the window start and
 *    deliver queued packets that meet the criteria
 *
 * (delivery criteria: the packet's [normalized] sequence number is
 * lower than the new [normalized] window start).
 *
 * See the i2400m_roq_*() functions for details.

 *
 * If it is a report, we run hooks on it (to extract information for

/**
 * i2400m_rx - Receive a buffer of data from the device
 *
 * @i2400m: device descriptor
 * @skb: skbuff where the data has been received
 *
 * Parse in a buffer of data that contains an RX message sent from the
 * device. See the file header for the format. Run all checks on the
 * buffer header, then run over each payload's descriptors, verify
 * their consistency and act on each payload's contents.  If
 * everything is successful, update the device's statistics.
 *
 * Note: You need to set the skb to contain only the length of the
 * received buffer; for that, use skb_trim(skb, RECEIVED_SIZE).
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 * 0 if ok, < 0 errno on error
 *
 * If ok, this function owns now the skb and the caller DOESN'T have
 * to run kfree_skb() on it. However, on error, the caller still owns
 * the skb and it is responsible for releasing it.
