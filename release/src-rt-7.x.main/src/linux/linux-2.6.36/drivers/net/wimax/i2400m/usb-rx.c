 *  - Use skb_clone(), break up processing in chunks
 *  - Split transport/device specific
 *  - Make buffer size dynamic to exert less memory pressure
 *
 *
 * This handles the RX path on USB.
 *
 * When a notification is received that says 'there is RX data ready',
 * we call i2400mu_rx_kick(); that wakes up the RX kthread, which
 * reads a buffer from USB and passes it to i2400m_rx() in the generic
 * handling code. The RX buffer has an specific format that is
 * described in rx.c.
 *
 * We use a kernel thread in a loop because:
 *
 *  - we want to be able to call the USB power management get/put
 *    functions (blocking) before each transaction.
 *
 *  - We might get a lot of notifications and we don't want to submit
 *    a zillion reads; by serializing, we are throttling.
 *
 *  - RX data processing can get heavy enough so that it is not
 *    appropiate for doing it in the USB callback; thus we run it in a
 *    process context.
 *
 * We provide a read buffer of an arbitrary size (short of a page); if
 * the callback reports -EOVERFLOW, it means it was too small, so we
 * just double the size and retry (being careful to append, as
 * sometimes the device provided some data). Every now and then we
 * check if the average packet size is smaller than the current packet
 * size and if so, we halve it. At the end, the size of the
 * preallocated buffer should be following the average received
 * transaction size, adapting dynamically to it.
 *

 *   			           'data ready' notification

/*
 * Dynamic RX size
 *
 * We can't let the rx_size be a multiple of 512 bytes (the RX
 * endpoint's max packet size). On some USB host controllers (we
 * haven't been able to fully characterize which), if the device is
 * about to send (for example) X bytes and we only post a buffer to
 * receive n*512, it will fail to mark that as babble (so that
 * i2400mu_rx() [case -EOVERFLOW] can resize the buffer and get the
 * rest).
 *
 * So on growing or shrinking, if it is a multiple of the
 * maxpacketsize, we remove some (instead of incresing some, so in a
 * buddy allocator we try to waste less space).
 *
 * Note we also need a hook for this on i2400mu_rx() -- when we do the
 * first read, we are sure we won't hit this spot because
 * i240mm->rx_size has been set properly. However, if we have to
 * double because of -EOVERFLOW, when we launch the read to get the
 * rest of the data, we *have* to make sure that also is not a
 * multiple of the max_pkt_size.
