 *  - Initial implementation
 *
 *
 * THE PROCEDURE
 *
 * The 2400m and derived devices work in two modes: boot-mode or
 * normal mode. In boot mode we can execute only a handful of commands
 * targeted at uploading the firmware and launching it.
 *
 * The 2400m enters boot mode when it is first connected to the
 * system, when it crashes and when you ask it to reboot. There are
 * two submodes of the boot mode: signed and non-signed. Signed takes
 * firmwares signed with a certain private key, non-signed takes any
 * firmware. Normal hardware takes only signed firmware.
 *
 * On boot mode, in USB, we write to the device using the bulk out
 * endpoint and read from it in the notification endpoint. In SDIO we
 * talk to it via the write address and read from the read address.
 *
 * Upon entrance to boot mode, the device sends (preceeded with a few
 * zero length packets (ZLPs) on the notification endpoint in USB) a
 * reboot barker (4 le32 words with the same value). We ack it by
 * sending the same barker to the device. The device acks with a
 * reboot ack barker (4 le32 words with value I2400M_ACK_BARKER) and
 * then is fully booted. At this point we can upload the firmware.
 *
 * Note that different iterations of the device and EEPROM
 * configurations will send different [re]boot barkers; these are
 * collected in i2400m_barker_db along with the firmware
 * characteristics they require.
 *
 * This process is accomplished by the i2400m_bootrom_init()
 * function. All the device interaction happens through the
 * i2400m_bm_cmd() [boot mode command]. Special return values will
 * indicate if the device did reset during the process.
 *
 * After this, we read the MAC address and then (if needed)
 * reinitialize the device. We need to read it ahead of time because
 * in the future, we might not upload the firmware until userspace
 * 'ifconfig up's the device.
 *
 * We can then upload the firmware file. The file is composed of a BCF
 * header (basic data, keys and signatures) and a list of write
 * commands and payloads. Optionally more BCF headers might follow the
 * main payload. We first upload the header [i2400m_dnload_init()] and
 * then pass the commands and payloads verbatim to the i2400m_bm_cmd()
 * function [i2400m_dnload_bcf()]. Then we tell the device to jump to
 * the new firmware [i2400m_dnload_finalize()].
 *
 * Once firmware is uploaded, we are good to go :)
 *
 * When we don't know in which mode we are, we first try by sending a
 * warm reset request that will take us to boot-mode. If we time out
 * waiting for a reboot barker, that means maybe we are already in
 * boot mode, so we send a reboot barker.
 *
 * COMMAND EXECUTION
 *
 * This code (and process) is single threaded; for executing commands,
 * we post a URB to the notification endpoint, post the command, wait
 * for data on the notification buffer. We don't need to worry about
 * others as we know we are the only ones in there.
 *
 * BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * This code is bus-generic; the bus-specific driver provides back end
 * implementations to send a boot mode command to the device and to
 * read an acknolwedgement from it (or an asynchronous notification)
 * from it.
 *
 * FIRMWARE LOADING
 *
 * Note that in some cases, we can't just load a firmware file (for
 * example, when resuming). For that, we might cache the firmware
 * file. Thus, when doing the bootstrap, if there is a cache firmware
 * file, it is used; if not, loading from disk is attempted.

 * i2400m_bootrom_init - Reboots a powered device into boot mode
 *
 * @i2400m: device descriptor
 * @flags:
 *      I2400M_BRI_SOFT: a reboot barker has been seen
 *          already, so don't wait for it.
 *
 *      I2400M_BRI_NO_REBOOT: Don't send a reboot command, but wait
 *          for a reboot barker notification. This is a one shot; if
 *          the state machine needs to send a reboot command it will.
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 *     < 0 errno code on error, 0 if ok.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * Tries hard enough to put the device in boot-mode. There are two
 * main phases to this:
 *
 * a. (1) send a reboot command and (2) get a reboot barker
 *
 * b. (1) echo/ack the reboot sending the reboot barker back and (2)
 *        getting an ack barker in return
 *
 * We want to skip (a) in some cases [soft]. The state machine is
 * horrible, but it is basically: on each phase, send what has to be
 * sent (if any), wait for the answer and act on the answer. We might
 * have to backtrack and retry, so we keep a max tries counter for
 * that.
 *
 * It sucks because we don't know ahead of time which is going to be
 * the reboot barker (the device might send different ones depending
 * on its EEPROM config) and once the device reboots and waits for the
 * echo/ack reboot barker being sent back, it doesn't understand
 * anything else. So we can be left at the point where we don't know
 * what to send to it -- cold reset and bus reset seem to have little
 * effect. So the function iterates (in this case) through all the
 * known barkers and tries them all until an ACK is
 * received. Otherwise, it gives up.
 *
 * If we get a timeout after sending a warm reset, we do it again.
