/**
 * Rx SRAM Control and Status Registers (RSCSR)
 *
 * These registers provide handshake between driver and 4965 for the Rx queue
 * (this queue handles *all* command responses, notifications, Rx data, etc.
 * sent from 4965 uCode to host driver).  Unlike Tx, there is only one Rx
 * queue, and only one Rx DMA/FIFO channel.  Also unlike Tx, which can
 * concatenate up to 20 DRAM buffers to form a Tx frame, each Receive Buffer
 * Descriptor (RBD) points to only one Rx Buffer (RB); there is a 1:1
 * mapping between RBDs and RBs.
 *
 * Driver must allocate host DRAM memory for the following, and set the
 * physical address of each into 4965 registers:
 *
 * 1)  Receive Buffer Descriptor (RBD) circular buffer (CB), typically with 256
 *     entries (although any power of 2, up to 4096, is selectable by driver).
 *     Each entry (1 dword) points to a receive buffer (RB) of consistent size
 *     (typically 4K, although 8K or 16K are also selectable by driver).
 *     Driver sets up RB size and number of RBDs in the CB via Rx config
 *     register FH_MEM_RCSR_CHNL0_CONFIG_REG.
 *
 *     Bit fields within one RBD:
 *     27-0:  Receive Buffer physical address bits [35:8], 256-byte aligned
 *
 *     Driver sets physical address [35:8] of base of RBD circular buffer
 *     into FH_RSCSR_CHNL0_RBDCB_BASE_REG [27:0].
 *
 * 2)  Rx status buffer, 8 bytes, in which 4965 indicates which Rx Buffers
 *     (RBs) have been filled, via a "write pointer", actually the index of
 *     the RB's corresponding RBD within the circular buffer.  Driver sets
 *     physical address [35:4] into FH_RSCSR_CHNL0_STTS_WPTR_REG [31:0].
 *
 *     Bit fields in lower dword of Rx status buffer (upper dword not used
 *     by driver; see struct iwl4965_shared, val0):
 *     31-12:  Not used by driver
 *     11- 0:  Index of last filled Rx buffer descriptor
 *             (4965 writes, driver reads this value)
 *
 * As the driver prepares Receive Buffers (RBs) for 4965 to fill, driver must
 * enter pointers to these RBs into contiguous RBD circular buffer entries,
 * and update the 4965's "write" index register,
 * FH_RSCSR_CHNL0_RBDCB_WPTR_REG.
 *
 * This "write" index corresponds to the *next* RBD that the driver will make
 * available, i.e. one RBD past the tail of the ready-to-fill RBDs within
 * the circular buffer.  This value should initially be 0 (before preparing any
 * RBs), should be 8 after preparing the first 8 RBs (for example), and must
 * wrap back to 0 at the end of the circular buffer (but don't wrap before
 * "read" index has advanced past 1!  See below).
 * NOTE:  4965 EXPECTS THE WRITE INDEX TO BE INCREMENTED IN MULTIPLES OF 8.
 *
 * As the 4965 fills RBs (referenced from contiguous RBDs within the circular
 * buffer), it updates the Rx status buffer in host DRAM, 2) described above,
 * to tell the driver the index of the latest filled RBD.  The driver must
 * read this "read" index from DRAM after receiving an Rx interrupt from 4965.
 *
 * The driver must also internally keep track of a third index, which is the
 * next RBD to process.  When receiving an Rx interrupt, driver should process
 * all filled but unprocessed RBs up to, but not including, the RB
 * corresponding to the "read" index.  For example, if "read" index becomes "1",
 * driver may process the RB pointed to by RBD 0.  Depending on volume of
 * traffic, there may be many RBs to process.
 *
 * If read index == write index, 4965 thinks there is no room to put new data.
 * Due to this, the maximum number of filled RBs is 255, instead of 256.  To
 * be safe, make sure that there is a gap of at least 2 RBDs between "write"
 * and "read" indexes; that is, make sure that there are no more than 254
 * buffers waiting to be filled.

 *
 * Each Tx queue uses a circular buffer of 256 TFDs stored in host DRAM.
 * Both driver and device share these circular buffers, each of which must be
 * contiguous 256 TFDs x 128 bytes-per-TFD = 32 KBytes
 *
 * Driver must indicate the physical address of the base of each
 * circular buffer via the FH_MEM_CBBC_QUEUE registers.
 *
 * Each TFD contains pointer/size information for up to 20 data buffers
 * in host DRAM.  These buffers collectively contain the (one) frame described
 * by the TFD.  Each buffer must be a single contiguous block of memory within
 * itself, but buffers may be scattered in host DRAM.  Each buffer has max size
 * of (4K - 4).  The concatenates all of a TFD's buffers into a single
 * Tx frame, up to 8 KBytes in size.
 *
 * A maximum of 255 (not 256!) TFDs may be on a queue waiting for Tx.
