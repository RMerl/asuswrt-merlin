/*
 * InfiniPath I2C driver for a serial eeprom.  This is not a generic
 * I2C interface.  For a start, the device we're using (Atmel AT24C11)
 * doesn't work like a regular I2C device.  It looks like one
 * electrically, but not logically.  Normal I2C devices have a single
 * 7-bit or 10-bit I2C address that they respond to.  Valid 7-bit
 * addresses range from 0x03 to 0x77.  Addresses 0x00 to 0x02 and 0x78
 * to 0x7F are special reserved addresses (e.g. 0x00 is the "general
 * call" address.)  The Atmel device, on the other hand, responds to ALL
 * 7-bit addresses.  It's designed to be the only device on a given I2C
 * bus.  A 7-bit address corresponds to the memory address within the
 * Atmel device itself.
 *
 * Also, the timing requirements mean more than simple software
 * bitbanging, with readbacks from chip to ensure timing (simple udelay
 * is not enough).
 *
 * This all means that accessing the device is specialized enough
 * that using the standard kernel I2C bitbanging interface would be
 * impossible.  For example, the core I2C eeprom driver expects to find
 * a device at one or more of a limited set of addresses only.  It doesn't
 * allow writing to an eeprom.  It also doesn't provide any means of
 * accessing eeprom contents from within the kernel, only via sysfs.
