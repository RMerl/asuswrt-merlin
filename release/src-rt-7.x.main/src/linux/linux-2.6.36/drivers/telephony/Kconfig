	  Say Y here if you have a telephony card, which for example allows
	  you to use a regular phone for voice-over-IP applications.

	  Note: this has nothing to do with modems.  You do not need to say Y
	  here in order to be able to use a modem under Linux.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called phonedev.

	---help---
	  Say M if you have a telephony card manufactured by Quicknet
	  Technologies, Inc.  These include the Internet PhoneJACK and
	  Internet LineJACK Telephony Cards. You will get a module called
	  ixj.

	  For the ISA versions of these products, you can configure the
	  cards using the isapnp tools (pnpdump/isapnp) or you can use the
	  isapnp support.  Please read <file:Documentation/telephony/ixj.txt>.

	  For more information on these cards, see Quicknet's web site at:
	  <http://www.quicknet.net/>.

	  If you do not have any Quicknet telephony cards, you can safely
	  say N here.

	tristate "QuickNet Internet LineJack/PhoneJack PCMCIA support"
	depends on PHONE_IXJ && PCMCIA
	help
	  Say Y here to configure in PCMCIA service support for the Quicknet

	  card initialization code to work with the card manager daemon.
