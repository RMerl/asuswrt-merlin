config DVB_MAX_ADAPTERS
	int "maximum number of DVB/ATSC adapters"
	depends on DVB_CORE
	default 8
	range 1 255
	help
	  Maximum number of DVB/ATSC adapters. Increasing this number
	  increases the memory consumption of the DVB subsystem even
	  if a much lower number of DVB/ATSC adapters is present.
	  Only values in the range 4-32 are tested.

	  If you are unsure about this, use the default value 8

config DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS
	bool "Dynamic DVB minor allocation"
	depends on DVB_CORE
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, the DVB subsystem will use dynamic minor
	  allocation for any device that uses the DVB major number.
	  This means that you can have more than 4 of a single type
	  of device (like demuxes and frontends) per adapter, but udev
	  will be required to manage the device nodes.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

menuconfig DVB_CAPTURE_DRIVERS
	bool "DVB/ATSC adapters"
	depends on DVB_CORE
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y to select Digital TV adapters
