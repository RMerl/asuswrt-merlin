	bool "Multifunction device drivers"

	default y
	help
	  Multifunction devices embed several functions (e.g. GPIOs,
	  touchscreens, keyboards, current regulators, power management chips,
	  etc...) in one single integrated circuit. They usually talk to the
	  main CPU through one or more IRQ lines and low speed data busses (SPI,
	  I2C, etc..). They appear as one single device to the main system
	  through the data bus and the MFD framework allows for sub devices
	  (a.k.a. functions) to appear as discrete platform devices.
	  MFDs are typically found on embedded platforms.

	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.
