	---help---
	  This kernel module can be loaded in host kernel to accelerate
	  guest networking with virtio_net. Not to be confused with virtio_net
	  module itself which needs to be loaded in guest kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called vhost_net.
