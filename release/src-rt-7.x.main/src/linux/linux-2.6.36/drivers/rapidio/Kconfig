config RAPIDIO_DISC_TIMEOUT
	int "Discovery timeout duration (seconds)"
	depends on RAPIDIO
	default "30"

	  Amount of time a discovery node waits for a host to complete
	  enumeration before giving up.

config RAPIDIO_ENABLE_RX_TX_PORTS
	bool "Enable RapidIO Input/Output Ports"
	depends on RAPIDIO
	---help---
	  The RapidIO specification describes a Output port transmit
	  enable and a Input port receive enable. The recommended state
	  for Input ports and Output ports should be disabled. When
	  this switch is set the RapidIO subsystem will enable all
	  ports for Input/Output direction to allow other traffic
	  than Maintenance transfers.

config RAPIDIO_DEBUG
	bool "RapidIO subsystem debug messages"
	depends on RAPIDIO
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the RapidIO subsystem to produce a bunch of
	  debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
	  problem with the RapidIO subsystem and want to see more of what is
	  going on.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.
