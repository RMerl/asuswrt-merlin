** HostUniqueNum is the unique number from the host card that this RTA
** is to be connected to.
** RtaUniqueNum is the unique number of the RTA concerned. It will be ZERO
** if the slot in the table is unused. If it is the same as the HostUniqueNum
** then this slot represents a host card.
** Flags contains current boot/route state info
** SysPort is a value in the range 0-504, being the number of the first tty
** on this RTA. Each RTA supports 8 ports. The SysPort value must be modulo 8.
** SysPort 0-127 correspond to /dev/ttyr001 to /dev/ttyr128, with minor
** numbers 0-127. SysPort 128-255 correspond to /dev/ttyr129 to /dev/ttyr256,
** again with minor numbers 0-127, and so on for SysPorts 256-383 and 384-511
** ID will be in the range 0-16 for a `known' RTA. ID will be 0xFFFF for an
** unused slot/unknown ID etc.
** The Topology array contains the ID of the unit connected to each of the
** four links on this unit. The entry will be 0xFFFF if NOTHING is connected
** to the link, or will be 0xFF00 if an UNKNOWN unit is connected to the link.
** The Name field is a null-terminated string, upto 31 characters, containing
** the 'cute' name that the sysadmin/users know the RTA by. It is permissible
** for this string to contain any character in the range \040 to \176 inclusive.
** In particular, ctrl sequences and DEL (0x7F, \177) are not allowed. The
** special character '%' IS allowable, and needs no special action.
