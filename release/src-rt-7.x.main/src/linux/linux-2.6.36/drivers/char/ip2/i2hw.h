HARDWARE DESCRIPTION:

Introduction:

The IntelliPort-II and IntelliPort-IIEX products occupy a block of eight (8)
addresses in the host's I/O space.

Some addresses are used to transfer data to/from the board, some to transfer
so-called "mailbox" messages, and some to read bit-mapped status information.
While all the products in the line are functionally similar, some use a 16-bit
data path to transfer data while others use an 8-bit path. Also, the use of
command /status/mailbox registers differs slightly between the II and IIEX
branches of the family.

The host determines what type of board it is dealing with by reading a string of
sixteen characters from the board. These characters are always placed in the
fifo by the board's local processor whenever the board is reset (either from
power-on or under software control) and are known as the "Power-on Reset
Message." In order that this message can be read from either type of board, the
hardware registers used in reading this message are the same. Once this message
has been read by the host, then it has the information required to operate.

General Differences between boards:

The greatest structural difference is between the -II and -IIEX families of
product. The -II boards use the Am4701 dual 512x8 bidirectional fifo to support
the data path, mailbox registers, and status registers. This chip contains some
features which are not used in the IntelliPort-II products; a description of
these is omitted here. Because of these many features, it contains many
registers, too many to access directly within a small address space. They are
accessed by first writing a value to a "pointer" register. This value selects
the register to be accessed.  The next read or write to that address accesses
the selected register rather than the pointer register.

The -IIEX boards use a proprietary design similar to the Am4701 in function. But
because of a simpler, more streamlined design it doesn't require so many
registers. This means they can be accessed directly in single operations rather
than through a pointer register.

Besides these differences, there are differences in whether 8-bit or 16-bit
transfers are used to move data to the board.

The -II boards are capable only of 8-bit data transfers, while the -IIEX boards
may be configured for either 8-bit or 16-bit data transfers. If the on-board DIP
switch #8 is ON, and the card has been installed in a 16-bit slot, 16-bit
transfers are supported (and will be expected by the standard loadware). The
on-board firmware can determine the position of the switch, and whether the
board is installed in a 16-bit slot; it supplies this information to the host as
part of the power-up reset message.

The configuration switch (#8) and slot selection do not directly configure the
hardware. It is up to the on-board loadware and host-based drivers to act
according to the selected options. That is, loadware and drivers could be
written to perform 8-bit transfers regardless of the state of the DIP switch or
slot (and in a diagnostic environment might well do so). Likewise, 16-bit
transfers could be performed as long as the card is in a 16-bit slot.

Note the slot selection and DIP switch selection are provided separately: a
board running in 8-bit mode in a 16-bit slot has a greater range of possible
interrupts to choose from; information of potential use to the host.

All 8-bit data transfers are done in the same way, regardless of whether on a
-II board or a -IIEX board.

The host must consider two things then: 1) whether a -II or -IIEX product is
being used, and 2) whether an 8-bit or 16-bit data path is used.

A further difference is that -II boards always have a 512-byte fifo operating in
each direction. -IIEX boards may use fifos of varying size; this size is
reported as part of the power-up message.

I/O Map Of IntelliPort-II and IntelliPort-IIEX boards:
(Relative to the chosen base address)

Addr  R/W      IntelliPort-II    IntelliPort-IIEX
----  ---      --------------    ----------------
0     R/W      Data Port (byte)  Data Port (byte or word)
1     R/W      (Not used)        (MSB of word-wide data written to Data Port)
2     R        Status Register   Status Register
2     W        Pointer Register  Interrupt Mask Register
3     R/W      (Not used)        Mailbox Registers (6 bits: 11111100)
4,5   --       Reserved for future products
6     --       Reserved for future products
7     R        Guaranteed to have no effect
7     W        Hardware reset of board.


Rules:
All data transfers are performed using the even i/o address. If byte-wide data
transfers are being used, do INB/OUTB operations on the data port. If word-wide
transfers are used, do INW/OUTW operations. In some circumstances (such as
reading the power-up message) you will do INB from the data port, but in this
case the MSB of each word read is lost. When accessing all other unreserved
registers, use byte operations only.

// R/W: Data port (byte) for IntelliPort-II,
// R/W: Data port (byte or word) for IntelliPort-IIEX
// Incoming or outgoing data passes through a FIFO, the status of which is
// available in some of the bits in FIFO_STATUS. This (bidirectional) FIFO is
// the primary means of transferring data, commands, flow-control, and status
// information between the host and board.
//
#define FIFO_DATA 0

// Another way of passing information between the board and the host is
// through "mailboxes". Unlike a FIFO, a mailbox holds only a single byte of
// data.  Writing data to the mailbox causes a status bit to be set, and
// potentially interrupting the intended receiver. The sender has some way to
// determine whether the data has been read yet; as soon as it has, it may send
// more. The mailboxes are handled differently on -II and -IIEX products, as
// suggested below.
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Read: Status Register for IntelliPort-II or -IIEX
// The presence of any bit set here will cause an interrupt to the host,
// provided the corresponding bit has been unmasked in the interrupt mask
// register. Furthermore, interrupts to the host are disabled globally until the
// loadware selects the irq line to use. With the exception of STN_MR, the bits

// the outgoing mailbox may be read back: a zero indicates the board has read
// the data.
//
#define STE_OUT_MAIL 0x80  // Outbound mailbox full (!)

// The following bits are defined differently for -II and -IIEX boards. Code
// which relies on these bits will need to be functionally different for the two
// types of boards and should be generally avoided because of the additional
// complexity this creates:

// Bit map of status bits only on -II

// Fifo has been RESET (cleared when the status register is read). Note that
// this condition cannot be masked and would always interrupt the host, except
// that the hardware reset also disables interrupts globally from the board

// RESET & POWER-ON RESET MESSAGE
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESET:

The IntelliPort-II and -IIEX boards are reset in three ways: Power-up, channel
reset, and via a write to the reset register described above. For products using
the ISA bus, these three sources of reset are equvalent. For MCA and EISA buses,
the Power-up and channel reset sources cause additional hardware initialization
which should only occur at system startup time.

The third type of reset, called a "command reset", is done by writing any data
to the FIFO_RESET address described above. This resets the on-board processor,
FIFO, UARTS, and associated hardware.

This passes control of the board to the bootstrap firmware, which performs a
Power-On Self Test and which detects its current configuration. For example,
-IIEX products determine the size of FIFO which has been installed, and the
number and type of expansion boxes attached.

This and other information is then written to the FIFO in a 16-byte data block
to be read by the host. This block is guaranteed to be present within two (2)
seconds of having received the command reset. The firmware is now ready to
receive loadware from the host.

It is good practice to perform a command reset to the board explicitly as part
of your software initialization.  This allows your code to properly restart from
a soft boot. (Many systems do not issue channel reset on soft boot).

Because of a hardware reset problem on some of the Cirrus Logic 1400's which are
used on the product, it is recommended that you reset the board twice, separated
by an approximately 50 milliseconds delay. (VERY approximately: probably ok to
be off by a factor of five. The important point is that the first command reset
in fact generates a reset pulse on the board. This pulse is guaranteed to last
less than 10 milliseconds. The additional delay ensures the 1400 has had the
chance to respond sufficiently to the first reset. Why not a longer delay? Much
more than 50 milliseconds gets to be noticable, but the board would still work.

Once all 16 bytes of the Power-on Reset Message have been read, the bootstrap
firmware is ready to receive loadware.

Note on Power-on Reset Message format:
The various fields have been designed with future expansion in view.
Combinations of bitfields and values have been defined which define products
which may not currently exist. This has been done to allow drivers to anticipate
the possible introduction of products in a systematic fashion. This is not
intended to suggest that each potential product is actually under consideration.

// LOADWARE and DOWNLOADING CODE
//-------------------------------------

/*
Loadware may be sent to the board in two ways:
1) It may be read from a (binary image) data file block by block as each block
	is sent to the board. This is only possible when the initialization is
	performed by code which can access your file system. This is most suitable
	for diagnostics and appications which use the interface library directly.

2) It may be hard-coded into your source by including a .h file (typically
	supplied by Computone), which declares a data array and initializes every
	element. This achieves the same result as if an entire loadware file had 
	been read into the array.

	This requires more data space in your program, but access to the file system
	is not required. This method is more suited to driver code, which typically
	is running at a level too low to access the file system directly.

At present, loadware can only be generated at Computone.

All Loadware begins with a header area which has a particular format. This
includes a magic number which identifies the file as being (purportedly)
loadware, CRC (for the loader), and version information.
