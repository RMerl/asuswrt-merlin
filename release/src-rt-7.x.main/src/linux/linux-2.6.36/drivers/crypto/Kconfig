	select CRYPTO_BLKCIPHER
	help
	  This is the s390 hardware accelerated implementation of the
	  AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197). AES uses the Rijndael
	  algorithm.

	  Rijndael appears to be consistently a very good performer in
	  both hardware and software across a wide range of computing
	  environments regardless of its use in feedback or non-feedback
	  modes. Its key setup time is excellent, and its key agility is
	  good. Rijndael's very low memory requirements make it very well
	  suited for restricted-space environments, in which it also
	  demonstrates excellent performance. Rijndael's operations are
	  among the easiest to defend against power and timing attacks.

	  On s390 the System z9-109 currently only supports the key size
	  of 128 bit.
