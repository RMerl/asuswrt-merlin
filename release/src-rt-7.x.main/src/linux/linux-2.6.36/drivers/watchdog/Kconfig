menuconfig WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
	  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  on-line as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt> in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
	  table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

if WATCHDOG

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
	  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
	  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
	  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
	  it has been started.

config SBC_EPX_C3_WATCHDOG

	---help---
	  This is the driver for the built-in watchdog timer on the EPX-C3
	  Single-board computer made by Winsystems, Inc.

	  *Note*: This hardware watchdog is not probeable and thus there
	  is no way to know if writing to its IO address will corrupt
	  your system or have any real effect.  The only way to be sure
	  that this driver does what you want is to make sure you
	  are running it on an EPX-C3 from Winsystems with the watchdog
	  timer at IO address 0x1ee and 0x1ef.  It will write to both those
	  IO ports.  Basically, the assumption is made that if you compile
	  this driver into your kernel and/or load it as a module, that you
	  know what you are doing and that you are in fact running on an
	  EPX-C3 board!

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  Enables the watchdog for all cores running Linux. It

	  interrupt handler pokes it.  The second expiration causes an
	  NMI that prints a message. The third expiration causes a
	  global soft reset.

	  When userspace has /dev/watchdog open, no poking is done
	  from the first interrupt, it is then only poked when the
	  device is written.

	  to have watchdog support enabled, say Y, otherwise say N.

	  As a side note, saying Y here will automatically boost HZ to 1000
	  so that the timer has a chance to clear the overflow counter. On
	  slower systems (such as the SH-2 and SH-3) this will likely yield
