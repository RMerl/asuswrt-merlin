	  talk to these devices using the SCSI protocol:

	  For scanners, look at SANE (<http://www.mostang.com/sane/>). For CD
	  writer software look at Cdrtools
	  (<http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html>)

	help
	  Some devices support more than one LUN (Logical Unit Number) in order
	  to allow access to several media, e.g. CD jukebox, USB card reader,
	  mobile phone in mass storage mode. This option forces the kernel to
	  probe for all LUNs by default. This setting can be overriden by
	  max_luns boot/module parameter. Note that this option does not affect
	  devices conforming to SCSI-3 or higher as they can explicitely report
	  their number of LUNs. It is safe to say Y here unless you have one of
	  those rare devices which reacts in an unexpected way when probed for
	  multiple LUNs.

config SCSI_CONSTANTS

config SCSI_LOGGING
	bool "SCSI logging facility"
	depends on SCSI
	---help---
	  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number
	  of SCSI related problems.

	  If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you
	  can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo <bitmask> > /proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level

	  where <bitmask> is a four byte value representing the logging type
	  and logging level for each type of logging selected.

	  There are a number of logging types and you can find them in the
	  source at <file:drivers/scsi/scsi_logging.h>. The logging levels
	  are also described in that file and they determine the verbosity of
	  the logging for each logging type.

	  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI
	  problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but
	  there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have
	  logging turned off.

config SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC
	bool "Asynchronous SCSI scanning"
	depends on SCSI
	help
	  The SCSI subsystem can probe for devices while the rest of the
	  system continues booting, and even probe devices on different
	  busses in parallel, leading to a significant speed-up.

	  If you have built SCSI as modules, enabling this option can
	  be a problem as the devices may not have been found by the
	  time your system expects them to have been.  You can load the
	  scsi_wait_scan module to ensure that all scans have completed.
	  If you build your SCSI drivers into the kernel, then everything
	  will work fine if you say Y here.

	  You can override this choice by specifying "scsi_mod.scan=sync"
	  or async on the kernel's command line.

config SCSI_WAIT_SCAN
	tristate  # No prompt here, this is an invisible symbol.
	default m
	depends on SCSI
	depends on MODULES
# scsi_wait_scan is a loadable module which waits until all the async scans are
# complete.  The idea is to use it in initrd/ initramfs scripts.  You modprobe
# it after all the modprobes of the root SCSI drivers and it will wait until
# they have all finished scanning their buses before allowing the boot to
# proceed.  (This method is not applicable if targets boot independently in
# parallel with the initiator, or with transports with non-deterministic target
# discovery schemes, or if a transport driver does not support scsi_wait_scan.)
#
# This symbol is not exposed as a prompt because little is to be gained by
# disabling it, whereas people who accidentally switch it off may wonder why
# their mkinitrd gets into trouble.

	  2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and

	  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller

config IBMMCA_SCSI_ORDER_STANDARD
	bool "Standard SCSI-order"
	depends on SCSI_IBMMCA
	---help---
	  In the PC-world and in most modern SCSI-BIOS-setups, SCSI-hard disks
	  are assigned to the drive letters, starting with the lowest SCSI-id
	  (physical number -- pun) to be drive C:, as seen from DOS and
	  similar operating systems. When looking into papers describing the
	  ANSI-SCSI-standard, this assignment of drives appears to be wrong.
	  The SCSI-standard follows a hardware-hierarchy which says that id 7
	  has the highest priority and id 0 the lowest. Therefore, the host
	  adapters are still today everywhere placed as SCSI-id 7 by default.
	  In the SCSI-standard, the drive letters express the priority of the
	  disk. C: should be the hard disk, or a partition on it, with the
	  highest priority. This must therefore be the disk with the highest
	  SCSI-id (e.g. 6) and not the one with the lowest! IBM-BIOS kept the
	  original definition of the SCSI-standard as also industrial- and
	  process-control-machines, like VME-CPUs running under realtime-OSes
	  (e.g. LynxOS, OS9) do.

	  If you like to run Linux on your MCA-machine with the same
	  assignment of hard disks as seen from e.g. DOS or OS/2 on your
	  machine, which is in addition conformant to the SCSI-standard, you
	  must say Y here. This is also necessary for MCA-Linux users who want
	  to keep downward compatibility to older releases of the
	  IBM-MCA-SCSI-driver (older than driver-release 2.00 and older than
	  June 1997).

	  If you like to have the lowest SCSI-id assigned as drive C:, as
	  modern SCSI-BIOSes do, which does not conform to the standard, but
	  is widespread and common in the PC-world of today, you must say N
	  here. If unsure, say Y.

config IBMMCA_SCSI_DEV_RESET
	bool "Reset SCSI-devices at boottime"

	  By default, SCSI-devices are reset when the machine is powered on.
	  However, some devices exist, like special-control-devices,
	  SCSI-CNC-machines, SCSI-printer or scanners of older type, that do
	  not reset when switched on. If you say Y here, each device connected
	  to your SCSI-bus will be issued a reset-command after it has been
	  probed, while the kernel is booting. This may cause problems with
	  more modern devices, like hard disks, which do not appreciate these
	  reset commands, and can cause your system to hang. So say Y only if
	  you know that one of your older devices needs it; N is the safe
	  answer.

	  This is a driver for the MicroChannel Quad 720 card produced by
	  NCR and commonly used in 345x/35xx/4100 class machines.  It always

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS
	int "default tagged command queue depth"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON || SCSI_NCR_Q720
	default "8"
	---help---
	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use
	  a boot command line option for devices that need to use a different
	  command queue depth.

	  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS
	int "maximum number of queued commands"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON || SCSI_NCR_Q720
	default "32"
	---help---
	  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of commands
	  that can be queued to any device, when tagged command queuing is
	  possible. The default value is 32. Minimum is 2, maximum is 64.
	  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
	  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

	  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless
	  you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that
	  are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.

	  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC
	int "synchronous transfers frequency in MHz"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON || SCSI_NCR_Q720
	default "20"
	---help---
	  The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer
	  rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers
	  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

	  This option is only provided for safety if you suspect some SCSI
	  device of yours to not support properly the target-disconnect
	  feature. In that case, you would say Y here. In general however, to
