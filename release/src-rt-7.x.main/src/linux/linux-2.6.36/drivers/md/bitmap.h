/*
 * in-memory bitmap:
 *
 * Use 16 bit block counters to track pending writes to each "chunk".
 * The 2 high order bits are special-purpose, the first is a flag indicating
 * whether a resync is needed.  The second is a flag indicating whether a
 * resync is active.
 * This means that the counter is actually 14 bits:
 *
 * +--------+--------+------------------------------------------------+
 * | resync | resync |               counter                          |
 * | needed | active |                                                |
 * |  (0-1) |  (0-1) |              (0-16383)                         |
 * +--------+--------+------------------------------------------------+
 *
 * The "resync needed" bit is set when:
 *    a '1' bit is read from storage at startup.
 *    a write request fails on some drives
 *    a resync is aborted on a chunk with 'resync active' set
 * It is cleared (and resync-active set) when a resync starts across all drives
 * of the chunk.
 *
 *
 * The "resync active" bit is set when:
 *    a resync is started on all drives, and resync_needed is set.
 *       resync_needed will be cleared (as long as resync_active wasn't already set).
 * It is cleared when a resync completes.
 *
 * The counter counts pending write requests, plus the on-disk bit.
 * When the counter is '1' and the resync bits are clear, the on-disk
 * bit can be cleared aswell, thus setting the counter to 0.
 * When we set a bit, or in the counter (to start a write), if the fields is
 * 0, we first set the disk bit and set the counter to 1.
 *
 * If the counter is 0, the on-disk bit is clear and the stipe is clean
 * Anything that dirties the stipe pushes the counter to 2 (at least)
 * and sets the on-disk bit (lazily).
 * If a periodic sweep find the counter at 2, it is decremented to 1.
 * If the sweep find the counter at 1, the on-disk bit is cleared and the
 * counter goes to zero.
 *
 * Also, we'll hijack the "map" pointer itself and use it as two 16 bit block
 * counters as a fallback when "page" memory cannot be allocated:
 *
 * Normal case (page memory allocated):
 *
 *     page pointer (32-bit)
 *
 *     [ ] ------+
 *               |
 *               +-------> [   ][   ]..[   ] (4096 byte page == 2048 counters)
 *                          c1   c2    c2048
 *
 * Hijacked case (page memory allocation failed):
 *
 *     hijacked page pointer (32-bit)
 *
 *     [		  ][		  ] (no page memory allocated)
 *      counter #1 (16-bit) counter #2 (16-bit)
 *
