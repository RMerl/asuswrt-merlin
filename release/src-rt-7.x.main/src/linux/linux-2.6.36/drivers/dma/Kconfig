menuconfig DMADEVICES
	bool "DMA Engine support"
	depends on HAS_DMA
	help
	  DMA engines can do asynchronous data transfers without
	  involving the host CPU.  Currently, this framework can be
	  used to offload memory copies in the network stack and
	  RAID operations in the MD driver.  This menu only presents
	  DMA Device drivers supported by the configured arch, it may
	  be empty in some cases.

config DMADEVICES_DEBUG
        bool "DMA Engine debugging"
        depends on DMADEVICES != n
        help
          This is an option for use by developers; most people should
          say N here.  This enables DMA engine core and driver debugging.

config DMADEVICES_VDEBUG
        bool "DMA Engine verbose debugging"
        depends on DMADEVICES_DEBUG != n
        help
          This is an option for use by developers; most people should
          say N here.  This enables deeper (more verbose) debugging of
          the DMA engine core and drivers.
