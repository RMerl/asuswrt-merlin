/*
 * Guest memory regions (GMRs):
 *
 * This is a new memory mapping feature available in SVGA devices
 * which have the SVGA_CAP_GMR bit set. Previously, there were two
 * fixed memory regions available with which to share data between the
 * device and the driver: the FIFO ('MEM') and the framebuffer. GMRs
 * are our name for an extensible way of providing arbitrary DMA
 * buffers for use between the driver and the SVGA device. They are a
 * new alternative to framebuffer memory, usable for both 2D and 3D
 * graphics operations.
 *
 * Since GMR mapping must be done synchronously with guest CPU
 * execution, we use a new pair of SVGA registers:
 *
 *   SVGA_REG_GMR_ID --
 *
 *     Read/write.
 *     This register holds the 32-bit ID (a small positive integer)
 *     of a GMR to create, delete, or redefine. Writing this register
 *     has no side-effects.
 *
 *   SVGA_REG_GMR_DESCRIPTOR --
 *
 *     Write-only.
 *     Writing this register will create, delete, or redefine the GMR
 *     specified by the above ID register. If this register is zero,
 *     the GMR is deleted. Any pointers into this GMR (including those
 *     currently being processed by FIFO commands) will be
 *     synchronously invalidated.
 *
 *     If this register is nonzero, it must be the physical page
 *     number (PPN) of a data structure which describes the physical
 *     layout of the memory region this GMR should describe. The
 *     descriptor structure will be read synchronously by the SVGA
 *     device when this register is written. The descriptor need not
 *     remain allocated for the lifetime of the GMR.
 *
 *     The guest driver should write SVGA_REG_GMR_ID first, then
 *     SVGA_REG_GMR_DESCRIPTOR.
 *
 *   SVGA_REG_GMR_MAX_IDS --
 *
 *     Read-only.
 *     The SVGA device may choose to support a maximum number of
 *     user-defined GMR IDs. This register holds the number of supported
 *     IDs. (The maximum supported ID plus 1)
 *
 *   SVGA_REG_GMR_MAX_DESCRIPTOR_LENGTH --
 *
 *     Read-only.
 *     The SVGA device may choose to put a limit on the total number
 *     of SVGAGuestMemDescriptor structures it will read when defining
 *     a single GMR.
 *
 * The descriptor structure is an array of SVGAGuestMemDescriptor
 * structures. Each structure may do one of three things:
 *
 *   - Terminate the GMR descriptor list.
 *     (ppn==0, numPages==0)
 *
 *   - Add a PPN or range of PPNs to the GMR's virtual address space.
 *     (ppn != 0, numPages != 0)
 *
 *   - Provide the PPN of the next SVGAGuestMemDescriptor, in order to
 *     support multi-page GMR descriptor tables without forcing the
 *     driver to allocate physically contiguous memory.
 *     (ppn != 0, numPages == 0)
 *
 * Note that each physical page of SVGAGuestMemDescriptor structures
 * can describe at least 2MB of guest memory. If the driver needs to
 * use more than one page of descriptor structures, it must use one of
 * its SVGAGuestMemDescriptors to point to an additional page.  The
 * device will never automatically cross a page boundary.
 *
 * Once the driver has described a GMR, it is immediately available
 * for use via any FIFO command that uses an SVGAGuestPtr structure.
 * These pointers include a GMR identifier plus an offset into that
 * GMR.
 *
 * The driver must check the SVGA_CAP_GMR bit before using the GMR
 * registers.
 */

/*
 * Special GMR IDs, allowing SVGAGuestPtrs to point to framebuffer
 * memory as well.  In the future, these IDs could even be used to
 * allow legacy memory regions to be redefined by the guest as GMRs.
 *
 * Using the guest framebuffer (GFB) at BAR1 for general purpose DMA
 * is being phased out. Please try to use user-defined GMRs whenever
 * possible.

/*
 * FIFO Synchronization Registers
 *
 *  This explains the relationship between the various FIFO
 *  sync-related registers in IOSpace and in FIFO space.
 *
 *  SVGA_REG_SYNC --
 *
 *       The SYNC register can be used in two different ways by the guest:
 *
 *         1. If the guest wishes to fully sync (drain) the FIFO,
 *            it will write once to SYNC then poll on the BUSY
 *            register. The FIFO is sync'ed once BUSY is zero.
 *
 *         2. If the guest wants to asynchronously wake up the host,
 *            it will write once to SYNC without polling on BUSY.
 *            Ideally it will do this after some new commands have
 *            been placed in the FIFO, and after reading a zero
 *            from SVGA_FIFO_BUSY.
 *
 *       (1) is the original behaviour that SYNC was designed to
 *       support.  Originally, a write to SYNC would implicitly
 *       trigger a read from BUSY. This causes us to synchronously
 *       process the FIFO.
 *
 *       This behaviour has since been changed so that writing SYNC
 *       will *not* implicitly cause a read from BUSY. Instead, it
 *       makes a channel call which asynchronously wakes up the MKS
 *       thread.
 *
 *       New guests can use this new behaviour to implement (2)
 *       efficiently. This lets guests get the host's attention
 *       without waiting for the MKS to poll, which gives us much
 *       better CPU utilization on SMP hosts and on UP hosts while
 *       we're blocked on the host GPU.
 *
 *       Old guests shouldn't notice the behaviour change. SYNC was
 *       never guaranteed to process the entire FIFO, since it was
 *       bounded to a particular number of CPU cycles. Old guests will
 *       still loop on the BUSY register until the FIFO is empty.
 *
 *       Writing to SYNC currently has the following side-effects:
 *
 *         - Sets SVGA_REG_BUSY to TRUE (in the monitor)
 *         - Asynchronously wakes up the MKS thread for FIFO processing
 *         - The value written to SYNC is recorded as a "reason", for
 *           stats purposes.
 *
 *       If SVGA_FIFO_BUSY is available, drivers are advised to only
 *       write to SYNC if SVGA_FIFO_BUSY is FALSE. Drivers should set
 *       SVGA_FIFO_BUSY to TRUE after writing to SYNC. The MKS will
 *       eventually set SVGA_FIFO_BUSY on its own, but this approach
 *       lets the driver avoid sending multiple asynchronous wakeup
 *       messages to the MKS thread.
 *
 *  SVGA_REG_BUSY --
 *
 *       This register is set to TRUE when SVGA_REG_SYNC is written,
 *       and it reads as FALSE when the FIFO has been completely
 *       drained.
 *
 *       Every read from this register causes us to synchronously
 *       process FIFO commands. There is no guarantee as to how many
 *       commands each read will process.
 *
 *       CPU time spent processing FIFO commands will be billed to
 *       the guest.
 *
 *       New drivers should avoid using this register unless they
 *       need to guarantee that the FIFO is completely drained. It
 *       is overkill for performing a sync-to-fence. Older drivers
 *       will use this register for any type of synchronization.
 *
 *  SVGA_FIFO_BUSY --
 *
 *       This register is a fast way for the guest driver to check
 *       whether the FIFO is already being processed. It reads and
 *       writes at normal RAM speeds, with no monitor intervention.
 *
 *       If this register reads as TRUE, the host is guaranteeing that
 *       any new commands written into the FIFO will be noticed before
 *       the MKS goes back to sleep.
 *
 *       If this register reads as FALSE, no such guarantee can be
 *       made.
 *
 *       The guest should use this register to quickly determine
 *       whether or not it needs to wake up the host. If the guest
 *       just wrote a command or group of commands that it would like
 *       the host to begin processing, it should:
 *
 *         1. Read SVGA_FIFO_BUSY. If it reads as TRUE, no further
 *            action is necessary.
 *
 *         2. Write TRUE to SVGA_FIFO_BUSY. This informs future guest
 *            code that we've already sent a SYNC to the host and we
 *            don't need to send a duplicate.
 *
 *         3. Write a reason to SVGA_REG_SYNC. This will send an
 *            asynchronous wakeup to the MKS thread.

 * SVGA_CMD_DEFINE_GMRFB --

 *    This command sets a piece of SVGA device state called the

 *    piece of light-weight state which identifies the location and
 *    format of an image in guest memory or in BAR1. The GMRFB has
 *    an arbitrary size, and it doesn't need to match the geometry
 *    of the GFB or any screen object.
 *
 *    The GMRFB can be redefined as often as you like. You could
 *    always use the same GMRFB, you could redefine it before
 *    rendering from a different guest screen, or you could even
 *    redefine it before every blit.
 *
 *    There are multiple ways to use this command. The simplest way is
 *    to use it to move the framebuffer either to elsewhere in the GFB
 *    (BAR1) memory region, or to a user-defined GMR. This lets a
 *    driver use a framebuffer allocated entirely out of normal system
 *    memory, which we encourage.
 *
 *    Another way to use this command is to set up a ring buffer of
 *    updates in GFB memory. If a driver wants to ensure that no
 *    frames are skipped by the SVGA device, it is important that the
 *    driver not modify the source data for a blit until the device is
 *    done processing the command. One efficient way to accomplish
 *    this is to use a ring of small DMA buffers. Each buffer is used
 *    for one blit, then we move on to the next buffer in the
 *    ring. The FENCE mechanism is used to protect each buffer from
 *    re-use until the device is finished with that buffer's
 *    corresponding blit.
 *
 *    This command does not affect the meaning of SVGA_CMD_UPDATE.
 *    UPDATEs always occur from the legacy GFB memory area. This
 *    command has no support for pseudocolor GMRFBs. Currently only
 *    true-color 15, 16, and 24-bit depths are supported. Future
