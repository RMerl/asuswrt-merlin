	  Hardware monitoring devices let you monitor the hardware health
	  of a system. Most modern motherboards include such a device. It
	  can include temperature sensors, voltage sensors, fan speed
	  sensors and various additional features such as the ability to
	  control the speed of the fans.  If you want this support you
	  should say Y here and also to the specific driver(s) for your
	  sensors chip(s) below.

	  To find out which specific driver(s) you need, use the
	  sensors-detect script from the lm_sensors package.  Read
	  <file:Documentation/hwmon/userspace-tools> for details.

	  This support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called hwmon.
