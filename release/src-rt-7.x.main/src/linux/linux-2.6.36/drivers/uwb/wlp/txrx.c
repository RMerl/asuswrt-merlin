/*
 * Verify frame from network stack, prepare for further transmission
 *
 * @skb:   the socket buffer that needs to be prepared for transmission (it
 *         is in need of a WLP header). If this is a broadcast frame we take
 *         over the entire transmission.
 *         If it is a unicast the WSS connection should already be established
 *         and transmission will be done by the calling function.
 * @dst:   On return this will contain the device address to which the
 *         frame is destined.
 * @returns: 0 on success no tx : WLP header successfully applied to skb buffer,
 *                                calling function can proceed with tx
 *           1 on success with tx : WLP will take over transmission of this
 *                                  frame
 *           <0 on error
 *
 * The network stack (WLP client) is attempting to transmit a frame. We can
 * only transmit data if a local WSS is at least active (connection will be
 * done here if this is a broadcast frame and neighbor also has the WSS
 * active).
 *
 * The frame can be either broadcast or unicast. Broadcast in a WSS is
 * supported via multicast, but we don't support multicast yet (until
 * devices start to support MAB IEs). If a broadcast frame needs to be
 * transmitted it is treated as a unicast frame to each neighbor. In this
 * case the WLP takes over transmission of the skb and returns 1
 * to the caller to indicate so. Also, in this case, if a neighbor has the
 * same WSS activated but is not connected then the WSS connection will be
 * done at this time. The neighbor's virtual address will be learned at
 * this time.
 *
 * The destination address in a unicast frame is the virtual address of the
 * neighbor. This address only becomes known when a WSS connection is
 * established. We thus rely on a broadcast frame to trigger the setup of
 * WSS connections to all neighbors before we are able to send unicast
 * frames to them. This seems reasonable as IP would usually use ARP first
 * before any unicast frames are sent.
 *
 * If we are already connected to the neighbor (neighbor's virtual address
 * is known) we just prepare the WLP header and the caller will continue to
 * send the frame.
 *
 * A failure in this function usually indicates something that cannot be
 * fixed automatically. So, if this function fails (@return < 0) the calling
 * function should not retry to send the frame as it will very likely keep
 * failing.
