I'm hesitant to add a TODO file here, as the wireless developers would
really have people help them out on the "clean" ar9170 driver that can
be found at the linux-wireless developer site.

This driver is unmaintained and its only purpose is as a
source of documentation for developers working on ar9170 and carl9170.
Once carl9170 gets 11n support and merged upstream then this driver
can be removed.
