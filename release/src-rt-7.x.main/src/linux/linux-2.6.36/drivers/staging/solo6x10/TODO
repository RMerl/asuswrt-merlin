TODO (staging => main):

	* checkpatch.pl (haven't run it yet)
	* Lindent (should be clean, but check)
	* Motion detection flags need to be moved to v4l2
	* Some private CIDs need to be moved to v4l2

TODO (general):

	* encoder on/off controls
	* mpeg cid bitrate mode (vbr/cbr)
	* mpeg cid bitrate/bitrate-peak
	* mpeg encode of user data
	* mpeg decode of user data
	* switch between 4 frames/irq to 1 when using mjpeg (and then back
	  when not)
	* implement a CID control for motion areas/thresholds
	* implement CID controls for mozaic areas
	* allow for higher level of interval (for < 1 fps)
	* sound:
	  - implement playback via external sound jack
	  - implement loopback of external sound jack with incoming audio?
	  - implement pause/resume
	  - check into jacking sound from tx28xx chips directly (to avoid
	    g.723/8khz limitations)
