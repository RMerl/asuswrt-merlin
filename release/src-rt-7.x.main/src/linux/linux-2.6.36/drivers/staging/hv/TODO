TODO:
	- fix remaining checkpatch warnings and errors
	- audit the vmbus to verify it is working properly with the
	  driver model
	- convert vmbus driver interface function pointer tables
          to constant, a.k.a vmbus_ops
	- see if the vmbus can be merged with the other virtual busses
	  in the kernel
	- audit the network driver
	  - checking for carrier inside open is wrong, network device API
            confusion??
	- audit the block driver
	- audit the scsi driver
