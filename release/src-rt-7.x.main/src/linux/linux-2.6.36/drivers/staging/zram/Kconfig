	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

config ZRAM_STATS
	bool "Enable statistics for compressed RAM disks"
	depends on ZRAM
	default y
	help
	  Enable statistics collection for compressed RAM devices. Statistics
	  are exported through ioctl interface, so you have to use zramconfig
	  program to get them. This adds only a minimal overhead.

	  If unsure, say Y.
