* camera driver uses old V4L API

* coding style in some places is lacking

* gpio_input.c has some features matrix_keypad lacks. They should be
merged to gpio_input, with gpio_input.c removed

* pmem provides interface for userspace. Needs to be reviewed at least.

* it is probably possible to simplify touchscreen driver using threaded_irq's.

* touchscreen driver should be switched to oficial multitouch API
