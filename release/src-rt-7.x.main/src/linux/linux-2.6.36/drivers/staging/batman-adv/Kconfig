        B.A.T.M.A.N. (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) is
        a routing protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks. The
        networks may be wired or wireless. See
        http://www.open-mesh.org/ for more information and user space
        tools.

config BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG
	bool "B.A.T.M.A.N. debugging"
	depends on BATMAN_ADV != n
	---help---

	  This is an option for use by developers; most people should
	  say N here. This enables compilation of support for
	  outputting debugging information to the kernel log. The
	  output is controlled via the module parameter debug.
