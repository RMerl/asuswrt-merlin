Description:
                Indicates whether the batman protocol messages of the
                mesh <mesh_iface> shall be aggregated or not.

Description:
                Indicates whether the data traffic going through the
                mesh will be sent using multiple interfaces at the
                same time (if available).

Description:
                Defines the interval in milliseconds in which batman
                sends its protocol messages.

Description:
                Each batman node only maintains information about its
                own local neighborhood, therefore generating graphs
                showing the topology of the entire mesh is not easily
                feasible without having a central instance to collect
                the local topologies from all nodes. This file allows
                to activate the collecting (server) mode.
