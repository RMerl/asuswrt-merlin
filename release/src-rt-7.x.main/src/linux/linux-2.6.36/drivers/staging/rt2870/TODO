I'm hesitant to add a TODO file here, as the wireless developers would
really have people help them out on the "clean" rt2870 driver that can
be found at the http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/ site.

But, if you wish to clean up this driver instead, here's a short list of
things that need to be done to get it into a more mergable shape:

TODO:
	- checkpatch.pl clean
	- sparse clean
	- port to in-kernel 80211 stack and common rt2x00 infrastructure
	- remove reading from /etc/ config files
	- review by the wireless developer community

Please send any patches or complaints about this driver to Greg
Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> and don't bother the upstream wireless
kernel developers about it, they want nothing to do with it.
