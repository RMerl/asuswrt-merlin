	tristate "RAR handler driver for Intel Moorestown platform"
	depends on RAR_REGISTER
	---help---
	  This driver provides a memory management interface to
	  restricted access regions (RAR) available on the Intel
	  Moorestown platform.

	  Once locked down, restricted access regions are only
	  accessible by specific hardware on the platform.  The x86
	  CPU is typically not one of those platforms.  As such this
	  driver does not access RAR, and only provides a buffer
	  allocation/bookkeeping mechanism.

	  If unsure, say N.
