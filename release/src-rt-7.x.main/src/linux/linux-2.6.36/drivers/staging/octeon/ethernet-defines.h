/*
 * A few defines are used to control the operation of this driver:
 *  CONFIG_CAVIUM_RESERVE32
 *      This kernel config options controls the amount of memory configured
 *      in a wired TLB entry for all processes to share. If this is set, the
 *      driver will use this memory instead of kernel memory for pools. This
 *      allows 32bit userspace application to access the buffers, but also
 *      requires all received packets to be copied.
 *  CONFIG_CAVIUM_OCTEON_NUM_PACKET_BUFFERS
 *      This kernel config option allows the user to control the number of
 *      packet and work queue buffers allocated by the driver. If this is zero,
 *      the driver uses the default from below.
 *  USE_SKBUFFS_IN_HW
 *      Tells the driver to populate the packet buffers with kernel skbuffs.
 *      This allows the driver to receive packets without copying them. It also
 *      means that 32bit userspace can't access the packet buffers.
 *  USE_HW_TCPUDP_CHECKSUM
 *      Controls if the Octeon TCP/UDP checksum engine is used for packet
 *      output. If this is zero, the kernel will perform the checksum in
 *      software.
 *  USE_ASYNC_IOBDMA
 *      Use asynchronous IO access to hardware. This uses Octeon's asynchronous
 *      IOBDMAs to issue IO accesses without stalling. Set this to zero
 *      to disable this. Note that IOBDMAs require CVMSEG.
 *  REUSE_SKBUFFS_WITHOUT_FREE
 *      Allows the TX path to free an skbuff into the FPA hardware pool. This
 *      can significantly improve performance for forwarding and bridging, but
 *      may be somewhat dangerous. Checks are made, but if any buffer is reused
 *      without the proper Linux cleanup, the networking stack may have very
 *      bizarre bugs.
