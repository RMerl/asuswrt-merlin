	  If you want to use a ATA hard disk, ATA tape drive, ATA CD-ROM or
	  any other ATA device under Linux, say Y and make sure that you know
	  the name of your ATA host adapter (the card inside your computer
	  that "speaks" the ATA protocol, also called ATA controller),
	  because you will be asked for it.

	  NOTE: ATA enables basic SCSI support; *however*,

	  power management, or other areas.
	  You can disable this at kernel boot time by using the
	  option libata.noacpi=1
