	bool "SFI (Simple Firmware Interface) Support"
	---help---
	The Simple Firmware Interface (SFI) provides a lightweight method
	for platform firmware to pass information to the operating system
	via static tables in memory.  Kernel SFI support is required to
	boot on SFI-only platforms.  Currently, all SFI-only platforms are
	based on the 2nd generation Intel Atom processor platform,
	code-named Moorestown.

	For more information, see http://simplefirmware.org

	Say 'Y' here to enable the kernel to boot on SFI-only platforms.
