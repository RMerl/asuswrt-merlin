config USB_C67X00_HCD
	tristate "Cypress C67x00 HCD support"
	depends on USB
	help
	  The Cypress C67x00 (EZ-Host/EZ-OTG) chips are dual-role
	  host/peripheral/OTG USB controllers.

	  Enable this option to support this chip in host controller mode.
	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called c67x00.

config USB_XHCI_HCD
	tristate "xHCI HCD (USB 3.0) support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  The eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) is standard for USB 3.0
	  "SuperSpeed" host controller hardware.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called xhci-hcd.

config USB_XHCI_HCD_DEBUGGING
	bool "Debugging for the xHCI host controller"
	depends on USB_XHCI_HCD
	---help---
	  Say 'Y' to turn on debugging for the xHCI host controller driver.
	  This will spew debugging output, even in interrupt context.
	  This should only be used for debugging xHCI driver bugs.

	  If unsure, say N.

config USB_EHCI_HCD
	tristate "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support"
	depends on USB && USB_ARCH_HAS_EHCI
	---help---
	  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
	  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
	  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
	  configure this Host Controller Driver.

	  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
	  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
	  will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
	  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
	  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
	  Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
	  Driver too.

	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ehci-hcd.

config USB_EHCI_ROOT_HUB_TT
	bool "Root Hub Transaction Translators"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD
	---help---
	  Some EHCI chips have vendor-specific extensions to integrate
	  transaction translators, so that no OHCI or UHCI companion
	  controller is needed.  It's safe to say "y" even if your
	  controller doesn't support this feature.

	  This supports the EHCI implementation that's originally
	  from ARC, and has since changed hands a few times.

config USB_EHCI_TT_NEWSCHED
	bool "Improved Transaction Translator scheduling"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD
	default y
	---help---
	  This changes the periodic scheduling code to fill more of the low
	  and full speed bandwidth available from the Transaction Translator
	  (TT) in USB 2.0 hubs.  Without this, only one transfer will be
	  issued in each microframe, significantly reducing the number of
	  periodic low/fullspeed transfers possible.

	  If you have multiple periodic low/fullspeed devices connected to a
	  highspeed USB hub which is connected to a highspeed USB Host
	  Controller, and some of those devices will not work correctly
	  (possibly due to "ENOSPC" or "-28" errors), say Y.  Conversely, if
	  you have only one such device and it doesn't work, you could try
	  saying N.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  The OXU210HP is an USB host/OTG/device controller. Enable this
	  option if your board has this chip. If unsure, say N.

	  This driver does not support isochronous transfers and doesn't

	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  The ISP1760 chip is a USB 2.0 host controller.

	  This driver does not support isochronous transfers or OTG.
	  This USB controller is usually attached to a non-DMA-Master
	  capable bus. NXP's eval kit brings this chip on PCI card
	  where the chip itself is behind a PLB to simulate such
	  a bus.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called isp1760.

config USB_ISP1362_HCD

	select ISP1301_OMAP if MACH_OMAP_H2 || MACH_OMAP_H3
	select USB_OTG_UTILS if ARCH_OMAP
	---help---
	  The Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) is a standard for accessing
	  USB 1.1 host controller hardware.  It does more in hardware than Intel's
	  UHCI specification.  If your USB host controller follows the OHCI spec,
	  say Y.  On most non-x86 systems, and on x86 hardware that's not using a
	  USB controller from Intel or VIA, this is appropriate.  If your host
	  controller doesn't use PCI, this is probably appropriate.  For a PCI
	  based system where you're not sure, the "lspci -v" entry will list the
	  right "prog-if" for your USB controller(s):  EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ohci-hcd.

	  The Universal Host Controller Interface is a standard by Intel for
	  accessing the USB hardware in the PC (which is also called the USB
	  host controller). If your USB host controller conforms to this
	  standard, you may want to say Y, but see below. All recent boards
	  with Intel PCI chipsets (like intel 430TX, 440FX, 440LX, 440BX,
	  i810, i820) conform to this standard. Also all VIA PCI chipsets
	  (like VIA VP2, VP3, MVP3, Apollo Pro, Apollo Pro II or Apollo Pro
	  133). If unsure, say Y.

config USB_U132_HCD
	tristate "Elan U132 Adapter Host Controller"
	depends on USB && USB_FTDI_ELAN
	default M
	help
	  The U132 adapter is a USB to CardBus adapter specifically designed
	  for PC cards that contain an OHCI host controller. Typical PC cards
	  are the Orange Mobile 3G Option GlobeTrotter Fusion card. The U132
	  adapter will *NOT* work with PC cards that do not contain an OHCI
	  controller.

	  For those PC cards that contain multiple OHCI controllers only the
	  first one is used.

	  The driver consists of two modules, the "ftdi-elan" module is a
	  USB client driver that interfaces to the FTDI chip within ELAN's
	  USB-to-PCMCIA adapter, and this "u132-hcd" module is a USB host
	  controller driver that talks to the OHCI controller within the
	  CardBus cards that are inserted in the U132 adapter.

	  This driver has been tested with a CardBus OHCI USB adapter, and
	  worked with a USB PEN Drive inserted into the first USB port of
	  the PCCARD. A rather pointless thing to do, but useful for testing.

	  It is safe to say M here.
