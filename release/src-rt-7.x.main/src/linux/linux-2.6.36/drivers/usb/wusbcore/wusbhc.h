 * This driver implements parts common to all Wireless USB Host
 * Controllers (struct wusbhc, embedding a struct usb_hcd) and is used
 * by:
 *
 *   - hwahc: HWA, USB-dongle that implements a Wireless USB host
 *     controller, (Wireless USB 1.0 Host-Wire-Adapter specification).
 *
 *   - whci: WHCI, a PCI card with a wireless host controller
 *     (Wireless Host Controller Interface 1.0 specification).
 *
 * Check out the Design-overview.txt file in the source documentation
 * for other details on the implementation.
 *
 * Main blocks:
 *
 *  rh         Root Hub emulation (part of the HCD glue)
 *
 *  devconnect Handle all the issues related to device connection,
 *             authentication, disconnection, timeout, reseting,
 *             keepalives, etc.
 *
 *  mmc        MMC IE broadcasting handling
 *
 * A host controller driver just initializes its stuff and as part of
 * that, creates a 'struct wusbhc' instance that handles all the
 * common WUSB mechanisms. Links in the function ops that are specific
 * to it and then registers the host controller. Ready to run.

/**
 * WUSB Host Controller specifics
 *
 * All fields that are common to all Wireless USB controller types
 * (HWA and WHCI) are grouped here. Host Controller
 * functions/operations that only deal with general Wireless USB HC
 * issues use this data type to refer to the host.
 *
 * @usb_hcd 	   Instantiation of a USB host controller
 *                 (initialized by upper layer [HWA=HC or WHCI].
 *
 * @dev		   Device that implements this; initialized by the
 *                 upper layer (HWA-HC, WHCI...); this device should
 *                 have a refcount.
 *
 * @trust_timeout  After this time without hearing for device
 *                 activity, we consider the device gone and we have to
 *                 re-authenticate.
 *
 *                 Can be accessed w/o locking--however, read to a
 *                 local variable then use.
 *
 * @chid           WUSB Cluster Host ID: this is supposed to be a
 *                 unique value that doesn't change across reboots (so
 *                 that your devices do not require re-association).
 *
 *                 Read/Write protected by @mutex
 *
 * @dev_info       This array has ports_max elements. It is used to
 *                 give the HC information about the WUSB devices (see
 *                 'struct wusb_dev_info').
 *
 *	           For HWA we need to allocate it in heap; for WHCI it
 *                 needs to be permanently mapped, so we keep it for
 *                 both and make it easy. Call wusbhc->dev_info_set()
 *                 to update an entry.
 *
 * @ports_max	   Number of simultaneous device connections (fake
 *                 ports) this HC will take. Read-only.
 *
 * @port      	   Array of port status for each fake root port. Guaranteed to
 *                 always be the same length during device existence
 *                 [this allows for some unlocked but referenced reading].
 *
 * @mmcies_max	   Max number of Information Elements this HC can send
 *                 in its MMC. Read-only.
 *
 * @start          Start the WUSB channel.
 *
 * @stop           Stop the WUSB channel after the specified number of
 *                 milliseconds.  Channel Stop IEs should be transmitted
 *                 as required by [WUSB] 4.16.2.1.
 *
 * @mmcie_add	   HC specific operation (WHCI or HWA) for adding an
 *                 MMCIE.
 *
 * @mmcie_rm	   HC specific operation (WHCI or HWA) for removing an
 *                 MMCIE.
 *
 * @set_ptk:       Set the PTK and enable encryption for a device. Or, if
 *                 the supplied key is NULL, disable encryption for that
 *                 device.
 *
 * @set_gtk:       Set the GTK to be used for all future broadcast packets
 *                 (i.e., MMCs).  With some hardware, setting the GTK may start
 *                 MMC transmission.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *
 *  - If wusb_dev->usb_dev is not NULL, then usb_dev is valid
 *    (wusb_dev has a refcount on it). Likewise, if usb_dev->wusb_dev
 *    is not NULL, usb_dev->wusb_dev is valid (usb_dev keeps a
 *    refcount on it).
 *
 *    Most of the times when you need to use it, it will be non-NULL,
 *    so there is no real need to check for it (wusb_dev will
 *    dissapear before usb_dev).
 *
 *  - The following fields need to be filled out before calling
 *    wusbhc_create(): ports_max, mmcies_max, mmcie_{add,rm}.
 *
 *  - there is no wusbhc_init() method, we do everything in
 *    wusbhc_create().
 *
 *  - Creation is done in two phases, wusbhc_create() and
 *    wusbhc_create_b(); b are the parts that need to be called after
 *    calling usb_hcd_add(&wusbhc->usb_hcd).
