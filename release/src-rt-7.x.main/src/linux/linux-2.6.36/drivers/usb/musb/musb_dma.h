/*
 * DMA Controller Abstraction
 *
 * DMA Controllers are abstracted to allow use of a variety of different
 * implementations of DMA, as allowed by the Inventra USB cores.  On the
 * host side, usbcore sets up the DMA mappings and flushes caches; on the
 * peripheral side, the gadget controller driver does.  Responsibilities
 * of a DMA controller driver include:
 *
 *  - Handling the details of moving multiple USB packets
 *    in cooperation with the Inventra USB core, including especially
 *    the correct RX side treatment of short packets and buffer-full
 *    states (both of which terminate transfers).
 *
 *  - Knowing the correlation between dma channels and the
 *    Inventra core's local endpoint resources and data direction.
 *
 *  - Maintaining a list of allocated/available channels.
 *
 *  - Updating channel status on interrupts,
 *    whether shared with the Inventra core or separate.
