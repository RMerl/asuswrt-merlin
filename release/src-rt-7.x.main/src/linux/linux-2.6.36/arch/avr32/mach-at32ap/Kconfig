	  Define the width of the AP7000 external static memory interface.
	  This is used to determine how to mangle the address and/or data
	  when doing little-endian port access.

	  The current code can only support a single external memory bus
	  width for all chip selects, excluding the flash (which is using
	  raw access and is thus not affected by any of this.)
