	help
	  Specify the target rate the internal DAC should try to match. This
	  will use PLL1 to generate a frequency as close as possible to this
	  rate.

	  Must be within the range 32000 to 50000, which should be suitable to
	  generate most other frequencies in power of 2 steps.

	  Ex:
		48000 will also suit 24000 and 12000
		44100 will also suit 22050 and 11025
		32000 will also suit 16000 and 8000
