/*P:010
 * A hypervisor allows multiple Operating Systems to run on a single machine.
 * To quote David Wheeler: "Any problem in computer science can be solved with
 * another layer of indirection."
 *
 * We keep things simple in two ways.  First, we start with a normal Linux
 * kernel and insert a module (lg.ko) which allows us to run other Linux
 * kernels the same way we'd run processes.  We call the first kernel the Host,
 * and the others the Guests.  The program which sets up and configures Guests
 * (such as the example in Documentation/lguest/lguest.c) is called the
 * Launcher.
 *
 * Secondly, we only run specially modified Guests, not normal kernels: setting
 * CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST to "y" compiles this file into the kernel so it knows
 * how to be a Guest at boot time.  This means that you can use the same kernel
 * you boot normally (ie. as a Host) as a Guest.
 *
 * These Guests know that they cannot do privileged operations, such as disable
 * interrupts, and that they have to ask the Host to do such things explicitly.
 * This file consists of all the replacements for such low-level native
 * hardware operations: these special Guest versions call the Host.
 *
 * So how does the kernel know it's a Guest?  We'll see that later, but let's
 * just say that we end up here where we replace the native functions various
 * "paravirt" structures with our Guest versions, then boot like normal.

/*
 * Page Table Handling.
 *
 * Now would be a good time to take a rest and grab a coffee or similarly
 * relaxing stimulant.  The easy parts are behind us, and the trek gradually
 * winds uphill from here.
 *
 * Quick refresher: memory is divided into "pages" of 4096 bytes each.  The CPU
 * maps virtual addresses to physical addresses using "page tables".  We could
 * use one huge index of 1 million entries: each address is 4 bytes, so that's
 * 1024 pages just to hold the page tables.   But since most virtual addresses
 * are unused, we use a two level index which saves space.  The cr3 register
 * contains the physical address of the top level "page directory" page, which
 * contains physical addresses of up to 1024 second-level pages.  Each of these
 * second level pages contains up to 1024 physical addresses of actual pages,
 * or Page Table Entries (PTEs).
 *
 * Here's a diagram, where arrows indicate physical addresses:
 *
 * cr3 ---> +---------+
 *	    |  	   --------->+---------+
 *	    |	      |	     | PADDR1  |
 *	  Mid-level   |	     | PADDR2  |
 *	  (PMD) page  |	     | 	       |
 *	    |	      |	   Lower-level |
 *	    |	      |	   (PTE) page  |
 *	    |	      |	     |	       |
 *	      ....    	     	 ....
 *
 * So to convert a virtual address to a physical address, we look up the top
 * level, which points us to the second level, which gives us the physical
 * address of that page.  If the top level entry was not present, or the second
 * level entry was not present, then the virtual address is invalid (we
 * say "the page was not mapped").
 *
 * Put another way, a 32-bit virtual address is divided up like so:
 *
 *  1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 * |<---- 10 bits ---->|<---- 10 bits ---->|<------ 12 bits ------>|
 *    Index into top     Index into second      Offset within page
 *  page directory page    pagetable page
 *
 * Now, unfortunately, this isn't the whole story: Intel added Physical Address
 * Extension (PAE) to allow 32 bit systems to use 64GB of memory (ie. 36 bits).
 * These are held in 64-bit page table entries, so we can now only fit 512
 * entries in a page, and the neat three-level tree breaks down.
 *
 * The result is a four level page table:
 *
 * cr3 --> [ 4 Upper  ]
 *	   [   Level  ]
 *	   [  Entries ]
 *	   [(PUD Page)]---> +---------+
 *	 		    |  	   --------->+---------+
 *	 		    |	      |	     | PADDR1  |
 *	 		  Mid-level   |	     | PADDR2  |
 *	 		  (PMD) page  |	     | 	       |
 *	 		    |	      |	   Lower-level |
 *	 		    |	      |	   (PTE) page  |
 *	 		    |	      |	     |	       |
 *	 		      ....    	     	 ....
 *
 *
 * And the virtual address is decoded as:
 *
 *         1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 *      |<-2->|<--- 9 bits ---->|<---- 9 bits --->|<------ 12 bits ------>|
 * Index into    Index into mid    Index into lower    Offset within page
 * top entries   directory page     pagetable page
 *
 * It's too hard to switch between these two formats at runtime, so Linux only
 * supports one or the other depending on whether CONFIG_X86_PAE is set.  Many
 * distributions turn it on, and not just for people with silly amounts of
 * memory: the larger PTE entries allow room for the NX bit, which lets the
 * kernel disable execution of pages and increase security.
 *
 * This was a problem for lguest, which couldn't run on these distributions;
 * then Matias Zabaljauregui figured it all out and implemented it, and only a
 * handful of puppies were crushed in the process!
 *
 * Back to our point: the kernel spends a lot of time changing both the
 * top-level page directory and lower-level pagetable pages.  The Guest doesn't
 * know physical addresses, so while it maintains these page tables exactly
 * like normal, it also needs to keep the Host informed whenever it makes a
