	  Xtensa processors are 32-bit RISC machines designed by Tensilica
	  primarily for embedded systems.  These processors are both
	  configurable and extensible.  The Linux port to the Xtensa
	  architecture supports all processor configurations and extensions,
	  with reasonable minimum requirements.  The Xtensa Linux project has
	  a home page at <http://xtensa.sourceforge.net/>.

	bool "Unaligned memory access in use space"
	help
	  The Xtensa architecture currently does not handle unaligned
	  memory accesses in hardware but through an exception handler.
	  Per default, unaligned memory accesses are disabled in user space.

	  Say Y here to enable unaligned memory access in user space.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	help
          This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
          real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
          be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
          Unfortunately the kernel code has some race conditions if both
          CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT are enabled, so this option is
          currently disabled if you are building an SMP kernel.

          Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
          or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config XTENSA_CALIBRATE_CCOUNT

	help
	  On some platforms (XT2000, for example), the CPU clock rate can

	  against a well known, fixed frequency, such as an UART oscillator.

	  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
	  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

	help
	  On some architectures (EBSA110 and CATS), there is currently no way
	  for the boot loader to pass arguments to the kernel. For these
	  architectures, you should supply some command-line options at build
	  time by entering them here. As a minimum, you should specify the
	  memory size and the root device (e.g., mem=64M root=/dev/nfs).

config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
	  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
	  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

	  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	  Enable HOTPLUG and build a modular kernel.  Get agent software
	  (from <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	  to use devices as you hotplug them.

          If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
          /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image in ELF format. This
          can be used in gdb:

          $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore

          This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
          "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
	  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel.
