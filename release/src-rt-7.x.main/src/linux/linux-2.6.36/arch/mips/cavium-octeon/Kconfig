	bool "Build the kernel to be used as a 2nd kernel on the same chip"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS
	default "n"
	help
	  This option configures this kernel to be linked at a different
	  address and use the 2nd uart for output. This allows a kernel built
	  with this option to be run at the same time as one built without this
	  option.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_HW_FIX_UNALIGNED
	bool "Enable hardware fixups of unaligned loads and stores"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS
	default "y"
	help
	  Configure the Octeon hardware to automatically fix unaligned loads
	  and stores. Normally unaligned accesses are fixed using a kernel
	  exception handler. This option enables the hardware automatic fixups,
	  which requires only an extra 3 cycles. Disable this option if you
	  are running code that relies on address exceptions on unaligned
	  accesses.

	int "Number of L1 cache lines reserved for CVMSEG memory"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS
	range 0 54
	default 1
	help
	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache as a
	  local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the cache is.
	  This selects the size of CVMSEG LM, which is in cache blocks. The
	  legally range is from zero to 54 cache blocks (i.e. CVMSEG LM is
	  between zero and 6192 bytes).

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2

	  Enable locking parts of the kernel into the L2 cache.
