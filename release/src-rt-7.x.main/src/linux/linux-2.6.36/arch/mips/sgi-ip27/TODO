1. Need to figure out why PCI writes to the IOC3 hang, and if it is okay
not to write to the IOC3 ever.
2. Need to figure out RRB allocation in bridge_startup().
3. Need to figure out why address swaizzling is needed in inw/outw for
Qlogic scsi controllers.
4. Need to integrate ip27-klconfig.c:find_lboard and
ip27-init.c:find_lbaord_real. DONE
5. Is it okay to set calias space on all nodes as 0, instead of 8k as
in irix?
6. Investigate why things do not work without the setup_test() call
being invoked on all nodes in ip27-memory.c.
8. Too many do_page_faults invoked - investigate.
9. start_thread must turn off UX64 ... and define tlb_refill_debug.
10. Need a bad pmd table, bad pte table. __bad_pmd_table/__bad_pagetable
does not agree with pgd_bad/pmd_bad.
11. All intrs (ip27_do_irq handlers) are targetted at cpu A on the node.
This might need to change later. Only the timer intr is set up to be
received on both Cpu A and B. (ip27_do_irq()/bridge_startup())
13. Cache flushing (specially the SMP version) has to be investigated.
