config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Check for stack overflows"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  This option will cause messages to be printed if free stack space
	  drops below a certain limit.

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.

config DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
	bool "Debug page memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && BROKEN
	help
	  Unmap pages from the kernel linear mapping after free_pages().
	  This results in a large slowdown, but helps to find certain types
	  of memory corruptions.

config FRAME_POINTER
	bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger
	  and slower, but it will give very useful debugging information.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able
	  to solve problems without frame pointers.
