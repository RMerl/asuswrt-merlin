This is a board-level BSP directory.

The code here needs to cover these aspects:

+ Type and mapping for Flash memories, and how they are partitioned.
+ Tie-up with the boot-loader, e.g. u-Boot vs. CFE loader interface.
+ The means to access and share NVRAM or environment settings with th eloader.
+ The frequency of the oscilator or crystal, unless the SoC has
  straps allowing automatic detection of that frequency.
+ The assignments of multi-function I/O pins on the SoC.
+ Any ICs that are external to the main SoC that are not handler
  by auto-detecting (such as PCI/PCIe connected peripherals),
  including those connected with I2C.
+ Any other aspect of the SoC that can differ in board-level implementation.

All other aspects of the BSP are handled in the Platform directory.
