This directory provides support to select ARM-based SoC from Broadcom.

The code in this directory is pertinent to the contents of each SoC, 
who all have the i-proc and i-host cores in common.
This directory also provides the binding information 
(i.e. base address and IRQ#) for all the peripherals contained in the SoC.

All board-level support is in "mach-brcm-*'.
