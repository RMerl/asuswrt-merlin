/*
 * This is our kernel timer structure.
 *
 * - init
 *   Initialise the kernels jiffy timer source, claim interrupt
 *   using setup_irq.  This is called early on during initialisation
 *   while interrupts are still disabled on the local CPU.
 * - suspend
 *   Suspend the kernel jiffy timer source, if necessary.  This
 *   is called with interrupts disabled, after all normal devices
 *   have been suspended.  If no action is required, set this to
 *   NULL.
 * - resume
 *   Resume the kernel jiffy timer source, if necessary.  This
 *   is called with interrupts disabled before any normal devices
 *   are resumed.  If no action is required, set this to NULL.
 * - offset
 *   Return the timer offset in microseconds since the last timer
 *   interrupt.  Note: this must take account of any unprocessed
 *   timer interrupt which may be pending.
