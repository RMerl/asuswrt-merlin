/*
 *	build IOMUX_PAD structure
 *
 * This iomux scheme is based around pads, which are the physical balls
 * on the processor.
 *
 * - Each pad has a pad control register (IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTRL_x) which controls
 *   things like driving strength and pullup/pulldown.
 * - Each pad can have but not necessarily does have an output routing register
 *   (IOMUXC_SW_MUX_CTL_PAD_x).
 * - Each pad can have but not necessarily does have an input routing register
 *   (IOMUXC_x_SELECT_INPUT)
 *
 * The three register sets do not have a fixed offset to each other,
 * hence we order this table by pad control registers (which all pads
 * have) and put the optional i/o routing registers into additional
 * fields.
 *
 * The naming convention for the pad modes is MX35_PAD_<padname>__<padmode>
 * If <padname> or <padmode> refers to a GPIO, it is named
 * GPIO_<unit>_<num>
 *
