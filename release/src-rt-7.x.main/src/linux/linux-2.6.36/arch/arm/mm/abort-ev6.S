 * Function: v6_early_abort
 *
 * Params  : r2 = address of aborted instruction
 *         : r3 = saved SPSR
 *
 * Returns : r0 = address of abort
 *	   : r1 = FSR, bit 11 = write
 *	   : r2-r8 = corrupted
 *	   : r9 = preserved
 *	   : sp = pointer to registers
 *
 * Purpose : obtain information about current aborted instruction.
 * Note: we read user space.  This means we might cause a data
 * abort here if the I-TLB and D-TLB aren't seeing the same
 * picture.  Unfortunately, this does happen.  We live with it.
