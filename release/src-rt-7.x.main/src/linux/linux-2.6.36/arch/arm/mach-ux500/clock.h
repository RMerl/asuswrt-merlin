/**
 * struct clk - ux500 clock structure
 * @ops:		pointer to clkops struct used to control this clock
 * @name:		name, for debugging
 * @enabled:		refcount. positive if enabled, zero if disabled
 * @get_rate:		custom callback for getting the clock rate
 * @data:		custom per-clock data for example for the get_rate
 *			callback
 * @rate:		fixed rate for clocks which don't implement
 * 			ops->getrate
 * @prcmu_cg_off:	address offset of the combined enable/disable register
 * 			(used on u8500v1)
 * @prcmu_cg_bit:	bit in the combined enable/disable register (used on
 * 			u8500v1)
 * @prcmu_cg_mgt:	address of the enable/disable register (used on
 * 			u8500ed)
 * @cluster:		peripheral cluster number
 * @prcc_bus:		bit for the bus clock in the peripheral's CLKRST
 * @prcc_kernel:	bit for the kernel clock in the peripheral's CLKRST.
 * 			-1 if no kernel clock exists.
 * @parent_cluster:	pointer to parent's cluster clk struct
 * @parent_periph:	pointer to parent's peripheral clk struct
 *
 * Peripherals are organised into clusters, and each cluster has an associated
 * bus clock.  Some peripherals also have a parent peripheral clock.
 *
 * In order to enable a clock for a peripheral, we need to enable:
 * 	(1) the parent cluster (bus) clock at the PRCMU level
 * 	(2) the parent peripheral clock (if any) at the PRCMU level
 * 	(3) the peripheral's bus & kernel clock at the PRCC level
 *
 * (1) and (2) are handled by defining clk structs (DEFINE_PRCMU_CLK) for each
 * of the cluster and peripheral clocks, and hooking these as the parents of
 * the individual peripheral clocks.
 *
 * (3) is handled by specifying the bits in the PRCC control registers required
 * to enable these clocks and modifying them in the ->enable and
 * ->disable callbacks of the peripheral clocks (DEFINE_PRCC_CLK).
 *
 * This structure describes both the PRCMU-level clocks and PRCC-level clocks.
 * The prcmu_* fields are only used for the PRCMU clocks, and the cluster,
 * prcc, and parent pointers are only used for the PRCC-level clocks.
