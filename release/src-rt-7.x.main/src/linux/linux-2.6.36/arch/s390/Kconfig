config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  See also the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Even if you don't know what to do here, say Y.

	range 2 64
	depends on SMP
	default "32" if !64BIT
	default "64" if 64BIT
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
	  kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 64 and the
	  minimum value which makes sense is 2.

	  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU adds
	  approximately sixteen kilobytes to the kernel image.

config HOTPLUG_CPU
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable CPUs"
	depends on SMP
	select HOTPLUG
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to be able to turn CPUs off and on. CPUs
	  can be controlled through /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#.

	  need this.

config COMPAT
	bool "Kernel support for 31 bit emulation"
	depends on 64BIT
	select COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable your system kernel to
	  handle system-calls from ELF binaries for 31 bit ESA.  This option
	  (and some other stuff like libraries and such) is needed for
	  executing 31 bit applications.  It is safe to say "Y".

	help
	  This option allows to enable a buffer overflow protection for user

	  The kernel parameter noexec=on will enable this feature and also
	  switch the addressing modes, default is disabled. Enabling this (via
	  kernel parameter) on machines earlier than IBM System z9-109 EC/BC
	  will reduce system performance.

	  Select this enable optimizations for model z890/z990.
	  This will be slightly faster but does not work on
	  older machines such as the z900.

config MARCH_Z9_109

	help
	  Select this to enable optimizations for IBM System z9-109, IBM
	  System z9 Enterprise Class (z9 EC), and IBM System z9 Business
	  Class (z9 BC). The kernel will be slightly faster but will not
	  work on older machines such as the z990, z890, z900, and z800.

config MARCH_Z10

config PACK_STACK
	bool "Pack kernel stack"
	help
	  This option enables the compiler option -mkernel-backchain if it
	  is available. If the option is available the compiler supports
	  the new stack layout which dramatically reduces the minimum stack
	  frame size. With an old compiler a non-leaf function needs a
	  minimum of 96 bytes on 31 bit and 160 bytes on 64 bit. With
	  -mkernel-backchain the minimum size drops to 16 byte on 31 bit
	  and 24 byte on 64 bit.

	  Say Y if you are unsure.

config SMALL_STACK
	bool "Use 8kb for kernel stack instead of 16kb"
	depends on PACK_STACK && 64BIT && !LOCKDEP
	help
	  If you say Y here and the compiler supports the -mkernel-backchain
	  option the kernel will use a smaller kernel stack size. The reduced
	  size is 8kb instead of 16kb. This allows to run more threads on a
	  system and reduces the pressure on the memory management for higher
	  order page allocations.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config CHECK_STACK
	bool "Detect kernel stack overflow"
	help
	  This option enables the compiler option -mstack-guard and
	  -mstack-size if they are available. If the compiler supports them
	  it will emit additional code to each function prolog to trigger
	  an illegal operation if the kernel stack is about to overflow.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config STACK_GUARD
	int "Size of the guard area (128-1024)"
	range 128 1024
	depends on CHECK_STACK
	default "256"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the size of the guard area at the lower
	  end of the kernel stack. If the kernel stack points into the guard
	  area on function entry an illegal operation is triggered. The size
	  needs to be a power of 2. Please keep in mind that the size of an
	  interrupt frame is 184 bytes for 31 bit and 328 bytes on 64 bit.
	  The minimum size for the stack guard should be 256 for 31 bit and
	  512 for 64 bit.

config WARN_STACK
	bool "Emit compiler warnings for function with broken stack usage"
	help
	  This option enables the compiler options -mwarn-framesize and
	  -mwarn-dynamicstack. If the compiler supports these options it
	  will generate warnings for function which either use alloca or
	  create a stack frame bigger than CONFIG_WARN_STACK_SIZE.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config WARN_STACK_SIZE
	int "Maximum frame size considered safe (128-2048)"
	range 128 2048
	depends on WARN_STACK
	default "2048"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum frame size a function may
	  have without the compiler complaining about it.

	  module will be called qdio.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CHSC_SCH
	tristate "Support for CHSC subchannels"
	help
	  This driver allows usage of CHSC subchannels. A CHSC subchannel
	  is usually present on LPAR only.
	  The driver creates a device /dev/chsc, which may be used to
	  obtain I/O configuration information about the machine and
	  to issue asynchronous chsc commands (DANGEROUS).
	  You will usually only want to use this interface on a special
	  LPAR designated for system management.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called chsc_sch.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PFAULT
	bool "Pseudo page fault support"
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to use PFAULT pseudo page fault
	  handling under VM. If running native or in LPAR, this option
	  has no effect. If your VM does not support PFAULT, PAGEEX
	  pseudo page fault handling will be used.
	  Note that VM 4.2 supports PFAULT but has a bug in its
	  implementation that causes some problems.
	  Everybody who wants to run Linux under VM != VM4.2 should select
	  this option.

config SHARED_KERNEL
	bool "VM shared kernel support"
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to share the text segment of the
	  Linux kernel between different VM guests. This reduces memory
	  usage with lots of guests but greatly increases kernel size.
	  Also if a kernel was IPL'ed from a shared segment the kexec system
	  call will not work.
	  You should only select this option if you know what you are
	  doing and want to exploit this feature.

config CMM
	tristate "Cooperative memory management"
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to enable the kernel interface
	  to reduce the memory size of the system. This is accomplished
	  by allocating pages of memory and put them "on hold". This only
	  makes sense for a system running under VM where the unused pages
	  will be reused by VM for other guest systems. The interface
	  allows an external monitor to balance memory of many systems.
	  Everybody who wants to run Linux under VM should select this
	  option.

config CMM_IUCV
	bool "IUCV special message interface to cooperative memory management"
	depends on CMM && (SMSGIUCV=y || CMM=SMSGIUCV)
	help
	  Select this option to enable the special message interface to
	  the cooperative memory management.

config APPLDATA_BASE
	bool "Linux - VM Monitor Stream, base infrastructure"
	depends on PROC_FS
	help
	  This provides a kernel interface for creating and updating z/VM APPLDATA
	  monitor records. The monitor records are updated at certain time
	  intervals, once the timer is started.
	  Writing 1 or 0 to /proc/appldata/timer starts(1) or stops(0) the timer,
	  i.e. enables or disables monitoring on the Linux side.
	  A custom interval value (in seconds) can be written to
	  /proc/appldata/interval.

	  Defaults are 60 seconds interval and timer off.
	  The /proc entries can also be read from, showing the current settings.

config APPLDATA_MEM
	tristate "Monitor memory management statistics"
	depends on APPLDATA_BASE && VM_EVENT_COUNTERS
	help
	  This provides memory management related data to the Linux - VM Monitor
	  Stream, like paging/swapping rate, memory utilisation, etc.
	  Writing 1 or 0 to /proc/appldata/memory creates(1) or removes(0) a z/VM
	  APPLDATA monitor record, i.e. enables or disables monitoring this record
	  on the z/VM side.

	  Default is disabled.
	  The /proc entry can also be read from, showing the current settings.

	  This can also be compiled as a module, which will be called
	  appldata_mem.o.

config APPLDATA_OS
	tristate "Monitor OS statistics"
	depends on APPLDATA_BASE
	help
	  This provides OS related data to the Linux - VM Monitor Stream, like
	  CPU utilisation, etc.
	  Writing 1 or 0 to /proc/appldata/os creates(1) or removes(0) a z/VM
	  APPLDATA monitor record, i.e. enables or disables monitoring this record
	  on the z/VM side.

	  Default is disabled.
	  This can also be compiled as a module, which will be called
	  appldata_os.o.

config APPLDATA_NET_SUM
	tristate "Monitor overall network statistics"
	depends on APPLDATA_BASE && NET
	help
	  This provides network related data to the Linux - VM Monitor Stream,
	  currently there is only a total sum of network I/O statistics, no
	  per-interface data.
	  Writing 1 or 0 to /proc/appldata/net_sum creates(1) or removes(0) a z/VM
	  APPLDATA monitor record, i.e. enables or disables monitoring this record
	  on the z/VM side.

	  Default is disabled.
	  This can also be compiled as a module, which will be called

	help
	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.
