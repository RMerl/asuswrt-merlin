 * (though it would work if some processors had less threads as long
 * as the CPU numbers are still allocated, just not brought offline).
 *
 * However, the API allows for a different implementation in the future
 * if needed, as long as you only use the functions and not the variables
 * directly.

 * This can typically be used for things like IPI for tlb invalidations
