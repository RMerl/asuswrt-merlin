   faulting instruction, which means the branch-target for instructions in
   delay-slots for taken branches.  Note also that the postincrement in
   the instruction is performed regardless of bus-fault; the register is
   seen updated in fault handlers.

   it" to Conformity: I'm too "lazy", but why don't you go ahead and "fix"
