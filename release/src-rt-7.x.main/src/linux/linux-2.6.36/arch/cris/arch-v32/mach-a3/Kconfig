	  Configures the direction of general port A bits.  1 is out, 0 is in.
	  This is often totally different depending on the product used.
	  There are some guidelines though - if you know that only LED's are
	  connected to port PA, then they are usually connected to bits 2-4
	  and you can therefore use 1c.  On other boards which don't have the
	  LED's at the general ports, these bits are used for all kinds of
	  stuff.  If you don't know what to use, it is always safe to put all
	  as inputs, although floating inputs isn't good.
