	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to remotely debug the kernel
	  using gdb. This enlarges your kernel ELF image disk size by several
	  megabytes and requires a machine with more than 16 MB, better 32 MB
	  RAM to avoid excessive linking time. This is only useful for kernel
	  hackers. If unsure, say N.

	  If you say Y here, GDB stub will break into the program as soon as
	  possible, leaving the program counter at the beginning of
	  start_kernel() in init/main.c.

config GDB_CONSOLE
	bool "Console output to GDB"
	depends on GDBSTUB
	help
	  If you are using GDB for remote debugging over a serial port and
	  would like kernel messages to be formatted into GDB $O packets so
	  that GDB prints them as program output, say 'Y'.
