config OPROFILE
	tristate "OProfile system profiling"
	depends on PROFILING
	depends on HAVE_OPROFILE
	select RING_BUFFER
	select RING_BUFFER_ALLOW_SWAP
	help
	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
	  and applications.

	  If unsure, say N.

config OPROFILE_EVENT_MULTIPLEX
	bool "OProfile multiplexing support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default n
	depends on OPROFILE && X86
	help
	  The number of hardware counters is limited. The multiplexing
	  feature enables OProfile to gather more events than counters
	  are provided by the hardware. This is realized by switching
	  between events at an user specified time interval.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HAVE_OPROFILE
	bool

config KPROBES
	bool "Kprobes"
	depends on MODULES
	depends on HAVE_KPROBES
	select KALLSYMS
	help
	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
	  execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
	  a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
	  for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config OPTPROBES
	def_bool y
	depends on KPROBES && HAVE_OPTPROBES
	depends on !PREEMPT

config HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
	bool
	help
	  Some architectures are unable to perform unaligned accesses
	  without the use of get_unaligned/put_unaligned. Others are
	  unable to perform such accesses efficiently (e.g. trap on
	  unaligned access and require fixing it up in the exception
	  handler.)

	  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if it can
	  perform unaligned accesses efficiently to allow different
	  code paths to be selected for these cases. Some network
	  drivers, for example, could opt to not fix up alignment
	  problems with received packets if doing so would not help
	  much.

	  See Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt for more
	  information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.

config HAVE_SYSCALL_WRAPPERS
	bool

config KRETPROBES
	def_bool y
	depends on KPROBES && HAVE_KRETPROBES

config USER_RETURN_NOTIFIER
	bool
	depends on HAVE_USER_RETURN_NOTIFIER
	help
	  Provide a kernel-internal notification when a cpu is about to
	  switch to user mode.

config HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT
	bool

config HAVE_KPROBES
	bool

config HAVE_KRETPROBES
	bool

config HAVE_OPTPROBES
	bool
#
# An arch should select this if it provides all these things:
#
#	task_pt_regs()		in asm/processor.h or asm/ptrace.h
#	arch_has_single_step()	if there is hardware single-step support
#	arch_has_block_step()	if there is hardware block-step support
#	asm/syscall.h		supplying asm-generic/syscall.h interface
#	linux/regset.h		user_regset interfaces
#	CORE_DUMP_USE_REGSET	#define'd in linux/elf.h
#	TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE	calls tracehook_report_syscall_{entry,exit}
#	TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME	calls tracehook_notify_resume()
#	signal delivery		calls tracehook_signal_handler()
#
config HAVE_ARCH_TRACEHOOK
	bool

config HAVE_DMA_ATTRS
	bool

config USE_GENERIC_SMP_HELPERS
	bool

config HAVE_REGS_AND_STACK_ACCESS_API
	bool
	help
	  This symbol should be selected by an architecure if it supports
	  the API needed to access registers and stack entries from pt_regs,
	  declared in asm/ptrace.h
	  For example the kprobes-based event tracer needs this API.

config HAVE_CLK
	bool
	help
	  The <linux/clk.h> calls support software clock gating and
	  thus are a key power management tool on many systems.

config HAVE_DMA_API_DEBUG
	bool

config HAVE_DEFAULT_NO_SPIN_MUTEXES
	bool

config HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT
	bool
	depends on PERF_EVENTS

config HAVE_MIXED_BREAKPOINTS_REGS
	bool
	depends on HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT
	help
	  Depending on the arch implementation of hardware breakpoints,
	  some of them have separate registers for data and instruction
	  breakpoints addresses, others have mixed registers to store
	  them but define the access type in a control register.
	  Select this option if your arch implements breakpoints under the
	  latter fashion.

config HAVE_USER_RETURN_NOTIFIER
	bool

config HAVE_PERF_EVENTS_NMI
	bool
	help
	  System hardware can generate an NMI using the perf event
	  subsystem.  Also has support for calculating CPU cycle events
	  to determine how many clock cycles in a given period.
