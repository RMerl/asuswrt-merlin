This document describes the ALi m5602 bridge connected
to the following supported sensors:
OmniVision OV9650,
Samsung s5k83a,
Samsung s5k4aa,
Micron mt9m111,
Pixel plus PO1030

This driver mimics the windows drivers, which have a braindead implementation sending bayer-encoded frames at VGA resolution.
In a perfect world we should be able to reprogram the m5602 and the connected sensor in hardware instead, supporting a range of resolutions and pixelformats

Anyway, have fun and please report any bugs to m560x-driver-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
