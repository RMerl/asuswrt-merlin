Numa policy hit/miss statistics

/sys/devices/system/node/node*/numastat

All units are pages. Hugepages have separate counters.

numa_hit			A process wanted to allocate memory from this node,
					and succeeded.
numa_miss			A process wanted to allocate memory from another node,
					but ended up with memory from this node.
numa_foreign		A process wanted to allocate on this node,
				    but ended up with memory from another one.
local_node			A process ran on this node and got memory from it.
other_node			A process ran on this node and got memory from another node.
interleave_hit 		Interleaving wanted to allocate from this node
					and succeeded.

For easier reading you can use the numastat utility from the numactl package
(ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/ak/numa/numactl*). Note that it only works
well right now on machines with a small number of CPUs.
