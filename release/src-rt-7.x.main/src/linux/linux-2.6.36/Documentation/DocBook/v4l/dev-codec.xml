    <title>Suspended</title>

    <para>This interface has been be suspended from the V4L2 API
implemented in Linux 2.6 until we have more experience with codec
device interfaces.</para>
  </note>

  <para>A V4L2 codec can compress, decompress, transform, or otherwise
convert video data from one format into another format, in memory.
Applications send data to be converted to the driver through a
&func-write; call, and receive the converted data through a
&func-read; call. For efficiency a driver may also support streaming
I/O.</para>
