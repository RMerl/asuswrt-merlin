	<para>This section describes shortly what are the possible parameters in the Linux
		DVB-API called "S2API" and now DVB API 5 in order to tune an ISDB-T/ISDB-Tsb
		demodulator:</para>

	<para>This ISDB-T/ISDB-Tsb API extension should reflect all information
		needed to tune any ISDB-T/ISDB-Tsb hardware. Of course it is possible
		that some very sophisticated devices won't need certain parameters to
		tune.</para>

	<para>The information given here should help application writers to know how
		to handle ISDB-T and ISDB-Tsb hardware using the Linux DVB-API.</para>

	<para>The details given here about ISDB-T and ISDB-Tsb are just enough to
		basically show the dependencies between the needed parameter values,
		but surely some information is left out. For more detailed information
		see the following documents:</para>

	<para>ARIB STD-B31 - "Transmission System for Digital Terrestrial
		Television Broadcasting" and</para>
	<para>ARIB TR-B14 - "Operational Guidelines for Digital Terrestrial
		Television Broadcasting".</para>

	<para>In order to read this document one has to have some knowledge the
		channel structure in ISDB-T and ISDB-Tsb. I.e. it has to be known to
		the reader that an ISDB-T channel consists of 13 segments, that it can
		have up to 3 layer sharing those segments, and things like that.</para>

			<para>For ISDB-T the channels are usally transmitted with an offset of 143kHz. E.g. a
				valid frequncy could be 474143 kHz. The stepping is bound to the bandwidth of
				the channel which is 6MHz.</para>

			<para>As in ISDB-Tsb the channel consists of only one or three segments the
				frequency step is 429kHz, 3*429 respectively. As for ISDB-T the
				central frequency of the channel is expected.</para>

			<para>(Note of the author: This might not be the correct description of the
				<constant>SUBCHANNEL-ID</constant> in all details, but it is my understanding of the technical
				background needed to program a device)</para>

			<para>An ISDB-Tsb channel (1 or 3 segments) can be broadcasted alone or in a
				set of connected ISDB-Tsb channels. In this set of channels every
				channel can be received independently. The number of connected
				ISDB-Tsb segment can vary, e.g. depending on the frequency spectrum
				bandwidth available.</para>

			<para>Example: Assume 8 ISDB-Tsb connected segments are broadcasted. The
				broadcaster has several possibilities to put those channels in the
				air: Assuming a normal 13-segment ISDB-T spectrum he can align the 8
				segments from position 1-8 to 5-13 or anything in between.</para>

			<para>The underlying layer of segments are subchannels: each segment is
				consisting of several subchannels with a predefined IDs. A sub-channel
				is used to help the demodulator to synchronize on the channel.</para>

			<para>An ISDB-T channel is always centered over all sub-channels. As for
				the example above, in ISDB-Tsb it is no longer as simple as that.</para>

			<para><constant>The DTV_ISDBT_SB_SUBCHANNEL_ID</constant> parameter is used to give the

			<title>Hierarchical layers</title>

			<para>ISDB-T channels can be coded hierarchically. As opposed to DVB-T in
				ISDB-T hierarchical layers can be decoded simultaneously. For that
				reason a ISDB-T demodulator has 3 viterbi and 3 reed-solomon-decoders.</para>

			<para>ISDB-T has 3 hierarchical layers which each can use a part of the
				available segments. The total number of segments over all layers has
				to 13 in ISDB-T.</para>

			<section id="isdbt-layer-ena">
				<title><constant>DTV_ISDBT_LAYER_ENABLED</constant></title>

				<para>Hierarchical reception in ISDB-T is achieved by enabling or disabling
					layers in the decoding process. Setting all bits of
					<constant>DTV_ISDBT_LAYER_ENABLED</constant> to '1' forces all layers (if applicable) to be
					demodulated. This is the default.</para>

				<para>If the channel is in the partial reception mode
					(<constant>DTV_ISDBT_PARTIAL_RECEPTION</constant> = 1) the central segment can be decoded
					independently of the other 12 segments. In that mode layer A has to
					have a <constant>SEGMENT_COUNT</constant> of 1.</para>

				<para>In ISDB-Tsb only layer A is used, it can be 1 or 3 in ISDB-Tsb
