		This file is writeable and can be used to set the current
		coloumb counter value inside the battery monitor chip. This
		is needed for unavoidable corrections of aging batteries.
		A userspace daemon can monitor the battery charging logic
		and once the counter drops out of considerable bounds, take
		appropriate action.
