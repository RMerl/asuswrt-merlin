Description:
		The /sys/firmware/sgi_uv directory contains information
		about the SGI UV platform.

		Under that directory are a number of files:

			partition_id
			coherence_id

		The partition_id entry contains the partition id.
		SGI UV systems can be partitioned into multiple physical
		machines, which each partition running a unique copy
		of the operating system.  Each partition will have a unique
		partition id.  To display the partition id, use the command:

			cat /sys/firmware/sgi_uv/partition_id

		The coherence_id entry contains the coherence id.
		A partitioned SGI UV system can have one or more coherence
		domain.  The coherence id indicates which coherence domain
		this partition is in.  To display the coherence id, use the
		command:

			cat /sys/firmware/sgi_uv/coherence_id
