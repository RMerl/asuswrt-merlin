What:		/sys/bus/i2c/devices/<busnum>-<devaddr>/pressure0_input
Date:		June 2010
Contact:	Christoph Mair <christoph.mair@gmail.com>
Description:	Start a pressure measurement and read the result. Values
		represent the ambient air pressure in pascal (0.01 millibar).

		Reading: returns the current air pressure.


What:		/sys/bus/i2c/devices/<busnum>-<devaddr>/temp0_input
Date:		June 2010
Contact:	Christoph Mair <christoph.mair@gmail.com>
Description:	Measure the ambient temperature. The returned value represents
		the ambient temperature in units of 0.1 degree celsius.

		Reading: returns the current temperature.


What:		/sys/bus/i2c/devices/<busnum>-<devaddr>/oversampling
Date:		June 2010
Contact:	Christoph Mair <christoph.mair@gmail.com>
Description:	Tell the bmp085 to use more samples to calculate a pressure
		value. When writing to this file the chip will use 2^x samples
		to calculate the next pressure value with x being the value
		written. Using this feature will decrease RMS noise and
		increase the measurement time.

		Reading: returns the current oversampling setting.

		Writing: sets a new oversampling setting.
		Accepted values: 0..3.
