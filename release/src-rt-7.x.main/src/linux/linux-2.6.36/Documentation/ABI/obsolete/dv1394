What:		dv1394 (a.k.a. "OHCI-DV I/O support" for FireWire)
Contact:	linux1394-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
Description:
	New application development should use raw1394 + userspace libraries
	instead, notably libiec61883 which is functionally equivalent.

Users:
	ffmpeg/libavformat (used by a variety of media players)
	dvgrab v1.x (replaced by dvgrab2 on top of raw1394 and resp. libraries)
