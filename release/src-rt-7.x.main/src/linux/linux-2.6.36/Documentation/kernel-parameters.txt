                          Kernel Parameters
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a consolidated list of the kernel parameters as implemented
(mostly) by the __setup() macro and sorted into English Dictionary order
(defined as ignoring all punctuation and sorting digits before letters in a
case insensitive manner), and with descriptions where known.

Module parameters for loadable modules are specified only as the
parameter name with optional '=' and value as appropriate, such as:

	modprobe usbcore blinkenlights=1

Module parameters for modules that are built into the kernel image
are specified on the kernel command line with the module name plus
'.' plus parameter name, with '=' and value if appropriate, such as:

	usbcore.blinkenlights=1

Hyphens (dashes) and underscores are equivalent in parameter names, so
	log_buf_len=1M print-fatal-signals=1
can also be entered as
	log-buf-len=1M print_fatal_signals=1


This document may not be entirely up to date and comprehensive. The command
"modinfo -p ${modulename}" shows a current list of all parameters of a loadable
module. Loadable modules, after being loaded into the running kernel, also
reveal their parameters in /sys/module/${modulename}/parameters/. Some of these
parameters may be changed at runtime by the command
"echo -n ${value} > /sys/module/${modulename}/parameters/${parm}".

The parameters listed below are only valid if certain kernel build options were
enabled and if respective hardware is present. The text in square brackets at
the beginning of each description states the restrictions within which a

	XEN	Xen support is enabled

In addition, the following text indicates that the option:

	BUGS=	Relates to possible processor bugs on the said processor.
	KNL	Is a kernel start-up parameter.
	BOOT	Is a boot loader parameter.

Parameters denoted with BOOT are actually interpreted by the boot
loader, and have no meaning to the kernel directly.
Do not modify the syntax of boot loader parameters without extreme
need or coordination with <Documentation/x86/boot.txt>.

There are also arch-specific kernel-parameters not documented here.
See for example <Documentation/x86/x86_64/boot-options.txt>.

Note that ALL kernel parameters listed below are CASE SENSITIVE, and that
a trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline by programs
running once the system is up.

The number of kernel parameters is not limited, but the length of the
complete command line (parameters including spaces etc.) is limited to
a fixed number of characters. This limit depends on the architecture
and is between 256 and 4096 characters. It is defined in the file
./include/asm/setup.h as COMMAND_LINE_SIZE.


	acpi=		[HW,ACPI,X86]
			Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
			Format: { force | off | strict | noirq | rsdt }
			force -- enable ACPI if default was off
			off -- disable ACPI if default was on
			noirq -- do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
			strict -- Be less tolerant of platforms that are not
				strictly ACPI specification compliant.
			rsdt -- prefer RSDT over (default) XSDT
			copy_dsdt -- copy DSDT to memory

			See also Documentation/power/pm.txt, pci=noacpi

	acpi_apic_instance=	[ACPI, IOAPIC]
			Format: <int>
			2: use 2nd APIC table, if available
			1,0: use 1st APIC table
			default: 0

	acpi_backlight=	[HW,ACPI]
			acpi_backlight=vendor
			acpi_backlight=video
			If set to vendor, prefer vendor specific driver
			(e.g. thinkpad_acpi, sony_acpi, etc.) instead
			of the ACPI video.ko driver.

	acpi.debug_layer=	[HW,ACPI,ACPI_DEBUG]
	acpi.debug_level=	[HW,ACPI,ACPI_DEBUG]
			Format: <int>
			CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG must be enabled to produce any ACPI
			debug output.  Bits in debug_layer correspond to a
			_COMPONENT in an ACPI source file, e.g.,
			    #define _COMPONENT ACPI_PCI_COMPONENT
			Bits in debug_level correspond to a level in
			ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT statements, e.g.,
			    ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT((ACPI_DB_INFO, ...
			The debug_level mask defaults to "info".  See
			Documentation/acpi/debug.txt for more information about
			debug layers and levels.

			Enable processor driver info messages:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x20000000
			Enable PCI/PCI interrupt routing info messages:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x400000
			Enable AML "Debug" output, i.e., stores to the Debug
			object while interpreting AML:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0xffffffff acpi.debug_level=0x2
			Enable all messages related to ACPI hardware:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x2 acpi.debug_level=0xffffffff

			Some values produce so much output that the system is
			unusable.  The "log_buf_len" parameter may be useful
			if you need to capture more output.

	acpi_display_output=	[HW,ACPI]
			acpi_display_output=vendor
			acpi_display_output=video
			See above.

	acpi_irq_balance [HW,ACPI]
			ACPI will balance active IRQs
			default in APIC mode

	acpi_irq_nobalance [HW,ACPI]
			ACPI will not move active IRQs (default)
			default in PIC mode

	acpi_irq_isa=	[HW,ACPI] If irq_balance, mark listed IRQs used by ISA
			Format: <irq>,<irq>...

	acpi_irq_pci=	[HW,ACPI] If irq_balance, clear listed IRQs for
			use by PCI
			Format: <irq>,<irq>...

	acpi_no_auto_ssdt	[HW,ACPI] Disable automatic loading of SSDT

			Format: To spoof as Windows 98: ="Microsoft Windows"

	acpi_osi=	[HW,ACPI] Modify list of supported OS interface strings
			acpi_osi="string1"	# add string1 -- only one string
			acpi_osi="!string2"	# remove built-in string2
			acpi_osi=		# disable all strings

	acpi_pm_good	[X86]
			Override the pmtimer bug detection: force the kernel
			to assume that this machine's pmtimer latches its value
			and always returns good values.

	acpi_sci=	[HW,ACPI] ACPI System Control Interrupt trigger mode
			Format: { level | edge | high | low }

	acpi_serialize	[HW,ACPI] force serialization of AML methods

	acpi_skip_timer_override [HW,ACPI]
			Recognize and ignore IRQ0/pin2 Interrupt Override.
			For broken nForce2 BIOS resulting in XT-PIC timer.

	acpi_sleep=	[HW,ACPI] Sleep options
			Format: { s3_bios, s3_mode, s3_beep, s4_nohwsig,
				  old_ordering, s4_nonvs, sci_force_enable }
			See Documentation/power/video.txt for information on
			s3_bios and s3_mode.
			s3_beep is for debugging; it makes the PC's speaker beep
			as soon as the kernel's real-mode entry point is called.
			s4_nohwsig prevents ACPI hardware signature from being
			used during resume from hibernation.
			old_ordering causes the ACPI 1.0 ordering of the _PTS
			control method, with respect to putting devices into
			low power states, to be enforced (the ACPI 2.0 ordering
			of _PTS is used by default).
			nonvs prevents the kernel from saving/restoring the
			ACPI NVS memory during suspend/hibernation and resume.
			sci_force_enable causes the kernel to set SCI_EN directly
			on resume from S1/S3 (which is against the ACPI spec,
			but some broken systems don't work without it).

	acpi_use_timer_override [HW,ACPI]
			Use timer override. For some broken Nvidia NF5 boards
			that require a timer override, but don't have HPET

	acpi_enforce_resources=	[ACPI]
			{ strict | lax | no }
			Check for resource conflicts between native drivers
			and ACPI OperationRegions (SystemIO and SystemMemory
			only). IO ports and memory declared in ACPI might be
			used by the ACPI subsystem in arbitrary AML code and
			can interfere with legacy drivers.
			strict (default): access to resources claimed by ACPI
			is denied; legacy drivers trying to access reserved
			resources will fail to bind to device using them.
			lax: access to resources claimed by ACPI is allowed;
			legacy drivers trying to access reserved resources
			will bind successfully but a warning message is logged.
			no: ACPI OperationRegions are not marked as reserved,
			no further checks are performed.

			kernel's map of available physical RAM.

	agp=		[AGP]

	ALSA		[HW,ALSA]
			See Documentation/sound/alsa/alsa-parameters.txt

	alignment=	[KNL,ARM]
			Allow the default userspace alignment fault handler
			behaviour to be specified.  Bit 0 enables warnings,
			bit 1 enables fixups, and bit 2 sends a segfault.

	amd_iommu=	[HW,X86-84]
			Pass parameters to the AMD IOMMU driver in the system.
			Possible values are:
			fullflush - enable flushing of IO/TLB entries when
				    they are unmapped. Otherwise they are
				    flushed before they will be reused, which
				    is a lot of faster
			off	  - do not initialize any AMD IOMMU found in
				    the system

	amijoy.map=	[HW,JOY] Amiga joystick support
			Map of devices attached to JOY0DAT and JOY1DAT

			Disable APC CPU standby support. SPARCstation-Fox does
			not play well with APC CPU idle - disable it if you have
			APC and your system crashes randomly.

	apic=		[APIC,X86-32] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
			Change the output verbosity whilst booting
			Format: { quiet (default) | verbose | debug }

	autoconf=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	show_lapic=	[APIC,X86] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller

	bttv.tuner=	and Documentation/video4linux/bttv/CARDLIST

	c101=		[NET] Moxa C101 synchronous serial card

	cachesize=	[BUGS=X86-32] Override level 2 CPU cache size detection.
			Sometimes CPU hardware bugs make them report the cache
			size incorrectly. The kernel will attempt work arounds
			to fix known problems, but for some CPUs it is not
			possible to determine what the correct size should be.
			This option provides an override for these situations.

	capability.disable=
			[SECURITY] Disable capabilities.  This would normally
			be used only if an alternative security model is to be
			configured.  Potentially dangerous and should only be
			used if you are entirely sure of the consequences.

	ccw_timeout_log [S390]
			See Documentation/s390/CommonIO for details.

			Format: {name of the controller(s) to disable}
				{Currently supported controllers - "memory"}

	checkreqprot	[SELINUX] Set initial checkreqprot flag value.

	clearcpuid=BITNUM [X86]
			Disable CPUID feature X for the kernel. See
			arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h for the valid bit
			numbers. Note the Linux specific bits are not necessarily
			stable over kernel options, but the vendor specific
			ones should be.
			Also note that user programs calling CPUID directly
			or using the feature without checking anything
			will still see it. This just prevents it from
			being used by the kernel or shown in /proc/cpuinfo.
			Also note the kernel might malfunction if you disable
			some critical bits.

	cmo_free_hint=	[PPC] Format: { yes | no }
			Specify whether pages are marked as being inactive

	console=	[KNL] Output console device and options.

		tty<n>	Use the virtual console device <n>.

		ttyS<n>[,options]
		ttyUSB0[,options]
			Use the specified serial port.  The options are of
			the form "bbbbpnf", where "bbbb" is the baud rate,
			"p" is parity ("n", "o", or "e"), "n" is number of
			bits, and "f" is flow control ("r" for RTS or
			omit it).  Default is "9600n8".

			See Documentation/serial-console.txt for more
			information.  See
			Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt for an
			alternative.

		uart[8250],io,<addr>[,options]
		uart[8250],mmio,<addr>[,options]
			Start an early, polled-mode console on the 8250/16550
			UART at the specified I/O port or MMIO address,
			switching to the matching ttyS device later.  The
			options are the same as for ttyS, above.

                If the device connected to the port is not a TTY but a braille
                device, prepend "brl," before the device type, for instance
			console=brl,ttyS0
		For now, only VisioBraille is supported.

	consoleblank=	[KNL] The console blank (screen saver) timeout in
			seconds. Defaults to 10*60 = 10mins. A value of 0
			disables the blank timer.

	crashkernel=nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]
			[KNL] Reserve a chunk of physical memory to
			hold a kernel to switch to with kexec on panic.

	crashkernel=range1:size1[,range2:size2,...][@offset]
			[KNL] Same as above, but depends on the memory
			in the running system. The syntax of range is
			start-[end] where start and end are both
			a memory unit (amount[KMG]). See also
			Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for a example.

	cs89x0_dma=	[HW,NET]
			Format: <dma>

			[KNL] verbose self-tests
			Format=<0|1>
			Print debugging info while doing the locking API
			self-tests.

			1 will print _a lot_ more information - normally
			only useful to kernel developers.

	debug_objects	[KNL] Enable object debugging

	no_debug_objects
			[KNL] Disable object debugging

	debugpat	[X86] Enable PAT debugging

	decnet.addr=	[HW,NET]
			Format: <area>[,<node>]
			See also Documentation/networking/decnet.txt.

	default_hugepagesz=

			if not specified.

	dhash_entries=	[KNL]
			Set number of hash buckets for dentry cache.

	digi=		[HW,SERIAL]
			IO parameters + enable/disable command.

	digiepca=	[HW,SERIAL]

	disable_ipv6=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	disable_mtrr_cleanup [X86]
			The kernel tries to adjust MTRR layout from continuous
			to discrete, to make X server driver able to add WB
			entry later. This parameter disables that.

	disable_mtrr_trim [X86, Intel and AMD only]
			By default the kernel will trim any uncacheable
			memory out of your available memory pool based on
			MTRR settings.  This parameter disables that behavior,
			possibly causing your machine to run very slowly.

	disable_timer_pin_1 [X86]
			Disable PIN 1 of APIC timer
			Can be useful to work around chipset bugs.

	dma_debug=off	If the kernel is compiled with DMA_API_DEBUG support,
			this option disables the debugging code at boot.

	dma_debug_entries=<number>
			This option allows to tune the number of preallocated
			entries for DMA-API debugging code. One entry is
			required per DMA-API allocation. Use this if the
			DMA-API debugging code disables itself because the
			architectural default is too low.

	dma_debug_driver=<driver_name>
			With this option the DMA-API debugging driver
			filter feature can be enabled at boot time. Just
			pass the driver to filter for as the parameter.
			The filter can be disabled or changed to another
			driver later using sysfs.

	dscc4.setup=	[NET]

	dynamic_printk	Enables pr_debug()/dev_dbg() calls if
			CONFIG_DYNAMIC_PRINTK_DEBUG has been enabled.
			These can also be switched on/off via
			<debugfs>/dynamic_printk/modules

	earlycon=	[KNL] Output early console device and options.

		uart[8250],mmio32,<addr>[,options]
			Start an early, polled-mode console on the 8250/16550
			UART at the specified I/O port or MMIO address.
			MMIO inter-register address stride is either 8bit (mmio)
                        or 32bit (mmio32).
			The options are the same as for ttyS, above.

	earlyprintk=	[X86,SH,BLACKFIN]
			earlyprintk=vga

	idle=		[X86]
			Format: idle=poll, idle=mwait, idle=halt, idle=nomwait
			Poll forces a polling idle loop that can slightly
			improve the performance of waking up a idle CPU, but
			will use a lot of power and make the system run hot.
			Not recommended.
			idle=mwait: On systems which support MONITOR/MWAIT but
			the kernel chose to not use it because it doesn't save
			as much power as a normal idle loop, use the
			MONITOR/MWAIT idle loop anyways. Performance should be
			the same as idle=poll.

			this case, gfx device will use physical address for
			DMA.
		forcedac [x86_64]
			With this option iommu will not optimize to look
			for io virtual address below 32 bit forcing dual
			address cycle on pci bus for cards supporting greater
			than 32 bit addressing. The default is to look

			Format: <RDP>,<reset>,<pci_scan>,<verbosity>

	isolcpus=	[KNL,SMP] Isolate CPUs from the general scheduler.
			Format:
			<cpu number>,...,<cpu number>
			or
			<cpu number>-<cpu number>
			(must be a positive range in ascending order)

			This option can be used to specify one or more CPUs
			to isolate from the general SMP balancing and scheduling
			algorithms. You can move a process onto or off an
			"isolated" CPU via the CPU affinity syscalls or cpuset.
			<cpu number> begins at 0 and the maximum value is
			"number of CPUs in system - 1".

			This option is the preferred way to isolate CPUs. The
			alternative -- manually setting the CPU mask of all
			tasks in the system -- can cause problems and
			suboptimal load balancer performance.

	iucv=		[HW,NET]

	js=		[HW,JOY] Analog joystick
			See Documentation/input/joystick.txt.

	keepinitrd	[HW,ARM]

	kernelcore=nn[KMG]	[KNL,X86,IA-64,PPC] This parameter
			specifies the amount of memory usable by the kernel
			for non-movable allocations.  The requested amount is
			spread evenly throughout all nodes in the system. The
			remaining memory in each node is used for Movable
			pages. In the event, a node is too small to have both
			kernelcore and Movable pages, kernelcore pages will
			take priority and other nodes will have a larger number
			of kernelcore pages.  The Movable zone is used for the
			allocation of pages that may be reclaimed or moved
			by the page migration subsystem.  This means that
			HugeTLB pages may not be allocated from this zone.
			Note that allocations like PTEs-from-HighMem still
			use the HighMem zone if it exists, and the Normal
			zone if it does not.

	kgdbdbgp=	[KGDB,HW] kgdb over EHCI usb debug port.

			not using this parameter you use sysrq-g to break into
			the kernel debugger.

	kgdboc=		[KGDB,HW] kgdb over consoles.

			PORT[.DEVICE].  PORT and DEVICE are decimal numbers
			matching port, link or device.  Basically, it matches
			the ATA ID string printed on console by libata.  If
			the whole ID part is omitted, the last PORT and DEVICE
			values are used.  If ID hasn't been specified yet, the
			configuration applies to all ports, links and devices.

			If only DEVICE is omitted, the parameter applies to
			the port and all links and devices behind it.  DEVICE
			number of 0 either selects the first device or the
			first fan-out link behind PMP device.  It does not
			select the host link.  DEVICE number of 15 selects the
			host link and device attached to it.

			The VAL specifies the configuration to force.  As long
			as there's no ambiguity shortcut notation is allowed.
			For example, both 1.5 and 1.5G would work for 1.5Gbps.
			The following configurations can be forced.

			* Cable type: 40c, 80c, short40c, unk, ign or sata.
			  Any ID with matching PORT is used.

			* SATA link speed limit: 1.5Gbps or 3.0Gbps.

			  udma[/][16,25,33,44,66,100,133] notation is also
			  allowed.

			* [no]ncq: Turn on or off NCQ.

			* nohrst, nosrst, norst: suppress hard, soft
                          and both resets.

			If there are multiple matching configurations changing
			the same attribute, the last one is used.

	loglevel=	All Kernel Messages with a loglevel smaller than the
			console loglevel will be printed to the console. It can
			also be changed with klogd or other programs. The
			loglevels are defined as follows:

			0 (KERN_EMERG)		system is unusable
			1 (KERN_ALERT)		action must be taken immediately

			This may be used to provide more screen space for
			kernel log messages and is useful when debugging
			kernel boot problems.

	lp=0		[LP]	Specify parallel ports to use, e.g,
	lp=port[,port...]	lp=none,parport0 (lp0 not configured, lp1 uses
	lp=reset		first parallel port). 'lp=0' disables the
	lp=auto			printer driver. 'lp=reset' (which can be
				specified in addition to the ports) causes
				attached printers to be reset. Using
				lp=port1,port2,... specifies the parallel ports
				to associate lp devices with, starting with
				lp0. A port specification may be 'none' to skip
				that lp device, or a parport name such as
				'parport0'. Specifying 'lp=auto' instead of a
				port specification list means that device IDs
				from each port should be examined, to see if
				an IEEE 1284-compliant printer is attached; if
				so, the driver will manage that printer.
				See also header of drivers/char/lp.c.

	lpj=n		[KNL]
			Sets loops_per_jiffy to given constant, thus avoiding
			time-consuming boot-time autodetection (up to 250 ms per
			CPU). 0 enables autodetection (default). To determine
			the correct value for your kernel, boot with normal
			autodetection and see what value is printed. Note that
			on SMP systems the preset will be applied to all CPUs,
			which is likely to cause problems if your CPUs need
			significantly divergent settings. An incorrect value
			will cause delays in the kernel to be wrong, leading to
			unpredictable I/O errors and other breakage. Although
			unlikely, in the extreme case this might damage your
			hardware.

	ltpc=		[NET]
			Format: <io>,<irq>,<dma>

	machvec=	[IA64] Force the use of a particular machine-vector

			Example: Exclude memory from 0x18690000-0x1869ffff
			         memmap=64K$0x18690000
			         or
			         memmap=0x10000$0x18690000

	memory_corruption_check=0/1 [X86]
			Some BIOSes seem to corrupt the first 64k of
			memory when doing things like suspend/resume.
			Setting this option will scan the memory
			looking for corruption.  Enabling this will
			both detect corruption and prevent the kernel
			from using the memory being corrupted.
			However, its intended as a diagnostic tool; if
			repeatable BIOS-originated corruption always
			affects the same memory, you can use memmap=
			to prevent the kernel from using that memory.

	memory_corruption_check_size=size [X86]
			By default it checks for corruption in the low
			64k, making this memory unavailable for normal
			use.  Use this parameter to scan for
			corruption in more or less memory.

	memory_corruption_check_period=seconds [X86]
			By default it checks for corruption every 60
			seconds.  Use this parameter to check at some
			other rate.  0 disables periodic checking.

	memtest=	[KNL,X86] Enable memtest
			Format: <integer>
			default : 0 <disable>
			Specifies the number of memtest passes to be
			performed. Each pass selects another test
			pattern from a given set of patterns. Memtest
			fills the memory with this pattern, validates
			memory contents and reserves bad memory
			regions that are detected.

			2 - The VGA Shield is attached (1024x768)
			Leaving out the screen size parameter will not load
			the TFT driver, and the framebuffer will be left
			unconfigured.
			b - Enable backlight. The TFT backlight pin will be
			linked to the kernel VESA blanking code and a GPIO
			LED. This parameter is not necessary when using the
			VGA shield.
			c - Enable the s3c camera interface.
			t - Reserved for enabling touchscreen support. The
			touchscreen support is not enabled in the mainstream
			kernel as of 2.6.30, a preliminary port can be found

			is similar to kernelcore except it specifies the
			amount of memory used for migratable allocations.
			If both kernelcore and movablecore is specified,
			then kernelcore will be at *least* the specified
			value but may be more. If movablecore on its own
			is specified, the administrator must be careful
			that the amount of memory usable for all allocations
			is not too small.

	nmi_debug=	[KNL,AVR32,SH] Specify one or more actions to take
			when a NMI is triggered.
			Format: [state][,regs][,debounce][,die]

			Valid num: 0,1,2
			0 - turn nmi_watchdog off
			1 - use the IO-APIC timer for the NMI watchdog
			2 - use the local APIC for the NMI watchdog using
			a performance counter. Note: This will use one

			possible conflicts). You can specify the base
			address, IRQ, and DMA settings; IRQ and DMA
			should be numbers, or 'auto' (for using detected
			settings on that particular port), or 'nofifo'

				the hardware directly. Use this if your machine
				has a non-standard PCI host bridge.
		nobios		[X86-32] disallow use of PCI BIOS, only direct
				hardware access methods are allowed. Use this
				if you experience crashes upon bootup and you
				suspect they are caused by the BIOS.
		conf1		[X86] Force use of PCI Configuration
				Mechanism 1.
		conf2		[X86] Force use of PCI Configuration
				Mechanism 2.
		noaer		[PCIE] If the PCIEAER kernel config parameter is

				disable the use of PCIE advanced error reporting.
		nodomains	[PCI] Disable support for multiple PCI
				root domains (aka PCI segments, in ACPI-speak).
		nommconf	[X86] Disable use of MMCONFIG for PCI

				Safety option to keep boot IRQs enabled. This
				should never be necessary.

				boot IRQ equivalent of an IRQ that connects to
				a chipset where boot IRQs cannot be disabled.
				The opposite of ioapicreroute.
		biosirq		[X86-32] Use PCI BIOS calls to get the interrupt
				routing table. These calls are known to be buggy
				on several machines and they hang the machine
				when used, but on other computers it's the only
				way to get the interrupt routing table. Try
				this option if the kernel is unable to allocate
				IRQs or discover secondary PCI buses on your
				motherboard.
		rom		[X86] Assign address space to expansion ROMs.
				Use with caution as certain devices share
				address decoders between ROMs and other
				resources.
		norom		[X86] Do not assign address space to

				of the PIRQ table (normally generated
				by the BIOS) if it is outside the
				F0000h-100000h range.

				explicitly which ones they are.
		assign-busses	[X86] Always assign all PCI bus
				numbers ourselves, overriding
				whatever the firmware may have done.
		usepirqmask	[X86] Honor the possible IRQ mask stored
				in the BIOS $PIR table. This is needed on
				some systems with broken BIOSes, notably
				some HP Pavilion N5400 and Omnibook XE3
				notebooks. This will have no effect if ACPI
				IRQ routing is enabled.
		noacpi		[X86] Do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
				or for PCI scanning.
		use_crs		[X86] Use PCI host bridge window information
				from ACPI.  On BIOSes from 2008 or later, this
				is enabled by default.  If you need to use this,
				please report a bug.
		nocrs		[X86] Ignore PCI host bridge windows from ACPI.
			        If you need to use this, please report a bug.
		routeirq	Do IRQ routing for all PCI devices.
				This is normally done in pci_enable_device(),
				so this option is a temporary workaround
				for broken drivers that don't call it.
		skip_isa_align	[X86] do not align io start addr, so can
				handle more pci cards
		firmware	[ARM] Do not re-enumerate the bus but instead
				just use the configuration from the
				bootloader. This is currently used on

				configured a certain way for adjunct CPUs.
		noearly		[X86] Don't do any early type 1 scanning.
				This might help on some broken boards which
				machine check when some devices' config space
				is read. But various workarounds are disabled
				and some IOMMU drivers will not work.
		bfsort		Sort PCI devices into breadth-first order.
				This sorting is done to get a device
				order compatible with older (<= 2.4) kernels.
		nobfsort	Don't sort PCI devices into breadth-first order.
		cbiosize=nn[KMG]	The fixed amount of bus space which is
				reserved for the CardBus bridge's IO window.
				The default value is 256 bytes.
