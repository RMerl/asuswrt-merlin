Description
-----------

This driver implements support for Texas Instruments TMP401 and
TMP411 chips. These chips implements one remote and one local
temperature sensor. Temperature is measured in degrees
Celsius. Resolution of the remote sensor is 0.0625 degree. Local
sensor resolution can be set to 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 or 0.0625 degree (not
supported by the driver so far, so using the default resolution of 0.5
degree).

The driver provides the common sysfs-interface for temperatures (see
/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface under Temperatures).

The TMP411 chip is compatible with TMP401. It provides some additional
features.

* Minimum and Maximum temperature measured since power-on, chip-reset

  Exported via sysfs attributes tempX_lowest and tempX_highest.

* Reset of historical minimum/maximum temperature measurements

  Exported via sysfs attribute temp_reset_history. Writing 1 to this
  file triggers a reset.
