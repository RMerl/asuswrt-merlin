Module Parameters
-----------------

* se_input: bool (default Y)
  Single ended operation - set to N for differential mode
* int_vref: bool (default Y)
  Operate with the internal 2.5V reference - set to N for external reference
* vref_mv: int (default 2500)
  If using an external reference, set this to the reference voltage in mV

Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Texas Instruments ADS7828.

This device is a 12-bit 8-channel A-D converter.

It can operate in single ended mode (8 +ve inputs) or in differential mode,
where 4 differential pairs can be measured.

The chip also has the facility to use an external voltage reference.  This
may be required if your hardware supplies the ADS7828 from a 5V supply, see
the datasheet for more details.
