Description
-----------

This driver implements support for JEDEC JC 42.4 compliant temperature sensors.
The driver auto-detects the chips listed above, but can be manually instantiated
to support other JC 42.4 compliant chips.

Example: the following will load the driver for a generic JC 42.4 compliant
temperature sensor at address 0x18 on I2C bus #1:

# modprobe jc42
# echo jc42 0x18 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-1/new_device

A JC 42.4 compliant chip supports a single temperature sensor. Minimum, maximum,
and critical temperature can be configured. There are alarms for high, low,
and critical thresholds.

There is also an hysteresis to control the thresholds for resetting alarms.
Per JC 42.4 specification, the hysteresis threshold can be configured to 0, 1.5,
3.0, and 6.0 degrees C. Configured hysteresis values will be rounded to those
limits. The chip supports only a single register to configure the hysteresis,
which applies to all limits. This register can be written by writing into
temp1_crit_hyst. Other hysteresis attributes are read-only.
