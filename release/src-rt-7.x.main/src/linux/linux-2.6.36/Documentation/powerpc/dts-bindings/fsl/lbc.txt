* Chipselect/Local Bus

Properties:
- name : Should be localbus
- #address-cells : Should be either two or three.  The first cell is the
                   chipselect number, and the remaining cells are the
                   offset into the chipselect.
- #size-cells : Either one or two, depending on how large each chipselect
                can be.
- ranges : Each range corresponds to a single chipselect, and cover
           the entire access window as configured.

Example:
	localbus@f0010100 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8272-localbus",
			   "fsl,pq2-localbus";
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <f0010100 40>;

		ranges = <0 0 fe000000 02000000
			  1 0 f4500000 00008000>;

		flash@0,0 {
			compatible = "jedec-flash";
			reg = <0 0 2000000>;
			bank-width = <4>;
			device-width = <1>;
		};

		board-control@1,0 {
			reg = <1 0 20>;
			compatible = "fsl,mpc8272ads-bcsr";
		};
	};
