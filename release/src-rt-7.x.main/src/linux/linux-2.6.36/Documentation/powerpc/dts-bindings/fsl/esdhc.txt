* Freescale Enhanced Secure Digital Host Controller (eSDHC)

The Enhanced Secure Digital Host Controller provides an interface
for MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be
    "fsl,<chip>-esdhc", "fsl,esdhc"
  - reg : should contain eSDHC registers location and length.
  - interrupts : should contain eSDHC interrupt.
  - interrupt-parent : interrupt source phandle.
  - clock-frequency : specifies eSDHC base clock frequency.
  - sdhci,wp-inverted : (optional) specifies that eSDHC controller
    reports inverted write-protect state;
  - sdhci,1-bit-only : (optional) specifies that a controller can
    only handle 1-bit data transfers.
  - sdhci,auto-cmd12: (optional) specifies that a controller can
    only handle auto CMD12.

Example:

sdhci@2e000 {
	compatible = "fsl,mpc8378-esdhc", "fsl,esdhc";
	reg = <0x2e000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <42 0x8>;
	interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
	/* Filled in by U-Boot */
	clock-frequency = <0>;
};
