		Supporting multiple CPU idle levels in kernel

				cpuidle

General Information:

Various CPUs today support multiple idle levels that are differentiated
by varying exit latencies and power consumption during idle.
cpuidle is a generic in-kernel infrastructure that separates
idle policy (governor) from idle mechanism (driver) and provides a
standardized infrastructure to support independent development of
governors and drivers.

cpuidle resides under drivers/cpuidle.

Boot options:
"cpuidle_sysfs_switch"
enables current_governor interface in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/,
which can be used to switch governors at run time. This boot option
is meant for developer testing only. In normal usage, kernel picks the
best governor based on governor ratings.
