FILES, CONFIGS AND COMPATABILITY
--------------------------------

Two files are introduced:

  a) 'arch/mips/include/asm/mach-au1x00/au1xxx_ide.h'
     containes : struct _auide_hwif
                 timing parameters for PIO mode 0/1/2/3/4
                 timing parameters for MWDMA 0/1/2

  b) 'drivers/ide/mips/au1xxx-ide.c'
     contains the functionality of the AU1XXX IDE driver

Following extra configs variables are introduced:

  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_AU1XXX_PIO_DBDMA    - enable the PIO+DBDMA mode
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_AU1XXX_MDMA2_DBDMA  - enable the MWDMA mode
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_AU1XXX_BURSTABLE_ON - set Burstable FIFO in DBDMA
                                           controller


SUPPORTED IDE MODES
-------------------

The AU1XXX IDE driver supported all PIO modes - PIO mode 0/1/2/3/4 - and all
MWDMA modes - MWDMA 0/1/2 -. There is no support for SWDMA and UDMA mode.

To change the PIO mode use the program hdparm with option -p, e.g.
'hdparm -p0 [device]' for PIO mode 0. To enable the MWDMA mode use the option
-X, e.g. 'hdparm -X32 [device]' for MWDMA mode 0.


PERFORMANCE CONFIGURATIONS
--------------------------

If the used system doesn't need USB support enable the following kernel configs:

CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_GENERIC=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_AU1XXX=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_AU1XXX_MDMA2_DBDMA=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y

Also define 'IDE_AU1XXX_BURSTMODE' in 'drivers/ide/mips/au1xxx-ide.c' to enable
the burst support on DBDMA controller.

If the used system need the USB support enable the following kernel configs for
high IDE to USB throughput.

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_GENERIC=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_AU1XXX=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_AU1XXX_MDMA2_DBDMA=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y

Also undefine 'IDE_AU1XXX_BURSTMODE' in 'drivers/ide/mips/au1xxx-ide.c' to
disable the burst support on DBDMA controller.

These drivers wouldn't have been done without the base of kernel 2.4.x AU1XXX
IDE driver from AMD.
