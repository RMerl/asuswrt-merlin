README on Implementing Linux for Sharp's KEV7a400
=================================================

This product has been discontinued by Sharp.  For the time being, the
partially implemented code remains in the kernel.  At some point in
the future, either the code will be finished or it will be removed
completely.  This depends primarily on how many of the development
boards are in the field.
