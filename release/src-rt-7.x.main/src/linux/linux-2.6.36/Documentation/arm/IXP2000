Release Notes for Linux on Intel's IXP2000 Network Processor

Maintained by Deepak Saxena <dsaxena@plexity.net>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Overview

Intel's IXP2000 family of NPUs (IXP2400, IXP2800, IXP2850) is designed
for high-performance network applications such high-availability
telecom systems. In addition to an XScale core, it contains up to 8
"MicroEngines" that run special code, several high-end networking 
interfaces (UTOPIA, SPI, etc), a PCI host bridge, one serial port,
flash interface, and some other odds and ends. For more information, see:

http://developer.intel.com

2. Linux Support

Linux currently supports the following features on the IXP2000 NPUs:

- On-chip serial
- PCI
- Flash (MTD/JFFS2)
- I2C through GPIO
- Timers (watchdog, OS)

That is about all we can support under Linux ATM b/c the core networking
components of the chip are accessed via Intel's closed source SDK. 
Please contact Intel directly on issues with using those. There is
also a mailing list run by some folks at Princeton University that might
be of help:  https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/mailman/listinfo/ixp2xxx

WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT POST EMAIL TO THE LINUX-ARM OR LINUX-ARM-KERNEL
MAILING LISTS REGARDING THE INTEL SDK.

3. Supported Platforms

- Intel IXDP2400 Reference Platform
- Intel IXDP2800 Reference Platform
- Intel IXDP2401 Reference Platform
- Intel IXDP2801 Reference Platform
- RadiSys ENP-2611

4. Usage Notes

- The IXP2000 platforms usually have rather complex PCI bus topologies
  with large memory space requirements. In addition, b/c of the way the
  Intel SDK is designed, devices are enumerated in a very specific
  way. B/c of this this, we use "pci=firmware" option in the kernel
  command line so that we do not re-enumerate the bus.

- IXDP2x01 systems have variable clock tick rates that we cannot determine 
  via HW registers. The "ixdp2x01_clk=XXX" cmd line options allow you
  to pass the clock rate to the board port.

5. Thanks
