Fax with isdn4linux
===================

When enabled during kernel configuration, the tty emulator
of the ISDN subsystem is capable of the Fax Class 2 commands.

This only makes sense under the following conditions :

- You need the commands as dummy, because you are using
  hylafax (with patch) for AVM capi.
- You want to use the fax capabilities of your isdn-card.
  (supported cards are listed below)


NOTE: This implementation does *not* support fax with passive
      ISDN-cards (known as softfax). The low-level driver of
      the ISDN-card and/or the card itself must support this.


Supported ISDN-Cards
--------------------

Eicon DIVA Server BRI/PCI
	- full support with both B-channels.

Eicon DIVA Server 4BRI/PCI
	- full support with all B-channels.

Eicon DIVA Server PRI/PCI
	- full support on amount of B-channels
		depending on DSPs on board.



The command set is known as Class 2 (not Class 2.0) and
can be activated by AT+FCLASS=2


The interface between the link-level-module and the hardware-level driver
is described in the files INTERFACE.fax and INTERFACE.
