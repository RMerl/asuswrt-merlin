SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf report' [-i <file> | --input=file]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command displays the performance counter profile information recorded
via perf record.

OPTIONS
-------
-i::
--input=::
        Input file name. (default: perf.data)
-d::
--dsos=::
	Only consider symbols in these dsos. CSV that understands
	file://filename entries.
-n::
--show-nr-samples::
	Show the number of samples for each symbol
-T::
--threads::
	Show per-thread event counters
-C::
--comms=::
	Only consider symbols in these comms. CSV that understands
	file://filename entries.
-S::
--symbols=::
	Only consider these symbols. CSV that understands
	file://filename entries.

-s::
--sort=::
	Sort by key(s): pid, comm, dso, symbol, parent.

-w::
--field-width=::
	Force each column width to the provided list, for large terminal
	readability.

-t::
--field-separator=::

	Use a special separator character and don't pad with spaces, replacing
	all occurances of this separator in symbol names (and other output)
	with a '.' character, that thus it's the only non valid separator.

-g [type,min]::
--call-graph::
        Display callchains using type and min percent threshold.
	type can be either:
	- flat: single column, linear exposure of callchains.
	- graph: use a graph tree, displaying absolute overhead rates.
	- fractal: like graph, but displays relative rates. Each branch of
		 the tree is considered as a new profiled object. +
	Default: fractal,0.5.
