# For 4707/8/9 - Required to set the DDR PHY clock correctly *before* the boot code is copied to DDR. Since the NVRAM
# parsing is done after the execution is passed to DDR, the DDR PHY clock must be reconfigured from its default of
# 333MHz. The "sdram_ncdl" parameter is stored in a fixed location in the CFE space, so the bootloader can read it while
# still executing from flash. This is a limitation of the way the DDR PHY clock reconfiguration occurs on 4707/8/9 parts.

# Set the MAC address of the Ethernet ports
# From 9/2009 onward MAC addresses have changed from that 8/16 split to a 12/12 split, so the new macmid will be
# based on MAC addresses with the following format:
#   47   40 39   32 31   24 23   16 15    8 7     0
#  |  00   |  90   |  4C   |  XX   |  XY   |  YY   |
# where the low 24 bits are evenly split into 4096 interface/ boardtypes and 4096 serial numbers. The low nibble of
# XXX cannot be 0, since that corresponds to an old style MAC address, and macmid will correspond to bits 23:12, so
# its easy to differentiate them from the old ones.
#
# The new "macmid" values will start at 1 and go up to 0xFFF, skipping those that have the low nibble as 0 and the
# ones with the patterns 0x04Ex and 0x04Fx (These restrictions are enforced in the code). To form the mac address,
# the whole OUI (00:90:4C) will be prepended to those values and 12 bits of serial number will be appended.
#
# A new-style macmid:
#   BCM947186nrh  0x008
#
# For router boards, nvserial now defines a new variable: "maclo12"
# so nvram text files for new boards will have to define the MAC address like this (for a macmid 0x008):
#   et0macaddr=00:90:4C:00:8${maclo12}
# instead of the previous way:

# If the board is a dual band design the second wireless interface (usually the "a" band)
# will come up as a second device. But we have to tell the software to hook to this

# Else, just use the standard configuration of "landevs=vlan1 wl0".

# The WAN port is almost always on an Ethernet port so use the normal config. If the WAN
# port is not an Ethernet port, then this parameter must be changed accordingly.
# NOTE: If WAN packets are vlan tagged, then must use "vlan2" in place of "et0".
#       For the default case of no WAN vlan tags, then must use "et0".
# NOTE: If the board does not have a WAN port then must use "wandevs=".
# WAN port is on eth0.
