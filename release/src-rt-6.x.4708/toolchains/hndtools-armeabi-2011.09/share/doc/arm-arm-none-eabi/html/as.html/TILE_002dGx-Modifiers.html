<h5 class="subsubsection">9.39.2.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers</h5>

<p><a name="index-TILE_002dGx-modifiers-1951"></a><a name="index-symbol-modifiers_002c-TILE_002dGx-1952"></a>
The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses
in TILE-Gx instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     modifier(symbol)
</pre>
   <p>The following modifiers are supported:

     <dl>
<dt><code>hw0</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the symbol's address.

     <br><dt><code>hw1</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the symbol's address.

     <br><dt><code>hw2</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 32-47 of the symbol's address.

     <br><dt><code>hw3</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 48-63 of the symbol's address.

     <br><dt><code>hw0_last</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw0</code>, but it also checks
that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw1_last</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw1</code>, but it also checks
that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw2_last</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw2</code>, but it also checks
that the value does not overflow.

     <p>A 48-bit symbolic value is constructed by using the following idiom:

     <pre class="smallexample">          moveli r0, hw2_last(sym)
          shl16insli r0, r0, hw1(sym)
          shl16insli r0, r0, hw0(sym)
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>hw0_got</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the symbol's offset in the
GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

     <br><dt><code>hw1_got</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the symbol's offset in the
GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

     <br><dt><code>hw2_got</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 32-47 of the symbol's offset in the
GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

     <br><dt><code>hw3_got</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 48-63 of the symbol's offset in the
GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

     <br><dt><code>hw0_last_got</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw0_got</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw1_last_got</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw1_got</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw2_last_got</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw2_got</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>plt</code><dd>
This modifier is used for function symbols.  It causes a
<em>procedure linkage table</em>, an array of code stubs, to be created
at the time the shared object is created or linked against, together
with a global offset table entry.  The value is a pc-relative offset
to the corresponding stub code in the procedure linkage table.  This
arrangement causes the run-time symbol resolver to be called to look
up and set the value of the symbol the first time the function is
called (at latest; depending environment variables).  It is only safe
to leave the symbol unresolved this way if all references are function
calls.

     <br><dt><code>hw0_tls_gd</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the offset of the GOT entry
of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for general-dynamic TLS
accesses.

     <br><dt><code>hw1_tls_gd</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the offset of the GOT
entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for general-dynamic
TLS accesses.

     <br><dt><code>hw2_tls_gd</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 32-47 of the offset of the GOT
entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for general-dynamic
TLS accesses.

     <br><dt><code>hw3_tls_gd</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 48-63 of the offset of the GOT
entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for general-dynamic
TLS accesses.

     <br><dt><code>hw0_last_tls_gd</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw0_tls_gd</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw1_last_tls_gd</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw1_tls_gd</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw2_last_tls_gd</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw2_tls_gd</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw0_tls_ie</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the offset of the GOT entry
containing the offset of the symbol's address from the TCB, to be used
for initial-exec TLS accesses.

     <br><dt><code>hw1_tls_ie</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the offset of the GOT
entry containing the offset of the symbol's address from the TCB, to
be used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

     <br><dt><code>hw2_tls_ie</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 32-47 of the offset of the GOT entry
containing the offset of the symbol's address from the TCB, to be used
for initial-exec TLS accesses.

     <br><dt><code>hw3_tls_ie</code><dd>
This modifier is used to load bits 48-63 of the offset of the GOT
entry containing the offset of the symbol's address from the TCB, to
be used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

     <br><dt><code>hw0_last_tls_ie</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw0_tls_ie</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw1_last_tls_ie</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw1_tls_ie</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.

     <br><dt><code>hw2_last_tls_ie</code><dd>
This modifier yields the same value as <code>hw2_tls_ie</code>, but it also
checks that the value does not overflow.
