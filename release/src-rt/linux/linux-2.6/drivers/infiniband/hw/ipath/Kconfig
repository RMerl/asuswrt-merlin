	---help---
	This is a driver for the obsolete QLogic Hyper-Transport
	IB host channel adapter (model QHT7140),
	including InfiniBand verbs support.  This driver allows these
	devices to be used with both kernel upper level protocols such
	as IP-over-InfiniBand as well as with userspace applications
	(in conjunction with InfiniBand userspace access).
	For QLogic PCIe QLE based cards, use the QIB driver instead.
