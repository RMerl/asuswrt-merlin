 * The entries in the dpm_active list are in a depth first order, simply
 * because children are guaranteed to be discovered after parents, and
 * are inserted at the back of the list on discovery.
 *
 * All list on the suspend path are done in reverse order, so we operate
 * on the leaves of the device tree (or forests, depending on how you want
 * to look at it ;) first. As nodes are removed from the back of the list,
 * they are inserted into the front of their destintation lists.
 *
 * Things are the reverse on the resume path - iterations are done in
 * forward order, and nodes are inserted at the back of their destination
 * lists. This way, the ancestors will be accessed before their descendents.
