 * the event may later "close" the "no suspend" period associated with it
 * directly as soon as it has been dealt with.  The pair of pm_stay_awake() and
 * pm_relax(), balanced with each other, is supposed to be used in such
 * situations.
 *
 * Second, a wakeup event may be detected by one functional unit and processed
 * by another one.  In that case the unit that has detected it cannot really
 * "close" the "no suspend" period associated with it, unless it knows in
 * advance what's going to happen to the event during processing.  This
 * knowledge, however, may not be available to it, so it can simply specify time
 * to wait before the system can be suspended and pass it as the second
 * argument of pm_wakeup_event().
 *
 * It is valid to call pm_relax() after pm_wakeup_event(), in which case the
 * "no suspend" period will be ended either by the pm_relax(), or by the timer
 * function executed when the timer expires, whichever comes first.
