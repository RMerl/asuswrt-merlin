	  Here you can fine-tune some parameters of the CinergyT2 driver.

	  Normally you don't need to touch this, but in exotic setups you
	  may fine-tune your setup and adjust e.g. DMA buffer sizes for
	  a particular application.

	help
	  USB Request Blocks for Highspeed Stream transfers are scheduled in
	  a queue for the Host Controller.

	  Usually the default value is a safe choice.

	  You may increase this number if you are using this device in a
	  Server Environment with many high-traffic USB Highspeed devices
	  sharing the same USB bus.

	  Should be a multiple of native buffer size of 512 bytes.
	  Default value is a safe choice.

	help
	  This is the interval for status readouts from the demodulator.
	  You may try lower values if you need more responsive signal quality
	  measurements.

	  Please keep in mind that these updates cause traffic on the tuner
	  control bus and thus may or may not affect reception sensitivity.

	  The default value should be a safe choice for common applications.

	  a safe choice.
