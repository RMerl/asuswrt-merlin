	  Say Y when you have a DVB card and want to use it. Say Y if your want
	  to build your drivers outside the kernel, but need the DVB core. All
	  in-kernel drivers will select this automatically if needed.

	  API specs and user tools are available from <http://www.linuxtv.org/>.

	  Remove the static dependency of DVB card drivers on all
	  frontend modules for all possible card variants. Instead,
	  allow the card drivers to only load the frontend modules
	  they require. This saves several KBytes of memory.

	  Note: You will need module-init-tools v3.2 or later for this feature.

	  If unsure say Y.
