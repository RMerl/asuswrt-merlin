 * transmit characters every time rs_interrupt is called. Thus, quite often
 * you'll see that a receive interrupt occures before the transmit one.

 * 68328 and 68EZ328 UARTS are a little bit different. EZ328 has special
 * "Old data interrupt" which occures whenever the data stay in the FIFO
 * longer than 30 bits time. This allows us to use FIFO without compromising
 * latency. '328 does not have this feature and without the real  328-based
 * board I would assume that RXRE is the safest setting.
 *
 * For EZ328 I use RXHE (Half empty) interrupt to reduce the number of
 * interrupts. RXFE (receive queue full) causes the system to lose data
 * at least at 115200 baud
 *
 * If your board is busy doing other stuff, you might consider to use
 * RXRE (data ready intrrupt) instead.
 *
 * The other option is to make these INTR masks run-time configurable, so
 * that people can dynamically adapt them according to the current usage.
