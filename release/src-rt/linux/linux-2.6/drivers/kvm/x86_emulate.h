/*
 * x86_emulate_ops:
 *
 * These operations represent the instruction emulator's interface to memory.
 * There are two categories of operation: those that act on ordinary memory
 * regions (*_std), and those that act on memory regions known to require
 * special treatment or emulation (*_emulated).
 *
 * The emulator assumes that an instruction accesses only one 'emulated memory'
 * location, that this location is the given linear faulting address (cr2), and
 * that this is one of the instruction's data operands. Instruction fetches and
 * stack operations are assumed never to access emulated memory. The emulator
 * automatically deduces which operand of a string-move operation is accessing
 * emulated memory, and assumes that the other operand accesses normal memory.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *  1. The emulator isn't very smart about emulated vs. standard memory.
 *     'Emulated memory' access addresses should be checked for sanity.
 *     'Normal memory' accesses may fault, and the caller must arrange to
 *     detect and handle reentrancy into the emulator via recursive faults.
 *     Accesses may be unaligned and may cross page boundaries.
 *  2. If the access fails (cannot emulate, or a standard access faults) then
 *     it is up to the memop to propagate the fault to the guest VM via
 *     some out-of-band mechanism, unknown to the emulator. The memop signals
 *     failure by returning X86EMUL_PROPAGATE_FAULT to the emulator, which will
 *     then immediately bail.
 *  3. Valid access sizes are 1, 2, 4 and 8 bytes. On x86/32 systems only
 *     cmpxchg8b_emulated need support 8-byte accesses.
 *  4. The emulator cannot handle 64-bit mode emulation on an x86/32 system.
