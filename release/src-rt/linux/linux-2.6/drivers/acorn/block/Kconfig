	  Support the floppy drive on the Acorn Archimedes (A300, A4x0, A540,
	  R140 and R260) series of computers; it supports only 720K floppies
	  at the moment. If you don't have one of these machines just answer
	  N.

config BLK_DEV_MFM

	help
	  Support the MFM hard drives on the Acorn Archimedes both
	  on-board the A4x0 motherboards and via the Acorn MFM podules.
	  Drives up to 64MB are supported. If you haven't got one of these
	  machines or drives just say N.

config BLK_DEV_MFM_AUTODETECT
	bool "Autodetect hard drive geometry"
	depends on BLK_DEV_MFM
	help
	  If you answer Y, the MFM code will attempt to automatically detect
	  the cylinders/heads/sectors count on your hard drive. WARNING: This
	  sometimes doesn't work and it also does some dodgy stuff which
	  potentially might damage your drive.
