#define SCSI_CCISS_CAN_QUEUE 2

/* 

Note, cmd_per_lun could give us some trouble, so I'm setting it very low.
Likewise, SCSI_CCISS_CAN_QUEUE is set very conservatively.

If the upper scsi layer tries to track how many commands we have 
outstanding, it will be operating under the misapprehension that it is
the only one sending us requests.  We also have the block interface,
which is where most requests must surely come from, so the upper layer's
notion of how many requests we have outstanding will be wrong most or
all of the time. 

Note, the normal SCSI mid-layer error handling doesn't work well
for this driver because 1) it takes the io_request_lock before
calling error handlers and uses a local variable to store flags,
so the io_request_lock cannot be released and interrupts enabled
inside the error handlers, and, the error handlers cannot poll
for command completion because they might get commands from the
block half of the driver completing, and not know what to do
with them.  That's what we get for making a hybrid scsi/block
driver, I suppose.
