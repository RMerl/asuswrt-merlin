// i2ChanStr -- Channel Structure:

// If we make some limits on the maximum block sizes, we can avoid dealing with
// buffer wrap. The wrapping of the buffer is based on where the start of the
// packet is. Then there is always room for the packet contiguously.
//
// Maximum total length of an outgoing data or in-line command block. The limit
// of 36 on data is quite arbitrary and based more on DOS memory limitations
// than the board interface. However, for commands, the maximum packet length is
// MAX_CMD_PACK_SIZE, because the field size for the count is only a few bits
// (see I2PACK.H) in such packets. For data packets, the count field size is not
// the limiting factor. As of this writing, MAX_OBUF_BLOCK < MAX_CMD_PACK_SIZE,
// but be careful if wanting to modify either.
//
#define MAX_OBUF_BLOCK  36

// Another note on maximum block sizes: we are buffering packets here. Data is
// put into the buffer (if there is room) regardless of the credits from the
// board. The board sends new credits whenever it has removed from his buffers a
// number of characters equal to 80% of total buffer size. (Of course, the total
// buffer size is what is reported when the very first set of flow control
// status packets are received from the board. Therefore, to be robust, you must
// always fill the board to at least 80% of the current credit limit, else you
// might not give it enough to trigger a new report. These conditions are
// obtained here so long as the maximum output block size is less than 20% the
// size of the board's output buffers. This is true at present by "coincidence"
// or "infernal knowledge": the board's output buffers are at least 700 bytes
// long (20% = 140 bytes, at least). The 80% figure is "official", so the safest
// strategy might be to trap the first flow control report and guarantee that
// the effective maxObufBlock is the minimum of MAX_OBUF_BLOCK and 20% of first
// reported buffer credit.
