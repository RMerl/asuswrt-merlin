config DRM
	tristate "Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support)"
	depends on (AGP || AGP=n) && PCI && !EMULATED_CMPXCHG
	help
	  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
	  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support.

config DRM_TDFX
	tristate "3dfx Banshee/Voodoo3+"
	depends on DRM && PCI
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a 3dfx Banshee or Voodoo3 (or later),
	  graphics card.  If M is selected, the module will be called tdfx.

config DRM_R128
	tristate "ATI Rage 128"
	depends on DRM && PCI
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Rage 128 graphics card.  If M
	  is selected, the module will be called r128.  AGP support for
	  this card is strongly suggested (unless you have a PCI version).

config DRM_RADEON
	tristate "ATI Radeon"
	depends on DRM && PCI
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Radeon graphics card.  There
	  are both PCI and AGP versions.  You don't need to choose this to
	  run the Radeon in plain VGA mode.
	  
	  If M is selected, the module will be called radeon.

config DRM_I810
	tristate "Intel I810"
	depends on DRM && AGP && AGP_INTEL
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an Intel I810 graphics card.  If M is
	  selected, the module will be called i810.  AGP support is required
	  for this driver to work.

config DRM_I830
	tristate "i830 driver"
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a system that has Intel 830M, 845G,
	  852GM, 855GM or 865G integrated graphics.  If M is selected, the
	  module will be called i830.  AGP support is required for this driver
	  to work. This driver is used by the older X releases X.org 6.7 and
	  XFree86 4.3. If unsure, build this and i915 as modules and the X server
	  will load the correct one.

config DRM_I915
	tristate "i915 driver"
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a system that has Intel 830M, 845G,
	  852GM, 855GM 865G or 915G integrated graphics.  If M is selected, the
	  module will be called i915.  AGP support is required for this driver
	  to work. This driver is used by the Intel driver in X.org 6.8 and
	  XFree86 4.4 and above. If unsure, build this and i830 as modules and 
	  the X server will load the correct one.
