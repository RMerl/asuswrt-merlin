 *      This code is loosely based on the Linux serial driver, written by
 *      Linus Torvalds, Theodore T'so and others. The RISCom/8 card 
 *      programming info was obtained from various drivers for other OSes 
 *	(FreeBSD, ISC, etc), but no source code from those drivers were 
 *	directly included in this driver.
