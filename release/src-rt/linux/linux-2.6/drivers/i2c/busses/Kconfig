	help
	  This supports the use of the I2C interface on Atmel AT91

	  This driver is BROKEN because the controller which it uses
	  will easily trigger RX overrun and TX underrun errors.  Using
	  low I2C clock rates may partially work around those issues
	  on some systems.  Another serious problem is that there is no
	  documented way to issue repeated START conditions, as needed
	  to support combined I2C messages.  Use the i2c-gpio driver

	depends on USB
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for Diolan
	  U2C-12, a USB to I2C interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module

config I2C_PARPORT
	tristate "Parallel port adapter"
	depends on PARPORT
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	select I2C_SMBUS
	help
	  This supports parallel port I2C adapters such as the ones made by
	  Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more.
	  Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with
	  no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.

	  This driver is a replacement for (and was inspired by) an older
	  driver named i2c-philips-par.  The new driver supports more devices,
	  and makes it easier to add support for new devices.

	  An adapter type parameter is now mandatory.  Please read the file
	  Documentation/i2c/busses/i2c-parport for details.

	  Another driver exists, named i2c-parport-light, which doesn't depend
	  on the parport driver.  This is meant for embedded systems. Don't say
	  Y here if you intend to say Y or M there.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-parport.

config I2C_PARPORT_LIGHT
	tristate "Parallel port adapter (light)"
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	select I2C_SMBUS
	help
	  This supports parallel port I2C adapters such as the ones made by
	  Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more.
	  Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with
	  no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.

	  This driver is a light version of i2c-parport.  It doesn't depend
	  on the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead.  This
	  might be preferred on embedded systems where wasting memory for
	  the clean but heavy parport handling is not an option.  The
	  drawback is a reduced portability and the impossibility to
	  daisy-chain other parallel port devices.

	  Don't say Y here if you said Y or M to i2c-parport.  Saying M to
	  both is possible but both modules should not be loaded at the same
	  time.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-parport-light.

config I2C_TAOS_EVM

	  This supports TAOS evaluation modules on serial port. In order to
	  use this driver, you will need the inputattach tool, which is part
	  of the input-utils package.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-taos-evm.

config I2C_TINY_USB

	  http://www.harbaum.org/till/i2c_tiny_usb for hardware details.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module

	  parallel bus to I2C bus controller.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-pca-isa.

	  This device is almost undetectable and using this driver on a
	  system which doesn't have this device will result in long
	  delays when I2C/SMBus chip drivers are loaded (e.g. at boot
	  time).  If unsure, say N.

	  If you do build this module, be sure to read the notes and warnings
