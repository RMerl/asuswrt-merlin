/* This implements an i2c-core-like thing for ISA hardware monitoring
   chips. Such chips are linked to the i2c subsystem for historical
   reasons (because the early ISA hardware monitoring chips such as the
   LM78 had both an I2C and an ISA interface). They used to be
   registered with the main i2c-core, but as a first step in the
   direction of a clean separation between I2C and ISA chip drivers,
   we now have this separate core for ISA ones. It is significantly
   more simple than the real one, of course, because we don't have to
   handle multiple busses: there is only one (fake) ISA adapter.
   It is worth noting that we still rely on i2c-core for some things
   at the moment - but hopefully this won't last. */
