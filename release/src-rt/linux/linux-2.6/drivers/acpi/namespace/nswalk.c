 * DESCRIPTION: Performs a modified depth-first walk of the namespace tree,
 *              starting (and ending) at the node specified by start_handle.
 *              The user_function is called whenever a node that matches
 *              the type parameter is found.  If the user function returns
 *              a non-zero value, the search is terminated immediately and this
 *              value is returned to the caller.
 *
 *              The point of this procedure is to provide a generic namespace
 *              walk routine that can be called from multiple places to
 *              provide multiple services;  the User Function can be tailored
 *              to each task, whether it is a print function, a compare
 *              function, etc.
