 * DESCRIPTION: Search a single level of the namespace. Performs a
 *              simple search of the specified level, and does not add
 *              entries or search parents.
 *
 *
 *      Named object lists are built (and subsequently dumped) in the
 *      order in which the names are encountered during the namespace load;
 *
 *      All namespace searching is linear in this implementation, but
 *      could be easily modified to support any improved search
 *      algorithm. However, the linear search was chosen for simplicity
 *      and because the trees are small and the other interpreter
 *      execution overhead is relatively high.
 *
 *      Note: CPU execution analysis has shown that the AML interpreter spends
 *      a very small percentage of its time searching the namespace. Therefore,
 *      the linear search seems to be sufficient, as there would seem to be
 *      little value in improving the search.
