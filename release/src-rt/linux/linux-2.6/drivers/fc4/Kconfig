	---help---
	  Fibre Channel is a high speed serial protocol mainly used to
	  connect large storage devices to the computer; it is compatible with
	  and intended to replace SCSI.

	  This is an experimental support for storage arrays connected to your
	  computer using optical fibre cables and the "X3.269-199X Fibre
	  Channel Protocol for SCSI" specification. If you want to use this,
	  you need to say Y here and to "SCSI support" as well as to the
	  drivers for the storage array itself and for the interface adapter
	  such as SOC or SOC+. This subsystem could even serve for IP
	  networking, with some code extensions.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Serial Optical Channel is an interface card with one or two Fibre
	  Optic ports, each of which can be connected to a disk array. Note
	  that if you have older firmware in the card, you'll need the
	  microcode from the Solaris driver to make it work.

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called soc.

config FC4_SOCAL

	depends on FC4!=n && SPARC
	---help---
	  Serial Optical Channel Plus is an interface card with up to two
	  Fibre Optic ports. This card supports FC Arbitrated Loop (usually
	  A5000 or internal FC disks in E[3-6]000 machines through the
	  Interface Board). You'll probably need the microcode from the
	  Solaris driver to make it work.

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called socal.

	  This driver drives FC-AL disks connected through a Fibre Channel
	  card using the drivers/fc4 layer (currently only SOCAL). The most
	  common is either A5000 array or internal disks in E[3-6]000
	  machines.

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called fcal.
