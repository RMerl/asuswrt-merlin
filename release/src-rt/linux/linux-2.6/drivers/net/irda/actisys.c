 * the signals through the serial port, the dongle being much faster.  Any
 * serial port support 115 kb/s, so we are sure that pulses 8.5 us wide can
 * go through cleanly . If you are on the wild side, you can try to lower
 * this value (Actisys recommended me 2 us, and 0 us work for me on a P233!)

 * up, so by the time we arrive here we should be set. It doesn't hurt
 * to be on the conservative side, so we will wait...
 *	Then, we set the speed to 9600 b/s to get in a known state (see in
 * change_speed for details). It is needed because the IrDA stack
 * has tried to set the speed immediately after our first return,
 * so before we can be sure the dongle is up and running.
