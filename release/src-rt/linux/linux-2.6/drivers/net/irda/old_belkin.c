/*
 * Belkin is selling a dongle called the SmartBeam.
 * In fact, there is two hardware version of this dongle, of course with
 * the same name and looking the exactly same (grrr...).
 * I guess that I've got the old one, because inside I don't have
 * a jumper for IrDA/ASK...
 *
 * As far as I can make it from info on their web site, the old dongle 
 * support only 9600 b/s, which make our life much simpler as far as
 * the driver is concerned, but you might not like it very much ;-)
 * The new SmartBeam does 115 kb/s, and I've not tested it...
 *
 * Belkin claim that the correct driver for the old dongle (in Windows)
 * is the generic Parallax 9500a driver, but the Linux LiteLink driver
 * fails for me (probably because Linux-IrDA doesn't rate fallback),
 * so I created this really dumb driver...
 *
 * In fact, this driver doesn't do much. The only thing it does is to
 * prevent Linux-IrDA to use any other speed than 9600 b/s ;-) This
 * driver is called "old_belkin" so that when the new SmartBeam is supported
 * its driver can be called "belkin" instead of "new_belkin".
 *
 * Note : this driver was written without any info/help from Belkin,
 * so a lot of info here might be totally wrong. Blame me ;-)
