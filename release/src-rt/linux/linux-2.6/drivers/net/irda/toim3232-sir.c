 * Description:   Implementation of dongles based on the Vishay/Temic
 * 		  TOIM3232 SIR Endec chipset. Currently only the
 * 		  IRWave IR320ST-2 is tested, although it should work
 * 		  with any TOIM3232 or TOIM4232 chipset based RS232
 * 		  dongle with minimal modification.
 * 		  Based heavily on the Tekram driver (tekram.c),
 * 		  with thanks to Dag Brattli and Martin Diehl.
 * Status:        Experimental.

/*
 * This driver has currently only been tested on the IRWave IR320ST-2
 *
 * PROTOCOL:
 *
 * The protocol for talking to the TOIM3232 is quite easy, and is
 * designed to interface with RS232 with only level convertors. The
 * BR/~D line on the chip is brought high to signal 'command mode',
 * where a command byte is sent to select the baudrate of the RS232
 * interface and the pulse length of the IRDA output. When BR/~D
 * is brought low, the dongle then changes to the selected baudrate,
 * and the RS232 interface is used for data until BR/~D is brought
 * high again. The initial speed for the TOIMx323 after RESET is
 * 9600 baud.  The baudrate for command-mode is the last selected
 * baud-rate, or 9600 after a RESET.
 *
 * The  dongle I have (below) adds some extra hardware on the front end,
 * but this is mostly directed towards pariasitic power from the RS232
 * line rather than changing very much about how to communicate with
 * the TOIM3232.
 *
 * The protocol to talk to the TOIM4232 chipset seems to be almost
 * identical to the TOIM3232 (and the 4232 datasheet is more detailed)
 * so this code will probably work on that as well, although I haven't
 * tested it on that hardware.
 *
 * Target dongle variations that might be common:
 *
 * DTR and RTS function:
 *   The data sheet for the 4232 has a sample implementation that hooks the
 *   DTR and RTS lines to the RESET and BaudRate/~Data lines of the
 *   chip (through line-converters). Given both DTR and RTS would have to
 *   be held low in normal operation, and the TOIMx232 requires +5V to
 *   signal ground, most dongle designers would almost certainly choose
 *   an implementation that kept at least one of DTR or RTS high in
 *   normal operation to provide power to the dongle, but will likely
 *   vary between designs.
 *
 * User specified command bits:
 *  There are two user-controllable output lines from the TOIMx232 that
 *  can be set low or high by setting the appropriate bits in the
 *  high-nibble of the command byte (when setting speed and pulse length).
 *  These might be used to switch on and off added hardware or extra
 *  dongle features.
 *
 *
 * Target hardware: IRWave IR320ST-2
 *
 * 	The IRWave IR320ST-2 is a simple dongle based on the Vishay/Temic
 * 	TOIM3232 SIR Endec and the Vishay/Temic TFDS4500 SIR IRDA transciever.
 * 	It uses a hex inverter and some discrete components to buffer and
 * 	line convert the RS232 down to 5V.
 *
 * 	The dongle is powered through a voltage regulator, fed by a large
 * 	capacitor. To switch the dongle on, DTR is brought high to charge
 * 	the capacitor and drive the voltage regulator. DTR isn't associated
 * 	with any control lines on the TOIM3232. Parisitic power is also taken
 * 	from the RTS, TD and RD lines when brought high, but through resistors.
 * 	When DTR is low, the circuit might lose power even with RTS high.
 *
 * 	RTS is inverted and attached to the BR/~D input pin. When RTS
 * 	is high, BR/~D is low, and the TOIM3232 is in the normal 'data' mode.
 * 	RTS is brought low, BR/~D is high, and the TOIM3232 is in 'command
 * 	mode'.
 *
 * 	For some unknown reason, the RESET line isn't actually connected
 * 	to anything. This means to reset the dongle to get it to a known
 * 	state (9600 baud) you must drop DTR and RTS low, wait for the power
 * 	capacitor to discharge, and then bring DTR (and RTS for data mode)
 * 	high again, and wait for the capacitor to charge, the power supply
 * 	to stabilise, and the oscillator clock to stabilise.
 *
 * 	Fortunately, if the current baudrate is known, the chipset can
 * 	easily change speed by entering command mode without having to
 * 	reset the dongle first.
 *
 * 	Major Components:
 *
 * 	- Vishay/Temic TOIM3232 SIR Endec to change RS232 pulse timings
 * 	  to IRDA pulse timings
 * 	- 3.6864MHz crystal to drive TOIM3232 clock oscillator
 * 	- DM74lS04M Inverting Hex line buffer for RS232 input buffering
 * 	  and level conversion
 * 	- PJ2951AC 150mA voltage regulator
 * 	- Vishay/Temic TFDS4500	SIR IRDA front-end transceiver

 * 	2. Pull RESET low
 * 	3. Wait for at least 7us
 * 	4. Pull BR/~D high
 * 	5. Wait for at least 7us

 * 	7. Wait at least 1us after stop bit
 * 	8. Pull BR/~D low
 * 	9. Should then be in data mode
 *
 * Because the IR320ST-2 doesn't have the RESET line connected for some reason,
 * we'll have to do something else.
 *
 * The default speed after a RESET is 9600, so lets try just bringing it up in
 * data mode after switching it off, waiting for the supply capacitor to
 * discharge, and then switch it back on. This isn't actually pulling RESET
 * high, but it seems to have the same effect.
 *
 * This behaviour will probably work on dongles that have the RESET line connected,
 * but if not, add a flag for the IR320ST-2, and implment the above-listed proper
 * behaviour.
 *
 * RTS is inverted and then fed to BR/~D, so to put it in programming mode, we
 * need to have pull RTS low
