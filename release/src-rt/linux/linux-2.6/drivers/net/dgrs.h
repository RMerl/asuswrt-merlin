/*
 *	ioctl's for the Digi Intl. RightSwitch
 *
 *	These network driver ioctl's are a bit obtuse compared to the usual
 *	ioctl's for a "normal" device driver.  Hey, I didn't invent it.
 *
 *	Typical use:
 *
 *	struct ifreq	ifr;
 *	DGRS_IOCTL	ioc;
 *	int		x;
 *
 *	strcpy(ifr.ifr_name, "eth1");
 *	ifr.ifr_data = (caddr_t) &ioc;
 *	ioc.cmd = DGRS_GETMEM;
 *	ioc.len = sizeof(x);
 *	ioc.data = (caddr_t) &x;
 *	rc = ioctl(fd, DGRSIOCTL, &ifr);
 *	printf("rc=%d mem=%x\n", rc, x);
