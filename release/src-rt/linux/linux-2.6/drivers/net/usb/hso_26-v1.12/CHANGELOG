v1.12	Jan Dumon
	Added missing Vendor/Product ID's
	Use the port_spec received from the device to create the network device
	instead of a fixed value. The HSO_INFO_CRC_BUG flag could be missed 
	this way.
v1.11	Jan Dumon
	Changed the order of things when stopping the network interface.
	This fixes the crash that still could happen by a hot removal of the device.
v1.10	Jan Dumon
	Set a bunch of pointers to NULL after they were freed.
	This fixes a crash triggered by a hot removal of the device.
v1.9	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Fixed supports_autosuspend in the hso_driver structure 
	to be only defined if the CONFIG_HSO_AUTOPM is defined.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Fixed 2 bugs found by Jeroen Elebaut
	Compiling on 2.6.20 didn't work because my check
	the NETDEV_HAVE_DEV define was out by 1 kernel release
	i.e. the net_device structure didn't have the dev
	member defined till 2.6.21 rather than 2.6.20
	also print_hex_dump_bytes doesn't exist till 2.6.22
	so I had to define a static of this function which does this
	for CONFIG_HSO_DEBUG on kernels prior to 2.6.22
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added 1 liner patch submitted by Oliver Neukum
	which fixed flag marking device was running
	before URBs were submitted in hso_net_open
	which might cause them to complete too early
	& fail to resubmit.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added names of option hso developers to hso.c
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Fixed kernel oops when opening control port,
	as code mistakenly thought it was a modem port 
	& issued a tiocmget_submit_urb to it.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Fixed compile bug when CONFIG_HSO_DEBUG is defined.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Fixed code to compile on 2.6.11
	Fixed incorrect usage of kref_put.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Fixed a bug in hso_connect.sh which had some
	form of italic quotes in the AT+CGDCONT command
	got from a previous bugfix.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Removed retry_unthrottle_workfunc code I accidently
	left lying around.
v1.8	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added safe_usb_unlink_urb & safe_usb_kill_urb
	which check whether a urb is in flight before stopping it.
	kernels prior to 2.6.24 will do a kernel oops if the
	device is disconnected while networking is going on
	if this check isn't done. linux kernels 2.6.24 on do the 
	check if (!urb->ep) return; in usb_kill_urb & usb_submit_urb 
	we cant do this because urb->ep doesn't exist prior to 2.6.24.
        prior to 2.6.23 so we need the -EINPROGRESS check.
	Denis Joseph Barrow 
	Small mod to AT+CGDCONT call in hso_connect.sh
	reported as a bug.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	hso_suspend & hso_resume are used by software suspend
	& suspend to disk as well as autosuspend
	these functions are always defined in
	include/linux/usb.h so I'm leaving them defined in all
	cases for safety as there are several config options
	whose names have been changed between kernel versions
	which may use these function.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added patch by Paulius Zeleckas to set rfkill type to WWAN.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added some new device id's supported by the hso driver.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added Johnathan McDowells from patch which prevents an oops crash 
	in rfkill from netdev@vger.kernel.org.
	Denis Joseph Barrow 
	Moved serial_open_count in hso_serial_open to
	prevent crashes owing to the serial structure being made NULL
	when hso_serial_close is called even though hso_serial_open
	returned -ENODEV also put in sanity check in hso_serial_close
	to check for a valid serial structure which should prevent
	the most reproducable crash in the driver when the hso device
	is disconnected while in use.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added Data Carrier Detect etc. to hso_tiocmget.
	Took out /proc filesystem hso related stuff to force
	connection manager developers to use /sys filesystem stuff.
	Made function of common code which made ttyHSx /proc filesystem
	entries for mux & bulk serial devices.
v1.7    Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added back old procfs entries so that legacy versions
	of connection managers still work.
	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Added Joffry Bellavia's port.sh script.
	which locates application,diagnostic & control ports
	for the user.
v1.6	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Put MOD_INFO back to show if CONFIG_HSO_AUTOPM & CONFIG_HSO_DEBUG
        is set or not removed warning about disabling CONFIG_HSO_AUTOPM if
        the kernel version is too old, also fixed some sloppyness found
	by Peter Henn.

	Fixed compile bug which left reset_resume method
	defined for kernels prior to 2.6.22 where it didn't exist.
v1.5    Denis Joseph Barrow
	Updated README

	Applied Adrian Bunks hso_create_bulk_serial_device(): 
	fix of a double free patch from the linux-usb mailing list.

	Made usb_drivers reset_resume function point to
	hso_resume this fixes problems when the network
	interface is left idle for a few minutes.
	Possibly reset_resume should initialise hardware
        more but this works in the common case.

        Added check for IFF_UP in hso_resume this should
        eliminate -EINVAL (-22) errors caused from
        urb's being submitted twice once by hso_resume
        & once in hso_net_open if suspend/resume USB power saving
	mode is enabled.

        Added s setpwr.sh script so that USB power saving mode can
        be switched on or off quickly in the driver without having
        to walk through sysfs.

        Removed usb_driver_claim_interface & usb_driver_release_interface
        calls as they were deemed by Paulius Zaleckas on the
        linux usb mailing list to be unneccessary.

        Improved hso_connect.sh script to make it automatically
        detect the application port.
        Improved hso_connect.sh so that it automatically finds
        the application port.

	Removed usb_driver_claim_interface & usb_driver_release_interface
	calls as they were deemed by Paulius Zaleckas on the
	linux usb mailing list to be unneccessary.

v1.5-rc1 Denis Joseph Barrow
	Took updates upto 2.6.27-rc5,
	A new structure hso_mutex_table had to be declared statically
	& used as as hso_device mutex_lock(&serial->parent->mutex) etc
	is freed in hso_serial_open & hso_serial_close by kref_put while
	the mutex is still in use.
	This is a substantial change but should make the driver much stabler.
	Patch to stop loss of characters on the hso modems,
	this patch throttles & unthrottles the modem by
	not putting out urbs until the tty/line discipline layer
	has enough space for newly received packets.
	serial ports. This is required for firmware diagnostics
	being done at Option.

v2.6.27-rc3 Denis Joseph Barrow
	Taking code directly from 2.6.27-rc3 will be using
	the official linux kernel version as a basis for
	our future releases & porting our bugfixes onto this.

	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Fixed a problem found by a firmware engineer, the
	program basically in hso_std_serial_write_bulk_callback was being
	not sanity checking serial->tty was not NULL before calling tty_wakeup
	this resulted in a race condition where urbs  after
    	serial->tty was shut down. maybe more needs to be done here.

    	Moved kref_put in hso_serial_close as refcnt was incorrectly
    	going to zero  when serial->open_count went to zero
    	which was not consistent with hso_serial_open.
	A similar patch was posted to the linux usb mailing list.

	
1.4     Denis Joseph Barrow
        Fixed dev_kfree_skb happening too many times when hso_start_net_device
        is called from hso_resume. This manifests itself as a crash after a
        kernel message saying that the hso driver is transmitting lingering data
    
        Renamed hso driver printk macros to have a prefix HSO_ this
        was needed as the kernel also defines a macro called WARN in 2.6.27-rc1
        which hso.h also defined.
    
        Fixed a tty line stuff needed to compile for 2.6.27-rc1
    
        Made calls to hso_mux_submit_intr_urb use GFP_ATOMIC in their
        allocations like the 2.6.27-rc1 driver this prevents the kernel
        trying to sleep while in interrupt.
