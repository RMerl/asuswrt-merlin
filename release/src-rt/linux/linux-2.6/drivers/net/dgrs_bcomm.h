/*
 * The bios low-memory structure
 *
 * Some of the variables in here can be used to set parameters that
 * are stored in NVRAM and will retain their old values the next time
 * the card is brought up.  To use the values stored in NVRAM, the
 * parameter should be set to "all ones".  This tells the firmware to
 * use the NVRAM value or a suitable default.  The value that is used
 * will be stored back into this structure by the firmware.  If the
 * value of the variable is not "all ones", then that value will be
 * used and will be stored into NVRAM if it isn't already there.
 * The variables this applies to are the following:
 *	Variable	Set to:		Gets default of:
 *	bc_hashexpire	-1		300	(5 minutes)
 *	bc_spantree	-1		1	(spanning tree on)
 *	bc_ipaddr	FF:FF:FF:FF	0	(no SNMP IP address)
 *	bc_ipxnet	FF:FF:FF:FF	0	(no SNMP IPX net)
 *	bc_iptrap	FF:FF:FF:FF	0	(no SNMP IP trap address)
 *
 * Some variables MUST have their value set after the firmware
 * is loaded onto the board, but before the processor is released.
 * These are:
 *	bc_host		0 means no host "port", run as standalone switch.
 *			1 means run as a switch, with a host port. (normal)
 *			2 means run as multiple NICs, not as a switch.
 *			-1 means run in diagnostics mode.
 *	bc_nowait
 *	bc_hostarea_len
 *	bc_filter_len
 *
