config IBM_ASM
	tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
	depends on X86 && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
	  a user space API.
	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
	  service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of
	  this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be
	  enabled.

	  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function
	  correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven
	  website <http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/eserver/xseries/serverproven> for
	  information on the specific driver level and support statement
	  for your IBM server.

config PHANTOM
	tristate "Sensable PHANToM"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build a driver for Sensable PHANToM device.

	  If you choose to build module, its name will be phantom. If unsure,
	  say N here.


	  If unsure, say N.

config SGI_IOC4
	tristate "SGI IOC4 Base IO support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This option enables basic support for the IOC4 chip on certain
	  SGI IO controller cards (IO9, IO10, and PCI-RT).  This option
	  does not enable any specific functions on such a card, but provides
	  necessary infrastructure for other drivers to utilize.

	  If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC4-based card say Y.
	  Otherwise say N.

config TIFM_CORE
	tristate "TI Flash Media interface support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PCI
	help
	  If you want support for Texas Instruments(R) Flash Media adapters
	  you should select this option and then also choose an appropriate
	  host adapter, such as 'TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter
	  support', if you have a TI PCI74xx compatible card reader, for
	  example.
	  You will also have to select some flash card format drivers. MMC/SD
	  cards are supported via 'MMC/SD Card support: TI Flash Media MMC/SD
	  Interface support (MMC_TIFM_SD)'.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called tifm_core.

config TIFM_7XX1
	tristate "TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && TIFM_CORE && EXPERIMENTAL
	default TIFM_CORE
	help
	  This option enables support for Texas Instruments(R) PCI74xx and
	  PCI76xx families of Flash Media adapters, found in many laptops.
	  To make actual use of the device, you will have to select some
	  flash card format drivers, as outlined in the TIFM_CORE Help.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called tifm_7xx1.

config ASUS_LAPTOP
        tristate "Asus Laptop Extras (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on X86
        depends on ACPI
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && !ACPI_ASUS
	depends on LEDS_CLASS
	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
        ---help---
	  This is the new Linux driver for Asus laptops. It may also support some
	  MEDION, JVC or VICTOR laptops. It makes all the extra buttons generate
	  standard ACPI events that go through /proc/acpi/events. It also adds
	  support for video output switching, LCD backlight control, Bluetooth and
	  Wlan control, and most importantly, allows you to blink those fancy LEDs.

	  For more information and a userspace daemon for handling the extra
	  buttons see <http://acpi4asus.sf.net/>.

	  If you have an ACPI-compatible ASUS laptop, say Y or M here.

config MSI_LAPTOP

	  INTERNATIONAL):

	  MSI MegaBook S270 (MS-1013)
	  Cytron/TCM/Medion/Tchibo MD96100/SAM2000

	  It adds support for Bluetooth, WLAN and LCD brightness control.

	  More information about this driver is available at
	  <http://0pointer.de/lennart/tchibo.html>.

	  If you have an MSI S270 laptop, say Y or M here.

config SONY_LAPTOP
	tristate "Sony Laptop Extras"

	select BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
	  ---help---
	  This mini-driver drives the SNC and SPIC devices present in the ACPI
	  BIOS of the Sony Vaio laptops.

	  It gives access to some extra laptop functionalities like Bluetooth,
	  screen brightness control, Fn keys and allows powering on/off some
	  devices.

	  Read <file:Documentation/sony-laptop.txt> for more information.

config SONYPI_COMPAT
	bool "Sonypi compatibility"
	depends on SONY_LAPTOP

	select BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
	select HWMON
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. It adds
	  support for Fn-Fx key combinations, Bluetooth control, video
	  output switching, ThinkLight control, UltraBay eject and more.
	  For more information about this driver see 
	  <file:Documentation/thinkpad-acpi.txt> and <http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/> .

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debug mode"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables extra debugging information, at the expense of a slightly
	  increase in driver size.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DOCK
	bool "Legacy Docking Station Support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	depends on ACPI_DOCK=n
	default n
	---help---
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to handle docking station events.
	  This support was made obsolete by the generic ACPI docking station
	  support (CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK).  It will allow locking and removing the
	  laptop from the docking station, but will not properly connect PCI
	  devices.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_BAY
	bool "Legacy Removable Bay Support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
