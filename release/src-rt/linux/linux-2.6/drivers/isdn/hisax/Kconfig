	  This is a driver supporting the Siemens chipset on various
	  ISDN-cards (like AVM A1, Elsa ISDN cards, Teles S0-16.0, Teles
	  S0-16.3, Teles S0-8, Teles/Creatix PnP, ITK micro ix1 and many
	  compatibles).

	  HiSax is just the name of this driver, not the name of any hardware.

	  If you have a card with such a chipset, you should say Y here and
	  also to the configuration option of the driver for your particular
	  card, below.
