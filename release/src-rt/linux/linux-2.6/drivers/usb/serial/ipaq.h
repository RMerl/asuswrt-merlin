/*
 * Since we can't queue our bulk write urbs (don't know why - it just
 * doesn't work), we can send down only one write urb at a time. The simplistic
 * approach taken by the generic usbserial driver will work, but it's not good
 * for performance. Therefore, we buffer upto URBDATA_QUEUE_MAX bytes of write
 * requests coming from the line discipline. This is done by chaining them
 * in lists of struct ipaq_packet, each packet holding a maximum of
 * PACKET_SIZE bytes.
 *
 * ipaq_write() can be called from bottom half context; hence we can't
 * allocate memory for packets there. So we initialize a pool of packets at
 * the first open and maintain a freelist.
 *
 * The value of PACKET_SIZE was empirically determined by
 * checking the maximum write sizes sent down by the ppp ldisc.
 * URBDATA_QUEUE_MAX is set to 64K, which is the maximum TCP window size.
