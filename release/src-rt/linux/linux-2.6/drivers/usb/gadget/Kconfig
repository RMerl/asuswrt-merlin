# USB Gadget support on a system involves
#    (a) a peripheral controller, and
#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of controllers.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).

menuconfig USB_GADGET
	tristate "USB Gadget Support"
	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	   For more information, see <http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget> and
	   the kernel DocBook documentation for this API.

	   Many controller and gadget drivers will print some debugging
	   messages if you use this option to ask for those messages.

	   Avoid enabling these messages, even if you're actively
	   debugging such a driver.  Many drivers will emit so many

	   Some devices need to draw power from USB when they are

	   Enter the maximum power your device draws through USB, in
	   milliAmperes.  The permitted range of values is 2 - 500 mA;
	   0 mA would be legal, but can make some hosts misbehave.

	   This value will be used except for system-specific gadget
	   drivers that have more specific information.

	  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,

	  This driver implements Ethernet style communication, in one of
	  several ways:
	  
	   - The "Communication Device Class" (CDC) Ethernet Control Model.
	     That protocol is often avoided with pure Ethernet adapters, in
	     favor of simpler vendor-specific hardware, but is widely
	     supported by firmware for smart network devices.

	   - On hardware can't implement that protocol, a simple CDC subset
	     is used, placing fewer demands on USB.

	   - CDC Ethernet Emulation Model (EEM) is a newer standard that has
	     a simpler interface that can be used by more USB hardware.

	  RNDIS support is an additional option, more demanding than than
	  subset.

	  Within the USB device, this gadget driver exposes a network device
	  "usbX", where X depends on what other networking devices you have.
	  Treat it like a two-node Ethernet link:  host, and gadget.

	  The Linux-USB host-side "usbnet" driver interoperates with this
	  driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  On 2.4 kernels,
	  use "CDCEther" instead, if you're using the CDC option. That CDC
	  mode should also interoperate with standard CDC Ethernet class
	  drivers on other host operating systems.

	  Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
	  dynamically linked module called "g_ether".

	   Microsoft Windows XP bundles the "Remote NDIS" (RNDIS) protocol,

	   If you say "y" here, the Ethernet gadget driver will try to provide
	   a second device configuration, supporting RNDIS to talk to such
	   Microsoft USB hosts.
	   
	   To make MS-Windows work with this, use Documentation/usb/linux.inf

config USB_ETH_EEM

       default n
       help
         CDC EEM is a newer USB standard that is somewhat simpler than CDC ECM
         and therefore can be supported by more hardware.  Technically ECM and
         EEM are designed for different applications.  The ECM model extends
         the network interface to the target (e.g. a USB cable modem), and the
         EEM model is for mobile devices to communicate with hosts using
         ethernet over USB.  For Linux gadgets, however, the interface with
         the host is the same (a usbX device), so the differences are minimal.

         If you say "y" here, the Ethernet gadget driver will use the EEM
         protocol rather than ECM.  If unsure, say "n".
