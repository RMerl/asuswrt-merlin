 * High level machine check handler. Handles pages reported by the
 * hardware as being corrupted usually due to a multi-bit ECC memory or cache
 * failure.
 * 
 * In addition there is a "soft offline" entry point that allows stop using
 * not-yet-corrupted-by-suspicious pages without killing anything.
 *
 * Handles page cache pages in various states.	The tricky part
 * here is that we can access any page asynchronously in respect to 
 * other VM users, because memory failures could happen anytime and 
 * anywhere. This could violate some of their assumptions. This is why 
 * this code has to be extremely careful. Generally it tries to use 
 * normal locking rules, as in get the standard locks, even if that means 
 * the error handling takes potentially a long time.
 * 
 * There are several operations here with exponential complexity because
 * of unsuitable VM data structures. For example the operation to map back 
 * from RMAP chains to processes has to walk the complete process list and 
 * has non linear complexity with the number. But since memory corruptions
 * are rare we hope to get away with this. This avoids impacting the core 
 * VM.
