 * This is an older type of interface for self programming flash. It is
 * commonly use in older AMD chips and is obsolete compared with CFI.
 * It is called JEDEC because the JEDEC association distributes the ID codes
 * for the chips.
 *
 * See the AMD flash databook for information on how to operate the interface.
