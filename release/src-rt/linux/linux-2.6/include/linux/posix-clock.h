 * struct posix_clock_operations - functional interface to the clock
 *
 * Every posix clock is represented by a character device. Drivers may
 * optionally offer extended capabilities by implementing the
 * character device methods. The character device file operations are
 * first handled by the clock device layer, then passed on to the
 * driver by calling these functions.
 *
 * @owner:          The clock driver should set to THIS_MODULE
 * @clock_adjtime:  Adjust the clock
 * @clock_gettime:  Read the current time
 * @clock_getres:   Get the clock resolution
 * @clock_settime:  Set the current time value
 * @timer_create:   Create a new timer
 * @timer_delete:   Remove a previously created timer
 * @timer_gettime:  Get remaining time and interval of a timer
 * @timer_setttime: Set a timer's initial expiration and interval
 * @fasync:         Optional character device fasync method
 * @mmap:           Optional character device mmap method
 * @open:           Optional character device open method
 * @release:        Optional character device release method
 * @ioctl:          Optional character device ioctl method
 * @read:           Optional character device read method
