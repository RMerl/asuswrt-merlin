/**
 * struct i2c_gpio_platform_data - Platform-dependent data for i2c-gpio
 * @sda_pin: GPIO pin ID to use for SDA
 * @scl_pin: GPIO pin ID to use for SCL
 * @udelay: signal toggle delay. SCL frequency is (500 / udelay) kHz
 * @timeout: clock stretching timeout in jiffies. If the slave keeps
 *	SCL low for longer than this, the transfer will time out.
 * @sda_is_open_drain: SDA is configured as open drain, i.e. the pin
 *	isn't actively driven high when setting the output value high.
 *	gpio_get_value() must return the actual pin state even if the
 *	pin is configured as an output.
 * @scl_is_open_drain: SCL is set up as open drain. Same requirements
 *	as for sda_is_open_drain apply.
 * @scl_is_output_only: SCL output drivers cannot be turned off.
