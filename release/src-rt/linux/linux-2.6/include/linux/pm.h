/**
 * struct dev_pm_ops - device PM callbacks
 *
 * Several driver power state transitions are externally visible, affecting
 * the state of pending I/O queues and (for drivers that touch hardware)
 * interrupts, wakeups, DMA, and other hardware state.  There may also be
 * internal transitions to various low power modes, which are transparent
 * to the rest of the driver stack (such as a driver that's ON gating off
 * clocks which are not in active use).
 *
 * The externally visible transitions are handled with the help of the following
 * callbacks included in this structure:
 *
 * @prepare: Prepare the device for the upcoming transition, but do NOT change
 *	its hardware state.  Prevent new children of the device from being
 *	registered after @prepare() returns (the driver's subsystem and
 *	generally the rest of the kernel is supposed to prevent new calls to the
 *	probe method from being made too once @prepare() has succeeded).  If
 *	@prepare() detects a situation it cannot handle (e.g. registration of a
 *	child already in progress), it may return -EAGAIN, so that the PM core
 *	can execute it once again (e.g. after the new child has been registered)
 *	to recover from the race condition.  This method is executed for all
 *	kinds of suspend transitions and is followed by one of the suspend
 *	callbacks: @suspend(), @freeze(), or @poweroff().
 *	The PM core executes @prepare() for all devices before starting to
 *	execute suspend callbacks for any of them, so drivers may assume all of
 *	the other devices to be present and functional while @prepare() is being
 *	executed.  In particular, it is safe to make GFP_KERNEL memory
 *	allocations from within @prepare().  However, drivers may NOT assume
 *	anything about the availability of the user space at that time and it
 *	is not correct to request firmware from within @prepare() (it's too
 *	late to do that).  [To work around this limitation, drivers may
 *	register suspend and hibernation notifiers that are executed before the
 *	freezing of tasks.]
 *
 * @complete: Undo the changes made by @prepare().  This method is executed for
 *	all kinds of resume transitions, following one of the resume callbacks:
 *	@resume(), @thaw(), @restore().  Also called if the state transition
 *	fails before the driver's suspend callback (@suspend(), @freeze(),
 *	@poweroff()) can be executed (e.g. if the suspend callback fails for one
 *	of the other devices that the PM core has unsuccessfully attempted to
 *	suspend earlier).
 *	The PM core executes @complete() after it has executed the appropriate
 *	resume callback for all devices.
 *
 * @suspend: Executed before putting the system into a sleep state in which the
 *	contents of main memory are preserved.  Quiesce the device, put it into
 *	a low power state appropriate for the upcoming system state (such as
 *	PCI_D3hot), and enable wakeup events as appropriate.
 *
 * @resume: Executed after waking the system up from a sleep state in which the
 *	contents of main memory were preserved.  Put the device into the
 *	appropriate state, according to the information saved in memory by the
 *	preceding @suspend().  The driver starts working again, responding to
 *	hardware events and software requests.  The hardware may have gone
 *	through a power-off reset, or it may have maintained state from the
 *	previous suspend() which the driver may rely on while resuming.  On most
 *	platforms, there are no restrictions on availability of resources like
 *	clocks during @resume().
 *
 * @freeze: Hibernation-specific, executed before creating a hibernation image.
 *	Quiesce operations so that a consistent image can be created, but do NOT
 *	otherwise put the device into a low power device state and do NOT emit
 *	system wakeup events.  Save in main memory the device settings to be
 *	used by @restore() during the subsequent resume from hibernation or by
 *	the subsequent @thaw(), if the creation of the image or the restoration
 *	of main memory contents from it fails.
 *
 * @thaw: Hibernation-specific, executed after creating a hibernation image OR
 *	if the creation of the image fails.  Also executed after a failing
 *	attempt to restore the contents of main memory from such an image.
 *	Undo the changes made by the preceding @freeze(), so the device can be
 *	operated in the same way as immediately before the call to @freeze().
 *
 * @poweroff: Hibernation-specific, executed after saving a hibernation image.
 *	Quiesce the device, put it into a low power state appropriate for the
 *	upcoming system state (such as PCI_D3hot), and enable wakeup events as
 *	appropriate.
 *
 * @restore: Hibernation-specific, executed after restoring the contents of main
 *	memory from a hibernation image.  Driver starts working again,
 *	responding to hardware events and software requests.  Drivers may NOT
 *	make ANY assumptions about the hardware state right prior to @restore().
 *	On most platforms, there are no restrictions on availability of
 *	resources like clocks during @restore().
 *
 * @suspend_noirq: Complete the operations of ->suspend() by carrying out any
 *	actions required for suspending the device that need interrupts to be
 *	disabled
 *
 * @resume_noirq: Prepare for the execution of ->resume() by carrying out any
 *	actions required for resuming the device that need interrupts to be
 *	disabled
 *
 * @freeze_noirq: Complete the operations of ->freeze() by carrying out any
 *	actions required for freezing the device that need interrupts to be
 *	disabled
 *
 * @thaw_noirq: Prepare for the execution of ->thaw() by carrying out any
 *	actions required for thawing the device that need interrupts to be
 *	disabled
 *
 * @poweroff_noirq: Complete the operations of ->poweroff() by carrying out any
 *	actions required for handling the device that need interrupts to be
 *	disabled
 *
 * @restore_noirq: Prepare for the execution of ->restore() by carrying out any
 *	actions required for restoring the operations of the device that need
 *	interrupts to be disabled
 *
 * All of the above callbacks, except for @complete(), return error codes.
 * However, the error codes returned by the resume operations, @resume(),
 * @thaw(), @restore(), @resume_noirq(), @thaw_noirq(), and @restore_noirq() do
 * not cause the PM core to abort the resume transition during which they are
 * returned.  The error codes returned in that cases are only printed by the PM
 * core to the system logs for debugging purposes.  Still, it is recommended
 * that drivers only return error codes from their resume methods in case of an
 * unrecoverable failure (i.e. when the device being handled refuses to resume
 * and becomes unusable) to allow us to modify the PM core in the future, so
 * that it can avoid attempting to handle devices that failed to resume and
 * their children.
 *
 * It is allowed to unregister devices while the above callbacks are being
 * executed.  However, it is not allowed to unregister a device from within any
 * of its own callbacks.
 *
 * There also are the following callbacks related to run-time power management
 * of devices:
 *
 * @runtime_suspend: Prepare the device for a condition in which it won't be
 *	able to communicate with the CPU(s) and RAM due to power management.
 *	This need not mean that the device should be put into a low power state.
 *	For example, if the device is behind a link which is about to be turned
 *	off, the device may remain at full power.  If the device does go to low
 *	power and is capable of generating run-time wake-up events, remote
 *	wake-up (i.e., a hardware mechanism allowing the device to request a
 *	change of its power state via a wake-up event, such as PCI PME) should
 *	be enabled for it.
 *
 * @runtime_resume: Put the device into the fully active state in response to a
 *	wake-up event generated by hardware or at the request of software.  If
 *	necessary, put the device into the full power state and restore its
 *	registers, so that it is fully operational.
 *
 * @runtime_idle: Device appears to be inactive and it might be put into a low
 *	power state if all of the necessary conditions are satisfied.  Check
 *	these conditions and handle the device as appropriate, possibly queueing
 *	a suspend request for it.  The return value is ignored by the PM core.

 * That commonly entails turning off IRQs and DMA; there may be rules
 * about how to quiesce that are specific to the bus or the device's type.
 * (For example, network drivers mark the link state.)  Other details may

 *
 * SUSPEND	Quiesce, enter a low power device state appropriate for

 * HIBERNATE	Enter a low power device state appropriate for the hibernation

 *
 * PRETHAW	Quiesce as if for FREEZE; additionally, prepare for restoring
