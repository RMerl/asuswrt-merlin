 * Reader/writer consistent mechanism without starving writers. This type of
 * lock for data where the reader wants a consistent set of information
 * and is willing to retry if the information changes.  Readers never
 * block but they may have to retry if a writer is in
 * progress. Writers do not wait for readers. 
 *
 * This is not as cache friendly as brlock. Also, this will not work
 * for data that contains pointers, because any writer could
 * invalidate a pointer that a reader was following.
 *
 * Expected reader usage:
 * 	do {
 *	    seq = read_seqbegin(&foo);
 * 	...
 *      } while (read_seqretry(&foo, seq));
 *
 *
 * On non-SMP the spin locks disappear but the writer still needs
 * to increment the sequence variables because an interrupt routine could
 * change the state of the data.
 *
 * Based on x86_64 vsyscall gettimeofday 
 * by Keith Owens and Andrea Arcangeli
