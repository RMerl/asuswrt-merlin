/* Calculate counter clock-divider and count values to attain the
   desired frequency RATE from the base frequency BASE_FREQ.  The
   counter is expected to have a clock-divider, which can divide the
   system cpu clock by a power of two value from MIN_DIVLOG2 to
   MAX_DIV_LOG2, and a word-size of COUNTER_SIZE bits (the counter
   counts up and resets whenever it's equal to the compare register,
   generating an interrupt or whatever when it does so).  The returned
   values are: *DIVLOG2 -- log2 of the desired clock divider and *COUNT
   -- the counter compare value to use.  Returns true if it was possible
   to find a reasonable value, otherwise false (and the other return
   values will be set to be as good as possible).  */
