 * Read-write spinlocks, allowing multiple readers but only one writer.

 * In the PA-RISC implementation, we have a spinlock and a counter.
 * Readers use the lock to serialise their access to the counter (which
 * records how many readers currently hold the lock).
 * Writers hold the spinlock, preventing any readers or other writers from
