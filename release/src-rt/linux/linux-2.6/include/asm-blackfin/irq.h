/*******************************************************************************
 *****   INTRODUCTION ***********
 *   On the Blackfin, the interrupt structure allows remmapping of the hardware
 *   levels.
 * - I'm going to assume that the H/W level is going to stay at the default
 *   settings. If someone wants to go through and abstart this out, feel free
 *   to mod the interrupt numbering scheme.
 * - I'm abstracting the interrupts so that uClinux does not know anything
 *   about the H/W levels. If you want to change the H/W AND keep the abstracted
 *   levels that uClinux sees, you should be able to do most of it here.
 * - I've left the "abstract" numbering sparce in case someone wants to pull the
 *   interrupts apart (just the TX/RX for the various devices)

 * Machine specific interrupt sources.
 *
 * Adding an interrupt service routine for a source with this bit
 * set indicates a special machine specific interrupt source.
 * The machine specific files define these sources.
 *
 * The IRQ_MACHSPEC bit is now gone - the only thing it did was to
 * introduce unnecessary overhead.
 *
 * All interrupt handling is actually machine specific so it is better
 * to use function pointers, as used by the Sparc port, and select the
 * interrupt handling functions when initializing the kernel. This way
 * we save some unnecessary overhead at run-time.
