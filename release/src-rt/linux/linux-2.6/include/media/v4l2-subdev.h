/* Sub-devices are devices that are connected somehow to the main bridge
   device. These devices are usually audio/video muxers/encoders/decoders or
   sensors and webcam controllers.

   Usually these devices are controlled through an i2c bus, but other busses
   may also be used.

   The v4l2_subdev struct provides a way of accessing these devices in a
   generic manner. Most operations that these sub-devices support fall in
   a few categories: core ops, audio ops, video ops and tuner ops.

   More categories can be added if needed, although this should remain a
   limited set (no more than approx. 8 categories).

   Each category has its own set of ops that subdev drivers can implement.

   A subdev driver can leave the pointer to the category ops NULL if
   it does not implement them (e.g. an audio subdev will generally not
   implement the video category ops). The exception is the core category:
   this must always be present.

   These ops are all used internally so it is no problem to change, remove
   or add ops or move ops from one to another category. Currently these
   ops are based on the original ioctls, but since ops are not limited to
   one argument there is room for improvement here once all i2c subdev
   drivers are converted to use these ops.
 */

/* Core ops: it is highly recommended to implement at least these ops:

   g_chip_ident
   log_status
   g_register
   s_register

   This provides basic debugging support.

   The ioctl ops is meant for generic ioctl-like commands. Depending on
   the use-case it might be better to use subdev-specific ops (currently
   not yet implemented) since ops provide proper type-checking.
 */

/* s_config: if set, then it is always called by the v4l2_i2c_new_subdev*
	functions after the v4l2_subdev was registered. It is used to pass
	platform data to the subdev which can be used during initialization.

   init: initialize the sensor registors to some sort of reasonable default
	values. Do not use for new drivers and should be removed in existing
	drivers.

   load_fw: load firmware.

   reset: generic reset command. The argument selects which subsystems to
	reset. Passing 0 will always reset the whole chip. Do not use for new
	drivers without discussing this first on the linux-media mailinglist.
	There should be no reason normally to reset a device.

   s_gpio: set GPIO pins. Very simple right now, might need to be extended with
	a direction argument if needed.

   decode_vbi_line: video decoders that support sliced VBI need to implement
	this ioctl. Field p of the v4l2_sliced_vbi_line struct is set to the
	start of the VBI data that was generated by the decoder. The driver
	then parses the sliced VBI data and sets the other fields in the
	struct accordingly. The pointer p is updated to point to the start of
	the payload which can be copied verbatim into the data field of the
	v4l2_sliced_vbi_data struct. If no valid VBI data was found, then the
	type field is set to 0 on return.

   s_vbi_data: used to generate VBI signals on a video signal.
	v4l2_sliced_vbi_data is filled with the data packets that should be
	output. Note that if you set the line field to 0, then that VBI signal
	is disabled. If no valid VBI data was found, then the type field is
	set to 0 on return.

   g_vbi_data: used to obtain the sliced VBI packet from a readback register.
	Not all video decoders support this. If no data is available because
	the readback register contains invalid or erroneous data -EIO is
	returned. Note that you must fill in the 'id' member and the 'field'
	member (to determine whether CC data from the first or second field
	should be obtained).

   s_std_output: set v4l2_std_id for video OUTPUT devices. This is ignored by
	video input devices.

  s_crystal_freq: sets the frequency of the crystal used to generate the
	clocks in Hz. An extra flags field allows device specific configuration
	regarding clock frequency dividers, etc. If not used, then set flags
	to 0. If the frequency is not supported, then -EINVAL is returned.
