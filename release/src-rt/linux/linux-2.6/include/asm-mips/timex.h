/*
 * This is the frequency of the timer used for Linux's timer interrupt.
 * The value should be defined as accurate as possible or under certain
 * circumstances Linux timekeeping might become inaccurate or fail.
 *
 * For many system the exact clockrate of the timer isn't known but due to
 * the way this value is used we can get away with a wrong value as long
 * as this value is:
 *
 *  - a multiple of HZ
 *  - a divisor of the actual rate
 *
 * 500000 is a good such cheat value.
 *
 * The obscure number 1193182 is the same as used by the original i8254
 * time in legacy PC hardware; the chip unfortunately also found in a
 * bunch of MIPS systems.  The last remaining user of the i8254 for the
 * timer interrupt is the RM200; it's a very standard system so there is
 * no reason to make this a separate architecture.
