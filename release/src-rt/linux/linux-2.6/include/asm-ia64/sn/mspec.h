 * Each Atomic Memory Operation (AMO formerly known as fetchop)
 * variable is 64 bytes long.  The first 8 bytes are used.  The
 * remaining 56 bytes are unaddressable due to the operation taking
 * that portion of the address.
 *
 * NOTE: The AMO_t _MUST_ be placed in either the first or second half
 * of the cache line.  The cache line _MUST NOT_ be used for anything
 * other than additional AMO_t entries.  This is because there are two
 * addresses which reference the same physical cache line.  One will
 * be a cached entry with the memory type bits all set.  This address
 * may be loaded into processor cache.  The AMO_t will be referenced
 * uncached via the memory special memory type.  If any portion of the
 * cached cache-line is modified, when that line is flushed, it will
 * overwrite the uncached value in physical memory and lead to
 * inconsistency.
