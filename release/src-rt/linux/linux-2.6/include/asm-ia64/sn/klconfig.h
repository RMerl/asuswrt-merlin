 * The KLCONFIG area is organized as a LINKED LIST of BOARDs. A BOARD
 * can be either 'LOCAL' or 'REMOTE'. LOCAL means it is attached to 
 * the LOCAL/current NODE. REMOTE means it is attached to a different
 * node.(TBD - Need a way to treat ROUTER boards.)
 *
 * There are 2 different structures to represent these boards -
 * lboard - Local board, rboard - remote board. These 2 structures
 * can be arbitrarily mixed in the LINKED LIST of BOARDs. (Refer
 * Figure below). The first byte of the rboard or lboard structure
 * is used to find out its type - no unions are used.
 * If it is a lboard, then the config info of this board will be found
 * on the local node. (LOCAL NODE BASE + offset value gives pointer to 
 * the structure.
 * If it is a rboard, the local structure contains the node number
 * and the offset of the beginning of the LINKED LIST on the remote node.
 * The details of the hardware on a remote node can be built locally,
 * if required, by reading the LINKED LIST on the remote node and 
 * ignoring all the rboards on that node.
 *
 * The local node uses the REMOTE NODE NUMBER + OFFSET to point to the 
 * First board info on the remote node. The remote node list is 
 * traversed as the local list, using the REMOTE BASE ADDRESS and not
 * the local base address and ignoring all rboard values.

 *
 * Each BOARD consists of COMPONENTs and the BOARD structure has 
 * pointers (offsets) to its COMPONENT structure.
 * The COMPONENT structure has version info, size and speed info, revision,
 * error info and the NIC info. This structure can accommodate any
 * BOARD with arbitrary COMPONENT composition.
 *
 * The ERRORINFO part of each BOARD has error information
 * that describes errors about the BOARD itself. It also has flags to
 * indicate the COMPONENT(s) on the board that have errors. The error 
 * information specific to the COMPONENT is present in the respective 
 * COMPONENT structure.
 *
 * The ERRORINFO structure is also treated like a COMPONENT, ie. the 
 * BOARD has pointers(offset) to the ERRORINFO structure. The rboard
 * structure also has a pointer to the ERRORINFO structure. This is 
 * the place to store ERRORINFO about a REMOTE NODE, if the HUB on
 * that NODE is not working or if the REMOTE MEMORY is BAD. In cases where 
 * only the CPU of the REMOTE NODE is disabled, the ERRORINFO pointer can
 * be a NODE NUMBER, REMOTE OFFSET combination, pointing to error info 
 * which is present on the REMOTE NODE.(TBD)
 * REMOTE ERRINFO can be stored on any of the nearest nodes 
 * or on all the nearest nodes.(TBD)
 * Like BOARD structures, REMOTE ERRINFO structures can be built locally
 * using the rboard errinfo pointer.
 *
 * In order to get useful information from this Data organization, a set of
 * interface routines are provided (TBD). The important thing to remember while
 * manipulating the structures, is that, the NODE number information should
 * be used. If the NODE is non-zero (remote) then each offset should
 * be added to the REMOTE BASE ADDR else it should be added to the LOCAL BASE ADDR. 
 * This includes offsets for BOARDS, COMPONENTS and ERRORINFO.
 * 
 * Note that these structures do not provide much info about connectivity.
 * That info will be part of HWGRAPH, which is an extension of the cfg_t
 * data structure. (ref IP27prom/cfg.h) It has to be extended to include
 * the IO part of the Network(TBD).
 *
 * The data structures below define the above concepts.
