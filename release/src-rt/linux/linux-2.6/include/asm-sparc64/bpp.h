/*
 * This is a driver that supports IEEE Std 1284-1994 communications
 * with compliant or compatible devices. It will use whatever features
 * the device supports, prefering those that are typically faster.
 *
 * When the device is opened, it is left in COMPATIBILITY mode, and
 * writes work like any printer device. The driver only attempt to
 * negotiate 1284 modes when needed so that plugs can be pulled,
 * switch boxes switched, etc., without disrupting things. It will
 * also leave the device in compatibility mode when closed.

/*
 * This driver also supplies ioctls to manually manipulate the
 * pins. This is great for testing devices, or writing code to deal
 * with bizzarro-mode of the ACME Special TurboThingy Plus.
 *
 * NOTE: These ioctl currently do not interact well with
 * read/write. Caveat emptor.
 *
 * PUT_PINS allows us to assign the sense of all the pins, including
 * the data pins if being driven by the host. The GET_PINS returns the
 * pins that the peripheral drives, including data if appropriate.
