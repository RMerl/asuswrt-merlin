/*
 * In a GENERIC kernel, we have lots of these vectors floating about,
 * all but one of which we want to go away.  In a non-GENERIC kernel,
 * we want only one, ever.
 *
 * Accomplish this in the GENERIC kernel by puting all of the vectors
 * in the .init.data section where they'll go away.  We'll copy the
 * one we want to the real alpha_mv vector in setup_arch.
 *
 * Accomplish this in a non-GENERIC kernel by ifdef'ing out all but
 * one of the vectors, which will not reside in .init.data.  We then
 * alias this one vector to alpha_mv, so no copy is needed.
 *
 * Upshot: set __initdata to nothing for non-GENERIC kernels.
 *
 * Note we do the same thing for the UNKNOWN kernel, as we need to write
 * to the machine vector while setting it up.
