/* "Fixed" UIC settings (they are chip, not board specific),
 * e.g. polarity/triggerring for internal interrupt sources.
 *
 * Platform port should provide NR_UICS-sized array named ppc4xx_core_uic_cfg
 * with these "fixed" settings: .polarity contains exact value which will
 * be written (masked with "ext_irq_mask") into UICx_PR register,
 * .triggering - to UICx_TR.
 *
 * Settings for external IRQs can be specified separately by the
 * board support code. In this case properly sized array of unsigned
 * char named ppc4xx_uic_ext_irq_cfg should be filled with correct
 * values using IRQ_SENSE_XXXXX and IRQ_POLARITY_XXXXXXX defines.
 *
 * If these arrays aren't provided, UIC initialization code keeps firmware
 * configuration. Also, ppc4xx_uic_ext_irq_cfg implies ppc4xx_core_uic_cfg
 * is defined.
 *
 * Both ppc4xx_core_uic_cfg and ppc4xx_uic_ext_irq_cfg are declared as
 * "weak" symbols in ppc4xx_pic.c
