 * we only use 32,768 of them.  That is ample, since there can be
 * at most around 30,000 tasks in the system anyway, and it means
 * that we can use a bitmap to indicate which contexts are in use.
 * Using a bitmap means that we entirely avoid all of the problems
 * that we used to have when the context number overflowed,
 * particularly on SMP systems.

 * to spread out the entries in the MMU hash table.  Note, if this
 * function is changed then arch/ppc/mm/hashtable.S will have to be

   The MPC8xx has only 16 contexts.  We rotate through them on each
   task switch.  A better way would be to keep track of tasks that
   own contexts, and implement an LRU usage.  That way very active
   tasks don't always have to pay the TLB reload overhead.  The
   kernel pages are mapped shared, so the kernel can run on behalf
   of any task that makes a kernel entry.  Shared does not mean they
   are not protected, just that the ASID comparison is not performed.
        -- Dan

   The IBM4xx has 256 contexts, so we can just rotate through these
   as a way of "switching" contexts.  If the TID of the TLB is zero,
   the PID/TID comparison is disabled, so we can use a TID of zero
   to represent all kernel pages as shared among all contexts.
