 *  byte[1] and LSB in byte[0]. A big endian machine stores MSB in byte[0] 
 *  and LSB in byte[1].
 *
 * This structure is used in the code for things that are endian neutral
 * but that fit in a word so that we can manipulate them efficiently.
 * By endian neutral, I mean things that are really an array of bytes,
 * and always used as such, for example the hint bits. Jean II
