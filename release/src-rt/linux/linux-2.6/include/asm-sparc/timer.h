/* Timer structures. The interrupt timer has two properties which
 * are the counter (which is handled in do_timer in sched.c) and the limit.
 * This limit is where the timer's counter 'wraps' around. Oddly enough,
 * the sun4c timer when it hits the limit wraps back to 1 and not zero
 * thus when calculating the value at which it will fire a microsecond you
 * must adjust by one.  Thanks SUN for designing such great hardware ;(
