/*
 * latency.c: Explicit system-wide latency-expectation infrastructure
 *
 * The purpose of this infrastructure is to allow device drivers to set
 * latency constraint they have and to collect and summarize these
 * expectations globally. The cummulated result can then be used by
 * power management and similar users to make decisions that have
 * tradoffs with a latency component.
 *
 * An example user of this are the x86 C-states; each higher C state saves
 * more power, but has a higher exit latency. For the idle loop power
 * code to make a good decision which C-state to use, information about
 * acceptable latencies is required.
 *
 * An example announcer of latency is an audio driver that knowns it
 * will get an interrupt when the hardware has 200 usec of samples
 * left in the DMA buffer; in that case the driver can set a latency
 * constraint of, say, 150 usec.
 *
 * Multiple drivers can each announce their maximum accepted latency,
 * to keep these appart, a string based identifier is used.
