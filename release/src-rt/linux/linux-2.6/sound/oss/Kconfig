config SOUND_DMAP

	---help---
	  Linux can often have problems allocating DMA buffers for ISA sound
	  cards on machines with more than 16MB of RAM. This is because ISA
	  DMA buffers must exist below the 16MB boundary and it is quite
	  possible that a large enough free block in this region cannot be
	  found after the machine has been running for a while. If you say Y
	  here the DMA buffers (64Kb) will be allocated at boot time and kept
	  until the shutdown. This option is only useful if you said Y to
	  "OSS sound modules", above. If you said M to "OSS sound modules"
	  then you can get the persistent DMA buffer functionality by passing
	  the command-line argument "dmabuf=1" to the sound module.

	  For cards having native support in VoxWare, consult the card
	  specific instructions in <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS>.
	  Some drivers have their own MSS support and saying Y to this option
	  will cause a conflict.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add

config SOUND_MPU401

	  Be careful with this question.  The MPU401 interface is supported by
	  all sound cards.  However, some natively supported cards have their
	  own driver for MPU401.  Enabling this MPU401 option with these cards
	  will cause a conflict.  Also, enabling MPU401 on a system that
	  doesn't really have a MPU401 could cause some trouble.  If your card
	  was in the list of supported cards, look at the card specific
	  instructions in the <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> file.  It
	  is safe to answer Y if you have a true MPU401 MIDI interface card.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "mpu401=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

config SOUND_PAS

	  It is not necessary to add Sound Blaster support separately; it
	  is included in PAS support.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add

	  SM Games). For an unknown card you may answer Y if the card claims
	  to be Sound Blaster-compatible.

	  Please read the file <file:Documentation/sound/oss/Soundblaster>.

	  You should also say Y here for cards based on the Avance Logic

	  for cards based on ESS chips (read
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/ESS1868> and

	  card, say Y here and read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/mwave>.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel and don't want to use
	  isapnp, you have to add "sb=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>" to the kernel

config SOUND_YM3812

	  Answer Y if your card has a FM chip made by Yamaha (OPL2/OPL3/OPL4).
	  Answering Y is usually a safe and recommended choice, however some
	  cards may have software (TSR) FM emulation. Enabling FM support with
	  these cards may cause trouble (I don't currently know of any such
	  cards, however). Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/OPL3> if your card has an OPL3 chip.

	  driver supports Audio Excel DSP 16 but not the III nor PnP versions
	  of this card.

	  The Gallant's Audio Excel DSP 16 card can emulate either an SBPro or

	  or "Microsoft Sound System support", above, and you need to answer
	  the "MSS emulation" and "SBPro emulation" questions below
