/*
  Passthrough can be done in two methods:

  Method 1 : tram
     In original emu10k1, we couldn't bypass the sample rate converters. Even at 48kHz
     (the internal sample rate of the emu10k1) the samples would get messed up.
     To over come this, samples are copied into the tram and a special dsp patch copies
     the samples out and generates interrupts when a block has finnished playing.

  Method 2 : Interpolator bypass

     Creative fixed the sample rate convert problem in emu10k1 rev 7 and higher
     (including the emu10k2 (audigy)). This allows us to use the regular, and much simpler
     playback method. 


  In both methods, dsp code is used to mux audio and passthrough. This ensures that the spdif
  doesn't receive audio and pasthrough data at the same time. The spdif flag SPCS_NOTAUDIODATA
  is set to tell
