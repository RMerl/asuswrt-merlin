/*
 * Semaphores are complex as we wish to avoid using two variables.
 * `count' has multiple roles, depending on its value.  If it is positive
 * or zero, there are no waiters.  The functions here will never be
 * called; see <asm/semaphore.h>
 *
 * When count is -1 it indicates there is at least one task waiting
 * for the semaphore.
 *
 * When count is less than that, there are '- count - 1' wakeups
 * pending.  ie if it has value -3, there are 2 wakeups pending.
 *
 * Note that these functions are only called when there is contention
 * on the lock, and as such all this is the "non-critical" part of the
 * whole semaphore business. The critical part is the inline stuff in
 * <asm/semaphore.h> where we want to avoid any extra jumps and calls.
