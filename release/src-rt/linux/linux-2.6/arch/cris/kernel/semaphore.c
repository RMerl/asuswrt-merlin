/*
 * Semaphores are implemented using a two-way counter:
 * The "count" variable is decremented for each process
 * that tries to sleep, while the "waking" variable is
 * incremented when the "up()" code goes to wake up waiting
 * processes.
 *
 * Notably, the inline "up()" and "down()" functions can
 * efficiently test if they need to do any extra work (up
 * needs to do something only if count was negative before
 * the increment operation.
 *
 * waking_non_zero() (from asm/semaphore.h) must execute
 * atomically.
 *
 * When __up() is called, the count was negative before
 * incrementing it, and we need to wake up somebody.
 *
 * This routine adds one to the count of processes that need to
 * wake up and exit.  ALL waiting processes actually wake up but
 * only the one that gets to the "waking" field first will gate
 * through and acquire the semaphore.  The others will go back
 * to sleep.
 *
 * Note that these functions are only called when there is
 * contention on the lock, and as such all this is the
 * "non-critical" part of the whole semaphore business. The
 * critical part is the inline stuff in <asm/semaphore.h>
 * where we want to avoid any extra jumps and calls.

/*
 * Perform the "down" function.  Return zero for semaphore acquired,
 * return negative for signalled out of the function.
 *
 * If called from __down, the return is ignored and the wait loop is
 * not interruptible.  This means that a task waiting on a semaphore
 * using "down()" cannot be killed until someone does an "up()" on
 * the semaphore.
 *
 * If called from __down_interruptible, the return value gets checked
 * upon return.  If the return value is negative then the task continues
 * with the negative value in the return register (it can be tested by
 * the caller).
 *
 * Either form may be used in conjunction with "up()".
