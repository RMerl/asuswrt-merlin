config RAMSIZE
	hex "Size of RAM (in bytes), or 0 for automatic"

	  Define the size of the system RAM. If you select 0 then the

config VECTORBASE
	hex "Address of the base of system vectors"
	default "0"
	help
	  Define the address of the system vectors. Commonly this is
	  put at the start of RAM, but it doesn't have to be. On ColdFire

	  actually setting the address to use.

config KERNELBASE
	hex "Address of the base of kernel code"
	default "0x400"
	help
	  Typically on m68k systems the kernel will not start at the base
	  of RAM, but usually some small offset from it. Define the start
	  address of the kernel here. The most common setup will have the
	  processor vectors at the base of RAM and then the start of the
	  kernel. On some platforms some RAM is reserved for boot loaders
	  and the kernel starts after that. The 0x400 default was based on
	  a system with the RAM based at address 0, and leaving enough room
