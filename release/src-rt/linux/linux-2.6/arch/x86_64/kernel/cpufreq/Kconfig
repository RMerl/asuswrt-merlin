	  This is deprecated and this functionality is now merged into
	  acpi_cpufreq (X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ). Use that driver instead of
	  speedstep_centrino.
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Enhanced SpeedStep enabled
	  mobile CPUs.  This means Intel Pentium M (Centrino) CPUs
	  or 64bit enabled Intel Xeons.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called speedstep-centrino.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	help
	  This driver adds a CPUFreq driver which utilizes the ACPI
	  Processor Performance States.
	  This driver also supports Intel Enhanced Speedstep.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called acpi-cpufreq.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	help
	  This enables the deprecated /proc/acpi/processor/../performance
	  interface. While it is helpful for debugging, the generic,
	  cross-architecture cpufreq interfaces should be used.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_P4_CLOCKMOD
	tristate "Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation"
	depends on EMBEDDED
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the clock modulation driver for Intel Pentium 4 / XEON
	  processors.  When enabled it will lower CPU temperature by skipping
	  clocks.

	  This driver should be only used in exceptional
	  circumstances when very low power is needed because it causes severe
	  slowdowns and noticeable latencies.  Normally Speedstep should be used
	  instead.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called p4-clockmod.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  Unless you are absolutely sure say N.
