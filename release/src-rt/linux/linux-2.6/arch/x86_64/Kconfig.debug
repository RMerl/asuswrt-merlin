       help
	 Mark the kernel read-only data as write-protected in the pagetables,
	 in order to catch accidental (and incorrect) writes to such const data.
	 This option may have a slight performance impact because a portion
	 of the kernel code won't be covered by a 2MB TLB anymore.
	 If in doubt, say "N".

config IOMMU_DEBUG

       bool "Enable IOMMU debugging"
       help
         Force the IOMMU to on even when you have less than 4GB of
	 memory and add debugging code. On overflow always panic. And
	 allow to enable IOMMU leak tracing. Can be disabled at boot
	 time with iommu=noforce. This will also enable scatter gather
	 list merging.  Currently not recommended for production
	 code. When you use it make sure you have a big enough
	 IOMMU/AGP aperture.  Most of the options enabled by this can
	 be set more finegrained using the iommu= command line
	 options. See Documentation/x86_64/boot-options.txt for more
	 details.

config IOMMU_LEAK

       help
         Add a simple leak tracer to the IOMMU code. This is useful when you
	 are debugging a buggy device driver that leaks IOMMU mappings.

config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
        bool "Check for stack overflows"
        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
        help
	  This option will cause messages to be printed if free stack space
	  drops below a certain limit.

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
        bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
        help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.
