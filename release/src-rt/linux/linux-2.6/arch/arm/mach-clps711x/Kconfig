config ARCH_AUTCPU12
	bool "AUTCPU12"
	help
	  Say Y if you intend to run the kernel on the autronix autcpu12
	  board. This board is based on a Cirrus Logic CS89712.

config ARCH_CDB89712
	bool "CDB89712"
	select ISA
	help
	  This is an evaluation board from Cirrus for the CS89712 processor.
	  The board includes 2 serial ports, Ethernet, IRDA, and expansion
	  headers.  It comes with 16 MB SDRAM and 8 MB flash ROM.

config ARCH_CEIVA
	bool "CEIVA"
	help
	  Say Y here if you intend to run this kernel on the Ceiva/Polaroid
	  PhotoMax Digital Picture Frame.

config ARCH_CLEP7312
	bool "CLEP7312"
	help
	  Boards based on the Cirrus Logic 7212/7312 chips.

config ARCH_EDB7211
	bool "EDB7211"
	select ISA
	select ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE
	select ARCH_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL
	help
	  Say Y here if you intend to run this kernel on a Cirrus Logic EDB-7211
	  evaluation board.

config ARCH_P720T
	bool "P720T"
	help
	  Say Y here if you intend to run this kernel on the ARM Prospector
	  720T.

config ARCH_FORTUNET

# XXX Maybe these should indicate register compatibility
# instead of being mutually exclusive.
config ARCH_EP7211

	depends on ARCH_P720T || ARCH_CEIVA
	default y

config EP72XX_ROM_BOOT
	bool "EP72xx ROM boot"
	depends on ARCH_EP7211 || ARCH_EP7212
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, your CLPS711x-based kernel will use the bootstrap
	  mode memory map instead of the normal memory map.

	  Processors derived from the Cirrus CLPS-711X core support two boot
	  modes.  Normal mode boots from the external memory device at CS0.
	  Bootstrap mode rearranges parts of the memory map, placing an
	  internal 128 byte bootstrap ROM at CS0.  This option performs the
	  address map changes required to support booting in this mode.

	  You almost surely want to say N here.
