config SAMSUNG_PM_DEBUG
	bool "S3C2410 PM Suspend debug"
	depends on PM
	help
	  Say Y here if you want verbose debugging from the PM Suspend and
	  Resume code. See <file:Documentation/arm/Samsung-S3C24XX/Suspend.txt>
	  for more information.

config S3C_PM_DEBUG_LED_SMDK
       bool "SMDK LED suspend/resume debugging"
       depends on PM && (MACH_SMDK6410)
       help
         Say Y here to enable the use of the SMDK LEDs on the baseboard

	depends on PM && CRC32
	help
	  Enable the PM code's memory area checksum over sleep. This option
	  will generate CRCs of all blocks of memory, and store them before
	  going to sleep. The blocks are then checked on resume for any

	  Set the chunksize in Kilobytes of the CRC for checking memory
	  corruption over suspend and resume. A smaller value will mean that
	  the CRC data block will take more memory, but wil identify any
	  faults with better precision.
