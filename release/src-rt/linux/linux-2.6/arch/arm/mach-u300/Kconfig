	---help---
	You need to select the target system, i.e. the
	U300/U330/U335/U365 board that you want to compile your kernel
	for.

config MACH_U300_BS2X
	bool "S26/S26/B25/B26 Test Products"
	depends on MACH_U300
	help
		Select this if you're developing on the
		S26/S25 test products. (Also works on
		B26/B25 big boards.)

config MACH_U300_BS330
	bool "S330/B330 Test Products"
	depends on MACH_U300
	help
		Select this if you're developing on the
		S330/B330 test products.

choice
	prompt "Memory configuration"
	default MACH_U300_SINGLE_RAM
	---help---
	You have to config the kernel according to the physical memory
	configuration.

config MACH_U300_SINGLE_RAM
	bool "Single RAM"
	help
		Select this if you want support for Single RAM phones.

config MACH_U300_DUAL_RAM
	bool "Dual RAM"
	help
		Select this if you want support for Dual RAM phones.
		This is two RAM memories on different EMIFs.

		This creates a small kernel module that creates a dummy
		SPI device to be used for loopback tests. Regularly used
		to test reference designs. If you're not testing SPI,
		you don't need it. Selecting this will activate the
		SPI framework and ARM PL022 support.

		If yes and the Access side CPU has allocated an odd size in
		MiB, this fix gives you one MiB extra that would otherwise be
		lost due to Linux 2 MiB alignment policy.
