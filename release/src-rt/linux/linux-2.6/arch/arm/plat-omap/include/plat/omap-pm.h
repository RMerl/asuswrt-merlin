 * @r: minimum rate in Hz
 *
 * Request that the minimum clock rate on the device @dev's clk @clk
 * be no less than @r Hz.
 *
 * It is expected that the OMAP PM code will use this information to
 * find an OPP or clock setting that will satisfy this clock rate
 * constraint, along with any other applicable system constraints on
 * the clock rate or corresponding voltage, etc.
 *
 * omap_pm_set_min_clk_rate() differs from the clock code's
 * clk_set_rate() in that it considers other constraints before taking
 * any hardware action, and may change a system OPP rather than just a
 * clock rate.  clk_set_rate() is intended to be a low-level
 * interface.
 *
 * omap_pm_set_min_clk_rate() is easily open to abuse.  A better API
 * would be something like "omap_pm_set_min_dev_performance()";
 * however, there is no easily-generalizable concept of performance
 * that applies to all devices.  Only a device (and possibly the
 * device subsystem) has both the subsystem-specific knowledge, and
 * the hardware IP block-specific knowledge, to translate a constraint
 * on "touchscreen sampling accuracy" or "number of pixels or polygons
 * rendered per second" to a clock rate.  This translation can be
 * dependent on the hardware IP block's revision, or firmware version,
 * and the driver is the only code on the system that has this
 * information and can know how to translate that into a clock rate.
 *
 * The intended use-case for this function is for userspace or other
 * kernel code to communicate a particular performance requirement to
 * a subsystem; then for the subsystem to communicate that requirement
 * to something that is meaningful to the device driver; then for the
 * device driver to convert that requirement to a clock rate, and to
 * then call omap_pm_set_min_clk_rate().
 *
 * Users of this function (such as device drivers) should not simply
 * call this function with some high clock rate to ensure "high
 * performance."  Rather, the device driver should take a performance
 * constraint from its subsystem, such as "render at least X polygons
 * per second," and use some formula or table to convert that into a
 * clock rate constraint given the hardware type and hardware
 * revision.  Device drivers or subsystems should not assume that they
 * know how to make a power/performance tradeoff - some device use
 * cases may tolerate a lower-fidelity device function for lower power
 * consumption; others may demand a higher-fidelity device function,
 * no matter what the power consumption.
 *
 * Multiple calls to omap_pm_set_min_clk_rate() will replace the
 * previous rate value for the device @dev.  To remove the minimum clock
 * rate constraint for the device, call with r = 0.
 *
 * Returns -EINVAL for an invalid argument, -ERANGE if the constraint
 * is not satisfiable, or 0 upon success.
