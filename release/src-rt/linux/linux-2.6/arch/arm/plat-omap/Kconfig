config OMAP_SMARTREFLEX
	bool "SmartReflex support"
	depends on (ARCH_OMAP3 || ARCH_OMAP4) && PM
	help
	  Say Y if you want to enable SmartReflex.

	  SmartReflex can perform continuous dynamic voltage
	  scaling around the nominal operating point voltage
	  according to silicon characteristics and operating
	  conditions. Enabling SmartReflex reduces power
	  consumption.

	  Please note, that by default SmartReflex is only
	  initialized. To enable the automatic voltage
	  compensation for vdd mpu  and vdd core from user space,
	  user must write 1 to
		/debug/voltage/vdd_<X>/smartreflex/autocomp,
	  where X is mpu or core for OMAP3.
	  Optionally autocompensation can be enabled in the kernel
	  by default during system init via the enable_on_init flag
	  which an be passed as platform data to the smartreflex driver.

config OMAP_SMARTREFLEX_CLASS3
	bool "Class 3 mode of Smartreflex Implementation"
	depends on OMAP_SMARTREFLEX && TWL4030_CORE
	help
	  Say Y to enable Class 3 implementation of Smartreflex

	  Class 3 implementation of Smartreflex employs continuous hardware
	  voltage calibration.

config OMAP_RESET_CLOCKS
	bool "Reset unused clocks during boot"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	help
	  Say Y if you want to reset unused clocks during boot.
	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are
	  using the clock framework. Broken drivers that do not
	  yet use clock framework may not work with this option.
	  If you are booting from another operating system, you
	  probably do not want this option enabled until your
	  device drivers work properly.

config OMAP_MUX
	bool "OMAP multiplexing support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	default y
	help
	  Pin multiplexing support for OMAP boards. If your bootloader
	  sets the multiplexing correctly, say N. Otherwise, or if unsure,
	  say Y.

config OMAP_MUX_DEBUG
	bool "Multiplexing debug output"
	depends on OMAP_MUX
	help
	  Makes the multiplexing functions print out a lot of debug info.
	  This is useful if you want to find out the correct values of the
	  multiplexing registers.

config OMAP_MUX_WARNINGS
	bool "Warn about pins the bootloader didn't set up"
	depends on OMAP_MUX
	default y
	help
	  Choose Y here to warn whenever driver initialization logic needs
	  to change the pin multiplexing setup.	 When there are no warnings
	  printed, it's safe to deselect OMAP_MUX for your product.

config OMAP_MCBSP
	bool "McBSP support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for the OMAP Multichannel
	  Buffered Serial Port.

config OMAP_MBOX_FWK

	  Say Y here if you want to use OMAP Mailbox framework support for
	  DSP, IVA1.0 and IVA2 in OMAP1/2/3.

config OMAP_MBOX_KFIFO_SIZE
	int "Mailbox kfifo default buffer size (bytes)"
	depends on OMAP_MBOX_FWK

	help
	  Specify the default size of mailbox's kfifo buffers (bytes).
	  This can also be changed at runtime (via the mbox_kfifo_size
	  module parameter).

config OMAP_MPU_TIMER
	bool "Use mpu timer"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP1
	help
	  Select this option if you want to use the OMAP mpu timer. This
	  timer provides more intra-tick resolution than the 32KHz timer,
	  but consumes more power.

config OMAP_32K_TIMER
	bool "Use 32KHz timer"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP16XX || ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	default y if (ARCH_OMAP16XX || ARCH_OMAP2PLUS)
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable the OMAP 32KHz timer.
	  This timer saves power compared to the OMAP_MPU_TIMER, and has
	  support for no tick during idle. The 32KHz timer provides less
	  intra-tick resolution than OMAP_MPU_TIMER. The 32KHz timer is
	  currently only available for OMAP16XX, 24XX, 34XX and OMAP4.

config OMAP3_L2_AUX_SECURE_SAVE_RESTORE
	bool "OMAP3 HS/EMU save and restore for L2 AUX control register"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP3 && PM
	default n
	help
	  Without this option, L2 Auxiliary control register contents are
	  lost during off-mode entry on HS/EMU devices. This feature
	  requires support from PPA / boot-loader in HS/EMU devices, which
	  currently does not exist by default.

	  Select this option if you want to have your system wake up
	  to data on the serial RX line. This allows you to wake the
	  system from serial console.
