   Tight version of mempy for the case of just copying a page.
   Prefetch strategy empirically optimised against RTL simulations
   of SH5-101 cut2 eval chip with Cayman board DDR memory.

   Parameters:
   r2 : source effective address (start of page)
   r3 : destination effective address (start of page)

   Always copies 4096 bytes.

   Points to review.
   * Currently the prefetch is 4 lines ahead and the alloco is 2 lines ahead.
     It seems like the prefetch needs to be at at least 4 lines ahead to get
     the data into the cache in time, and the allocos contend with outstanding
     prefetches for the same cache set, so it's better to have the numbers
     different.
