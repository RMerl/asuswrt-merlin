/* From here onwards, a rewrite of the implementation,
   by Richard.Curnow@superh.com.

   The major changes in this compared to the old version are;
   1. use more selective purging through OCBP instead of using ALLOCO to purge
      by natural replacement.  This avoids purging out unrelated cache lines
      that happen to be in the same set.
   2. exploit the APIs copy_user_page and clear_user_page better
   3. be more selective about I-cache purging, in particular use invalidate_all
      more sparingly.

		special-case code in tlbmiss critical path), or map the page in
		advance (=> flush_tlb_range in advance to avoid multiple hits)
	      - ASID switching
	      - expensive for large ranges

	   2. temporarily map each page in the range to a special effective
	      address and ocbp through the temporary mapping; relies on the
	      fact that SH-5 OCB* always do TLB lookup and match on ptags (they
	      never look at the etags)
	      + no spurious evictions
	      - expensive for large ranges
	      * surely cheaper than (1)

	   3. walk all the lines in the cache, check the tags, if a match
	      occurs create a page mapping to ocbp the line through
	      + no spurious evictions
	      - tag inspection overhead
	      - (especially for small ranges)
	      - potential cost of setting up/tearing down page mapping for
		every line that matches the range
	      * cost partly independent of range size

	   4. walk all the lines in the cache, check the tags, if a match
	      occurs use 4 * alloco to purge the line (+3 other probably
	      innocent victims) by natural eviction
	      + no tlb mapping overheads
	      - spurious evictions
	      - tag inspection overhead

	   5. implement like flush_cache_all
	      + no tag inspection overhead
	      - spurious evictions
	      - bad for small ranges

	   (1) can be ruled out as more expensive than (2).  (2) appears best
	   for small ranges.  The choice between (3), (4) and (5) for large
	   ranges and the range size for the large/small boundary need
	   benchmarking to determine.

	   For now use approach (2) for small ranges and (5) for large ones.
