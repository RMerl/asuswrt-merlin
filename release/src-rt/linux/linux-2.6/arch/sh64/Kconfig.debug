	  This option allows system calls to be traced to the console.  It also
	  aids in detecting kernel stack underflow.  It is useful for debugging
	  early-userland problems (e.g. init incurring fatal exceptions.)

	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger
	  and slower, but it will give very useful debugging information.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able
	  to solve problems without frame pointers.
