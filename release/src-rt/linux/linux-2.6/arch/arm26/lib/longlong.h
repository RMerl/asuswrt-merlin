/* Define auxiliary asm macros.

   1) umul_ppmm(high_prod, low_prod, multipler, multiplicand)
   multiplies two USItype integers MULTIPLER and MULTIPLICAND,
   and generates a two-part USItype product in HIGH_PROD and
   LOW_PROD.

   2) __umulsidi3(a,b) multiplies two USItype integers A and B,
   and returns a UDItype product.  This is just a variant of umul_ppmm.

   3) udiv_qrnnd(quotient, remainder, high_numerator, low_numerator,
   denominator) divides a two-word unsigned integer, composed by the
   integers HIGH_NUMERATOR and LOW_NUMERATOR, by DENOMINATOR and
   places the quotient in QUOTIENT and the remainder in REMAINDER.
   HIGH_NUMERATOR must be less than DENOMINATOR for correct operation.
   If, in addition, the most significant bit of DENOMINATOR must be 1,
   then the pre-processor symbol UDIV_NEEDS_NORMALIZATION is defined to 1.

   4) sdiv_qrnnd(quotient, remainder, high_numerator, low_numerator,
   denominator).  Like udiv_qrnnd but the numbers are signed.  The
   quotient is rounded towards 0.

   5) count_leading_zeros(count, x) counts the number of zero-bits from
   the msb to the first non-zero bit.  This is the number of steps X
   needs to be shifted left to set the msb.  Undefined for X == 0.

   6) add_ssaaaa(high_sum, low_sum, high_addend_1, low_addend_1,
   high_addend_2, low_addend_2) adds two two-word unsigned integers,
   composed by HIGH_ADDEND_1 and LOW_ADDEND_1, and HIGH_ADDEND_2 and
   LOW_ADDEND_2 respectively.  The result is placed in HIGH_SUM and
   LOW_SUM.  Overflow (i.e. carry out) is not stored anywhere, and is
   lost.

   7) sub_ddmmss(high_difference, low_difference, high_minuend,
   low_minuend, high_subtrahend, low_subtrahend) subtracts two
   two-word unsigned integers, composed by HIGH_MINUEND_1 and
   LOW_MINUEND_1, and HIGH_SUBTRAHEND_2 and LOW_SUBTRAHEND_2
   respectively.  The result is placed in HIGH_DIFFERENCE and
   LOW_DIFFERENCE.  Overflow (i.e. carry out) is not stored anywhere,
   and is lost.

   If any of these macros are left undefined for a particular CPU,
   C macros are used.  */
