/* This is the kernel's entry point into the floating point emulator.
It is called from the kernel with code similar to this:

	mov	fp, #0
	teqp	pc, #PSR_I_BIT | MODE_SVC
	ldr	r4, .LC2
	ldr	pc, [r4]		@ Call FP module USR entry point

The kernel expects the emulator to return via one of two possible
points of return it passes to the emulator.  The emulator, if
successful in its emulation, jumps to ret_from_exception and the
kernel takes care of returning control from the trap to the user code.
If the emulator is unable to emulate the instruction, it returns to
fpundefinstr and the kernel halts the user program with a core dump.

This routine does four things:

1) It saves SP into a variable called userRegisters.  The kernel has
created a struct pt_regs on the stack and saved the user registers
into it.  See /usr/include/asm/proc/ptrace.h for details.  The
emulator code uses userRegisters as the base of an array of words from
which the contents of the registers can be extracted.

2) It locates the FP emulator work area within the TSS structure and
points `fpa11' to it.

3) It calls EmulateAll to emulate a floating point instruction.
EmulateAll returns 1 if the emulation was successful, or 0 if not.

4) If an instruction has been emulated successfully, it looks ahead at
the next instruction.  If it is a floating point instruction, it
executes the instruction, without returning to user space.  In this
way it repeatedly looks ahead and executes floating point instructions
until it encounters a non floating point instruction, at which time it
returns via _fpreturn.

This is done to reduce the effect of the trap overhead on each
floating point instructions.  GCC attempts to group floating point
instructions to allow the emulator to spread the cost of the trap over
several floating point instructions.  */
