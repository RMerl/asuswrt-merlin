# RMK wants arm kernels compiled with frame pointers so hardwire this to y.
# If you know what you are doing and are willing to live without stack
# traces, you can get a slightly smaller kernel by setting this option to
# n, but then RMK will have to kill you ;).
config FRAME_POINTER
	bool
	default y
	help
	  If you say N here, the resulting kernel will be slightly smaller and
	  faster. However, when a problem occurs with the kernel, the
	  information that is reported is severely limited. Most people
	  should say Y here.

config DEBUG_USER
	bool "Verbose user fault messages"
	help
	  When a user program crashes due to an exception, the kernel can
	  print a brief message explaining what the problem was. This is
	  sometimes helpful for debugging but serves no purpose on a
	  production system. Most people should say N here.

config DEBUG_WAITQ
	bool "Wait queue debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

config DEBUG_ERRORS
	bool "Verbose kernel error messages"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  This option controls verbose debugging information which can be
	  printed when the kernel detects an internal error. This debugging
	  information is useful to kernel hackers when tracking down problems,
	  but mostly meaningless to other people. It's safe to say Y unless
	  you are concerned with the code size or don't want to see these
	  messages.

# These options are only for real kernel hackers who want to get their hands dirty.
config DEBUG_LL
	bool "Kernel low-level debugging functions"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to include definitions of printascii, printchar, printhex
	  in the kernel.  This is helpful if you are debugging code that
	  executes before the console is initialized.
