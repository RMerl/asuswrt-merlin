config USE_MDIO
	bool "Use MDIO for PHY configuration"
	depends on FEC_ENET
	help
	  On some boards the hardware configuration of the ethernet PHY can be
	  used without any software interaction over the MDIO interface, so
	  all MII code can be omitted. Say N here if unsure or if you don't
	  need link status reports.

	  and decreases the likelihood of dropped packets, but costs memory.

config 8xx_COPYBACK
	bool "Copy-Back Data Cache (else Writethrough)"
	help
	  Saying Y here will cause the cache on an MPC8xx processor to be used
	  in Copy-Back mode.  If you say N here, it is used in Writethrough
	  mode.

	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config 8xx_CPU6
	bool "CPU6 Silicon Errata (860 Pre Rev. C)"
	help
	  MPC860 CPUs, prior to Rev C have some bugs in the silicon, which
	  require workarounds for Linux (and most other OSes to work).  If you
	  get a BUG() very early in boot, this might fix the problem.  For
	  more details read the document entitled "MPC860 Family Device Errata
	  Reference" on Motorola's website.  This option also incurs a
	  performance hit.

	  If in doubt, say N here.
