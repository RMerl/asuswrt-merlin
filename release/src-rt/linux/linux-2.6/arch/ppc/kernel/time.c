/*
 * Common time routines among all ppc machines.
 *
 * Written by Cort Dougan (cort@cs.nmt.edu) to merge
 * Paul Mackerras' version and mine for PReP and Pmac.
 * MPC8xx/MBX changes by Dan Malek (dmalek@jlc.net).
 *
 * First round of bugfixes by Gabriel Paubert (paubert@iram.es)
 * to make clock more stable (2.4.0-test5). The only thing
 * that this code assumes is that the timebases have been synchronized
 * by firmware on SMP and are never stopped (never do sleep
 * on SMP then, nap and doze are OK).
 *
 * TODO (not necessarily in this file):
 * - improve precision and reproducibility of timebase frequency
 * measurement at boot time.
 * - get rid of xtime_lock for gettimeofday (generic kernel problem
 * to be implemented on all architectures for SMP scalability and
 * eventually implementing gettimeofday without entering the kernel).
 * - put all time/clock related variables in a single structure
 * to minimize number of cache lines touched by gettimeofday()
 * - for astronomical applications: add a new function to get
 * non ambiguous timestamps even around leap seconds. This needs
 * a new timestamp format and a good name.
 *
 *
 * The following comment is partially obsolete (at least the long wait
 * is no more a valid reason):
 * Since the MPC8xx has a programmable interrupt timer, I decided to
 * use that rather than the decrementer.  Two reasons: 1.) the clock
 * frequency is low, causing 2.) a long wait in the timer interrupt
 *		while ((d = get_dec()) == dval)
 * loop.  The MPC8xx can be driven from a variety of input clocks,
 * so a number of assumptions have been made here because the kernel
 * parameter HZ is a constant.  We assume (correctly, today :-) that
 * the MPC8xx on the MBX board is driven from a 32.768 kHz crystal.
 * This is then divided by 4, providing a 8192 Hz clock into the PIT.
 * Since it is not possible to get a nice 100 Hz clock out of this, without
 * creating a software PLL, I have set HZ to 128.  -- Dan
 *
 * 1997-09-10  Updated NTP code according to technical memorandum Jan '96
 *             "A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping" by Dave Mills
