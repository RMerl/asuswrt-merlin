config ZORRO

	help
	  This enables support for the Zorro bus in the Amiga. If you have
	  expansion cards in your Amiga that conform to the Amiga
	  AutoConfig(tm) specification, say Y, otherwise N. Note that even
	  expansion cards that do not fit in the Zorro slots but fit in e.g.
	  the CPU slot may fall in this category, so you have to say Y to let
	  Linux use these.

config A2232
	tristate "Commodore A2232 serial support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && APUS
	---help---
	  This option supports the 2232 7-port serial card shipped with the
	  Amiga 2000 and other Zorro-bus machines, dating from 1989.  At
	  a max of 19,200 bps, the ports are served by a 6551 ACIA UART chip
	  each, plus a 8520 CIA, and a master 6502 CPU and buffer as well. The
	  ports were connected with 8 pin DIN connectors on the card bracket,
	  for which 8 pin to DB25 adapters were supplied. The card also had
	  jumpers internally to toggle various pinning configurations.

	  This driver can be built as a module; but then "generic_serial"
	  will also be built as a module. This has to be loaded before
	  "ser_a2232". If you want to do this, answer M here.

	help
	  Use the power-on LED on your machine as a load meter.  The exact
	  behavior is platform-dependent, but normally the flash frequency is
	  a hyperbolic function of the 5-minute load average.
