config MMU
	bool "MMU support"
	help
	  This options switches on and off support for the FR-V MMU
	  (effectively switching between vmlinux and uClinux). Not all FR-V
	  CPUs support this. Currently only the FR451 has a sufficiently
	  featured MMU.

config FRV_OUTOFLINE_ATOMIC_OPS
	bool "Out-of-line the FRV atomic operations"

	help
	  Setting this option causes the FR-V atomic operations to be mostly

	  See Documentation/frv/atomic-ops.txt for more information.

	depends on MMU
	default y
	help
	  If you wish to use more than 256MB of memory with your MMU based
	  system, you will need to select this option. The kernel can only see
	  the memory between 0xC0000000 and 0xD0000000 directly... everything
	  else must be kmapped.

	  The arch is, however, capable of supporting up to 3GB of SDRAM.

config HIGHPTE
	bool "Allocate page tables in highmem"
	depends on HIGHMEM
	default y
	help
	  The VM uses one page of memory for each page table.  For systems
	  with a lot of RAM, this can be wasteful of precious low memory.
	  Setting this option will put user-space page tables in high memory.

	  This option sets the base address for the uClinux kernel. The kernel
	  will rearrange the SDRAM layout to start at this address, and move
	  itself to start there. It must be greater than 0, and it must be
	  sufficiently less than 0xE0000000 that the SDRAM does not intersect
	  the I/O region.

	  The base address must also be aligned such that the SDRAM controller
	  can decode it. For instance, a 512MB SDRAM bank must be 512MB aligned.

	  Selecting this option causes the uClinux kernel to change the

	  prevent userspace accessing the underlying memory directly.

choice
	prompt "CPU Caching mode"
	default FRV_DEFL_CACHE_WBACK
	help
	  This option determines the default caching mode for the kernel.

	  Write-Back caching mode involves the all reads and writes causing
	  the affected cacheline to be read into the cache first before being
	  operated upon. Memory is not then updated by a write until the cache
	  is filled and a cacheline needs to be displaced from the cache to
	  make room. Only at that point is it written back.

	  Write-Behind caching is similar to Write-Back caching, except that a
	  write won't fetch a cacheline into the cache if there isn't already
	  one there; it will write directly to memory instead.

	  Write-Through caching only fetches cachelines from memory on a
	  read. Writes always get written directly to memory. If the affected
	  cacheline is also in cache, it will be updated too.

	  The final option is to turn of caching entirely.

	  Note that not all CPUs support Write-Behind caching. If the CPU on
	  which the kernel is running doesn't, it'll fall back to Write-Back
	  caching.

	help
	  This option controls what data, if any, should be placed in the GP
	  relative data sections. Using this means that the compiler can
	  generate accesses to the data using GR16-relative addressing which
	  is faster than absolute instructions and saves space (2 instructions
	  per access).

	  However, the GPREL region is limited in size because the immediate
	  value used in the load and store instructions is limited to a 12-bit
	  signed number.

	  So if the linker starts complaining that accesses to GPREL data are
	  out of range, try changing this option from the default.

	  Note that modules will always be compiled with this feature disabled
	  as the module data will not be in range of the GP base address.

config RESERVE_DMA_COHERENT

	  Many PCI drivers require access to uncached memory for DMA device

	  a fully featured MMU is available, this can be done through page
	  table settings, but if not, a region has to be set aside and marked
	  with a special DAMPR register.

	  Setting this option causes uClinux to set aside a portion of the
	  available memory for use in this manner. The memory will then be
	  unavailable for normal kernel use.
