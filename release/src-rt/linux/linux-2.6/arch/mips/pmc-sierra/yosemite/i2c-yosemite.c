/*
 * Detailed Description:
 *
 * This block implements the I2C interface to the slave devices like the
 * Atmel 24C32 EEPROM and the MAX 1619 Sensors device. The I2C Master interface
 * can be controlled by the SCMB block. And the SCMB block kicks in only when
 * using the Ethernet Mode of operation and __not__ the SysAD mode
 *
 * The SCMB controls the two modes: MDIO and the I2C. The MDIO mode is used to
 * communicate with the Quad-PHY from Marvel. The I2C is used to communicate
 * with the I2C slave devices.  It seems that the driver does not explicitly
 * deal with the control of SDA and SCL serial lines. So, the driver will set
 * the slave address, drive the command and then the data.  The SCMB will then
 * control the two serial lines as required.
 *
 * It seems the documents are very unclear abt this. Hence, I took some time
 * out to write the desciption to have an idea of how the I2C can actually
 * work. Currently, this Linux driver wont be integrated into the generic Linux
 * I2C framework. And finally, the I2C interface is also known as the 2BI
 * interface. 2BI means 2-bit interface referring to SDA and SCL serial lines
 * respectively.
