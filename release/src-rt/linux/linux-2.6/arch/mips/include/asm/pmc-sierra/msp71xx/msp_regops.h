/*
 * SMP/VPE-safe functions to access "registers" (see note).
 *
 * NOTES:
* - These macros use ll/sc instructions, so it is your responsibility to
 * ensure these are available on your platform before including this file.
 * - The MIPS32 spec states that ll/sc results are undefined for uncached
 * accesses. This means they can't be used on HW registers accessed
 * through kseg1. Code which requires these macros for this purpose must
 * front-end the registers with cached memory "registers" and have a single
 * thread update the actual HW registers.
 * - A maximum of 2k of code can be inserted between ll and sc. Every
 * memory accesses between the instructions will increase the chance of
 * sc failing and having to loop.
 * - When using custom_read_reg32/custom_write_reg32 only perform the
 * necessary logical operations on the register value in between these
 * two calls. All other logic should be performed before the first call.
  * - There is a bug on the R10000 chips which has a workaround. If you
 * are affected by this bug, make sure to define the symbol 'R10000_LLSC_WAR'
 * to be non-zero.  If you are using this header from within linux, you may
 * include <asm/war.h> before including this file to have this defined
 * appropriately for you.
