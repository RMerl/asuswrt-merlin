config CAVIUM_CN63XXP1
	bool "Enable CN63XXP1 errata worarounds"
	default "n"
	help
	  The CN63XXP1 chip requires build time workarounds to
	  function reliably, select this option to enable them.  These
	  workarounds will cause a slight decrease in performance on
	  non-CN63XXP1 hardware, so it is recommended to select "n"
	  unless it is known the workarounds are needed.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_2ND_KERNEL
	bool "Build the kernel to be used as a 2nd kernel on the same chip"
	default "n"
	help
	  This option configures this kernel to be linked at a different
	  address and use the 2nd uart for output. This allows a kernel built
	  with this option to be run at the same time as one built without this
	  option.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_HW_FIX_UNALIGNED
	bool "Enable hardware fixups of unaligned loads and stores"
	default "y"
	help
	  Configure the Octeon hardware to automatically fix unaligned loads
	  and stores. Normally unaligned accesses are fixed using a kernel
	  exception handler. This option enables the hardware automatic fixups,
	  which requires only an extra 3 cycles. Disable this option if you
	  are running code that relies on address exceptions on unaligned
	  accesses.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_CVMSEG_SIZE
	int "Number of L1 cache lines reserved for CVMSEG memory"
	range 0 54
	default 1
	help
	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache as a
	  local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the cache is.
	  This selects the size of CVMSEG LM, which is in cache blocks. The
	  legally range is from zero to 54 cache blocks (i.e. CVMSEG LM is
	  between zero and 6192 bytes).

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2
	bool "Lock often used kernel code in the L2"
	default "y"
	help
	  Enable locking parts of the kernel into the L2 cache.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2_TLB
	bool "Lock the TLB handler in L2"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2
	default "y"
	help
	  Lock the low level TLB fast path into L2.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2_EXCEPTION
	bool "Lock the exception handler in L2"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2
	default "y"
	help
	  Lock the low level exception handler into L2.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2_LOW_LEVEL_INTERRUPT
	bool "Lock the interrupt handler in L2"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2
	default "y"
	help
	  Lock the low level interrupt handler into L2.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2_INTERRUPT
	bool "Lock the 2nd level interrupt handler in L2"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2
	default "y"
	help
	  Lock the 2nd level interrupt handler in L2.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2_MEMCPY
	bool "Lock memcpy() in L2"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_LOCK_L2
	default "y"
	help
	  Lock the kernel's implementation of memcpy() into L2.
