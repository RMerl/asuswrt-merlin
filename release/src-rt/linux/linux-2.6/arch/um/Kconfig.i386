	help
        This is needed when the host kernel on which you run has a non-default
	(like 2G/2G) memory split, instead of the customary 3G/1G. If you did
	not recompile your own kernel but use the default distro's one, you can
	safely accept the "Default split" option.

	It can be enabled on recent (>=2.6.16-rc2) vanilla kernels via
	CONFIG_VM_SPLIT_*, or on previous kernels with special patches (-ck
	patchset by Con Kolivas, or other ones) - option names match closely the
	host CONFIG_VM_SPLIT_* ones.

	A lower setting (where 1G/3G is lowest and 3G/1G is higher) will
	tolerate even more "normal" host kernels, but an higher setting will be
	stricter.

	So, if you do not know what to do here, say 'Default split'.

	Three-level pagetables will let UML have more than 4G of physical
	memory.  All the memory that can't be mapped directly will be treated
	as high memory.

	However, this it experimental on 32-bit architectures, so if unsure say
	N (on x86-64 it's automatically enabled, instead, as it's safe there).
