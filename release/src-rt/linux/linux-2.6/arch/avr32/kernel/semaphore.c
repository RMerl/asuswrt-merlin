/*
 * Semaphores are implemented using a two-way counter:
 * The "count" variable is decremented for each process
 * that tries to acquire the semaphore, while the "sleeping"
 * variable is a count of such acquires.
 *
 * Notably, the inline "up()" and "down()" functions can
 * efficiently test if they need to do any extra work (up
 * needs to do something only if count was negative before
 * the increment operation.
 *
 * "sleeping" and the contention routine ordering is protected
 * by the spinlock in the semaphore's waitqueue head.
 *
 * Note that these functions are only called when there is
 * contention on the lock, and as such all this is the
 * "non-critical" part of the whole semaphore business. The
 * critical part is the inline stuff in <asm/semaphore.h>
 * where we want to avoid any extra jumps and calls.

/*
 * Logic:
 *  - only on a boundary condition do we need to care. When we go
 *    from a negative count to a non-negative, we wake people up.
 *  - when we go from a non-negative count to a negative do we
 *    (a) synchronize with the "sleeper" count and (b) make sure
 *    that we're on the wakeup list before we synchronize so that
 *    we cannot lose wakeup events.
