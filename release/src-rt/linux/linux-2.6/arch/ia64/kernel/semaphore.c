/*
 * Semaphores are implemented using a two-way counter: The "count"
 * variable is decremented for each process that tries to acquire the
 * semaphore, while the "sleepers" variable is a count of such
 * acquires.
 *
 * Notably, the inline "up()" and "down()" functions can efficiently
 * test if they need to do any extra work (up needs to do something
 * only if count was negative before the increment operation.
 *
 * "sleeping" and the contention routine ordering is protected
 * by the spinlock in the semaphore's waitqueue head.
 *
 * Note that these functions are only called when there is contention
 * on the lock, and as such all this is the "non-critical" part of the
 * whole semaphore business. The critical part is the inline stuff in
 * <asm/semaphore.h> where we want to avoid any extra jumps and calls.

 * Logic:
 *  - Only on a boundary condition do we need to care. When we go

 *  - When we go from a non-negative count to a negative do we
 *    (a) synchronize with the "sleepers" count and (b) make sure
 *    that we're on the wakeup list before we synchronize so that
 *    we cannot lose wakeup events.
