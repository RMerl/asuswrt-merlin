	  SHA256 secure hash standard (DFIPS 180-2).

	  This version of SHA implements a 256 bit hash with 128 bits of
	  security against collision attacks.

	  This is the s390 hardware accelerated implementation of the
	  AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197). AES uses the Rijndael
	  algorithm.

	  Rijndael appears to be consistently a very good performer in
	  both hardware and software across a wide range of computing
	  environments regardless of its use in feedback or non-feedback
	  modes. Its key setup time is excellent, and its key agility is
	  good. Rijndael's very low memory requirements make it very well
	  suited for restricted-space environments, in which it also
	  demonstrates excellent performance. Rijndael's operations are
	  among the easiest to defend against power and timing attacks.

	  On s390 the System z9-109 currently only supports the key size
	  of 128 bit.

	  Select this option if you want to use the s390 pseudo random number
	  generator. The PRNG is part of the cryptographic processor functions
	  and uses triple-DES to generate secure random numbers like the
	  ANSI X9.17 standard. The PRNG is usable via the char device
	  /dev/prandom.
