	def_bool y
	prompt "Filter access to /dev/mem"
	---help---
	  This option restricts access to /dev/mem.  If this option is
	  disabled, you allow userspace access to all memory, including
	  kernel and userspace memory. Accidental memory access is likely
	  to be disastrous.
	  Memory access is required for experts who want to debug the kernel.

	  If you are unsure, say Y.

config DEBUG_STRICT_USER_COPY_CHECKS
	def_bool n
	prompt "Strict user copy size checks"
	---help---
	  Enabling this option turns a certain set of sanity checks for user
	  copy operations into compile time warnings.

	  The copy_from_user() etc checks are there to help test if there
	  are sufficient security checks on the length argument of
	  the copy operation, by having gcc prove that the argument is
	  within bounds.

	  If unsure, or if you run an older (pre 4.4) gcc, say N.
