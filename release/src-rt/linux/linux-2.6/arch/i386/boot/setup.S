 *
 * setup.s is responsible for getting the system data from the BIOS,
 * and putting them into the appropriate places in system memory.
 * both setup.s and system has been loaded by the bootblock.
 *
 * This code asks the bios for memory/disk/other parameters, and
 * puts them in a "safe" place: 0x90000-0x901FF, ie where the
 * boot-block used to be. It is then up to the protected mode
 * system to read them from there before the area is overwritten
 * for buffer-blocks.
 *
 * Move PS/2 aux init code to psaux.c
 * (troyer@saifr00.cfsat.Honeywell.COM) 03Oct92
 *
 * some changes and additional features by Christoph Niemann,
 * March 1993/June 1994 (Christoph.Niemann@linux.org)
 *
 * add APM BIOS checking by Stephen Rothwell, May 1994
 * (sfr@canb.auug.org.au)
 *
 * High load stuff, initrd support and position independency
 * by Hans Lermen & Werner Almesberger, February 1996
 * <lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de>, <almesber@lrc.epfl.ch>
 *
 * Video handling moved to video.S by Martin Mares, March 1996
 * <mj@k332.feld.cvut.cz>
 *
 * Extended memory detection scheme retwiddled by orc@pell.chi.il.us (david
 * parsons) to avoid loadlin confusion, July 1997
 *
 * Transcribed from Intel (as86) -> AT&T (gas) by Chris Noe, May 1999.
 * <stiker@northlink.com>
 *
 * Fix to work around buggy BIOSes which don't use carry bit correctly
 * and/or report extended memory in CX/DX for e801h memory size detection 
 * call.  As a result the kernel got wrong figures.  The int15/e801h docs
 * from Ralf Brown interrupt list seem to indicate AX/BX should be used
 * anyway.  So to avoid breaking many machines (presumably there was a reason
 * to orginally use CX/DX instead of AX/BX), we do a kludge to see
 * if CX/DX have been changed in the e801 call and if so use AX/BX .
 * Michael Miller, April 2001 <michaelm@mjmm.org>
