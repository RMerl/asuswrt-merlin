	   5V slots get into the CPU via a different path from the IRQ lines
	   from the 3 3.3V slots.  Thus, we have to detect whether the card's
	   interrupts go via the 5V or 3.3V path, i.e. the 'bridge swizzling'
	   at the point where we cross from 5V to 3.3V is not the normal case.

	   The added complication is that we don't know that the 5V slots are
	   always bus 2, because a card containing a PCI-PCI bridge may be
	   plugged into a 3.3V slot, and this changes the bus numbering.

	   Also, the Cayman has an intermediate PCI bus that goes a custom
	   expansion board header (and to the secondary bridge).  This bus has
	   never been used in practice.

	   The 1ary onboard PCI-PCI bridge is device 3 on bus 0
	   The 2ary onboard PCI-PCI bridge is device 0 on the 2ary bus of
	   the 1ary bridge.
