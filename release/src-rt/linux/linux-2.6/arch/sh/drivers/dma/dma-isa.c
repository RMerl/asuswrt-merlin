/*
 * This implements a small wrapper set to make code using the old ISA DMA API
 * work with the SH DMA API. Since most of the work in the new API happens
 * at ops->xfer() time, we simply use the various set_dma_xxx() routines to
 * fill in per-channel info, and then hand hand this off to ops->xfer() at
 * enable_dma() time.
 *
 * For channels that are doing on-demand data transfer via cascading, the
 * channel itself will still need to be configured through the new API. As
 * such, this code is meant for only the simplest of tasks (and shouldn't be
 * used in any new drivers at all).
 *
 * NOTE: ops->xfer() is the preferred way of doing things. However, there
 * are some users of the ISA DMA API that exist in common code that we
 * don't necessarily want to go out of our way to break, so we still
 * allow for some compatibility at that level. Any new code is strongly
 * advised to run far away from the ISA DMA API and use the SH DMA API
 * directly.
