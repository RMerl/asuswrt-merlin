/*
 * The SRM console *disables* the IDE interface, this code ensures it's
 * enabled.
 *
 * This code bangs on a control register of the 87312 Super I/O chip
 * that implements parallel port/serial ports/IDE/FDI.  Depending on
 * the motherboard, the Super I/O chip can be configured through a
 * pair of registers that are located either at I/O ports 0x26e/0x26f
 * or 0x398/0x399.  Unfortunately, autodetecting which base address is
 * in use works only once (right after a reset).  The Super I/O chip
 * has the additional quirk that configuration register data must be
 * written twice (I believe this is a safety feature to prevent
 * accidental modification---fun, isn't it?).
