Introduction:

	The hw_random device driver is software that makes use of a
	special hardware feature on your CPU or motherboard,
	a Random Number Generator (RNG).

	In order to make effective use of this device driver, you
	should download the support software as well.  Download the
	latest version of the "rng-tools" package from the
	hw_random driver's official Web site:

		http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/

About the Intel RNG hardware, from the firmware hub datasheet:

	The Firmware Hub integrates a Random Number Generator (RNG)
	using thermal noise generated from inherently random quantum
	mechanical properties of silicon. When not generating new random
	bits the RNG circuitry will enter a low power state. Intel will
	provide a binary software driver to give third party software
	access to our RNG for use as a security feature. At this time,
	the RNG is only to be used with a system in an OS-present state.

Theory of operation:

	Character driver.  Using the standard open()
	and read() system calls, you can read random data from
	the hardware RNG device.  This data is NOT CHECKED by any
	fitness tests, and could potentially be bogus (if the
	hardware is faulty or has been tampered with).  Data is only
	output if the hardware "has-data" flag is set, but nevertheless
	a security-conscious person would run fitness tests on the
	data before assuming it is truly random.

	/dev/hwrandom is char device major 10, minor 183.

Driver notes:

	* FIXME: support poll(2)

	NOTE: request_mem_region was removed, for two reasons:
	1) Only one RNG is supported by this driver, 2) The location
	used by the RNG is a fixed location in MMIO-addressable memory,
	3) users with properly working BIOS e820 handling will always
	have the region in which the RNG is located reserved, so
	request_mem_region calls always fail for proper setups.
	However, for people who use mem=XX, BIOS e820 information is
	-not- in /proc/iomem, and request_mem_region(RNG_ADDR) can
	succeed.
