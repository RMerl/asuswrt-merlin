Module Parameters
-----------------

* force_addr: int
  Initialize the ISA address of the sensors
* force_i2c: int
  Initialize the I2C address of the sensors
* init: int
  (default is 1)
  Use 'init=0' to bypass initializing the chip.
  Try this if your computer crashes when you load the module.
* reset: int
  (default is 0)
  The driver used to reset the chip on load, but does no more. Use
  'reset=1' to restore the old behavior. Report if you need to do this.

Description
-----------

This driver implements support for ISA accesses *only* for
the Winbond W83627HF, W83627THF, W83697HF and W83637HF Super I/O chips.
We will refer to them collectively as Winbond chips.

This driver supports ISA accesses, which should be more reliable
than i2c accesses. Also, for Tyan boards which contain both a
Super I/O chip and a second i2c-only Winbond chip (often a W83782D),
using this driver will avoid i2c address conflicts and complex
initialization that were required in the w83781d driver.

If you really want i2c accesses for these Super I/O chips,
use the w83781d driver. However this is not the preferred method
now that this ISA driver has been developed.

The w83627_HF_ uses pins 110-106 as VID0-VID4. The w83627_THF_ uses the
same pins as GPIO[0:4]. Technically, the w83627_THF_ does not support a
VID reading. However the two chips have the identical 128 pin package. So,
it is possible or even likely for a w83627thf to have the VID signals routed
to these pins despite their not being labeled for that purpose. Therefore,
the w83627thf driver interprets these as VID. If the VID on your board
doesn't work, first see doc/vid in the lm_sensors package[1]. If that still
doesn't help, you may just ignore the bogus VID reading with no harm done.

For further information on this driver see the w83781d driver documentation.
