This document describes how to upload the cx2341x firmware to the card.

How to find
===========

See the web pages of the various projects that uses this chip for information
on how to obtain the firmware.

The firmware stored in a Windows driver can be detected as follows:

- Each firmware image is 256k bytes.
- The 1st 32-bit word of the Encoder image is 0x0000da7
- The 1st 32-bit word of the Decoder image is 0x00003a7
- The 2nd 32-bit word of both images is 0xaa55bb66

How to load
===========

- Issue the FWapi command to stop the encoder if it is running. Wait for the
  command to complete.
- Issue the FWapi command to stop the decoder if it is running. Wait for the
  command to complete.
- Issue the I2C command to the digitizer to stop emitting VSYNC events.
- Issue the FWapi command to halt the encoder's firmware.
- Sleep for 10ms.
- Issue the FWapi command to halt the decoder's firmware.
- Sleep for 10ms.
- Write 0x00000000 to register 0x2800 to stop the Video Display Module.
- Write 0x00000005 to register 0x2D00 to stop the AO (audio output?).
- Write 0x00000000 to register 0xA064 to ping? the APU.
- Write 0xFFFFFFFE to register 0x9058 to stop the VPU.
- Write 0xFFFFFFFF to register 0x9054 to reset the HW blocks.
- Write 0x00000001 to register 0x9050 to stop the SPU.
- Sleep for 10ms.
- Write 0x0000001A to register 0x07FC to init the Encoder SDRAM's pre-charge.
- Write 0x80000640 to register 0x07F8 to init the Encoder SDRAM's refresh to 1us.
- Write 0x0000001A to register 0x08FC to init the Decoder SDRAM's pre-charge.
- Write 0x80000640 to register 0x08F8 to init the Decoder SDRAM's refresh to 1us.
- Sleep for 512ms. (600ms is recommended)
- Transfer the encoder's firmware image to offset 0 in Encoder memory space.
- Transfer the decoder's firmware image to offset 0 in Decoder memory space.
- Use a read-modify-write operation to Clear bit 0 of register 0x9050 to
  re-enable the SPU.
- Sleep for 1 second.
- Use a read-modify-write operation to Clear bits 3 and 0 of register 0x9058
  to re-enable the VPU.
- Sleep for 1 second.
- Issue status API commands to both firmware images to verify.
