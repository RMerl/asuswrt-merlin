Linux driver for STV0680 based USB cameras

Copyright, 2001, Kevin Sisson


INTRODUCTION:

STMicroelectronics produces the STV0680B chip, which comes in two
types, -001 and -003. The -003 version allows the recording and downloading
of sound clips from the camera, and allows a flash attachment. Otherwise,
it uses the same commands as the -001 version. Both versions support a
variety of SDRAM sizes and sensors, allowing for a maximum of 26 VGA or 20
CIF pictures. The STV0680 supports either a serial or a usb interface, and
video is possible through the usb interface.

The following cameras are known to work with this driver, although any
camera with Vendor/Product codes of 0553/0202 should work:

Aiptek Pencam (various models)
Nisis QuickPix 2
Radio Shack 'Kid's digital camera' (#60-1207)
At least one Trust Spycam model
Several other European brand models

WHAT YOU NEED:

-	USB support
-	VIDEO4LINUX support

MODULE OPTIONS:

When the driver is compiled as a module, you can set a "swapRGB=1"
option, if necessary, for those applications that require it
(such as xawtv). However, the driver should detect and set this
automatically, so this option should not normally be used.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:

The driver seems to work better with the usb-ohci than the usb-uhci host
controller driver.
