		Auerswald USB kernel driver
		===========================

What is it? What can I do with it?
==================================
The auerswald USB kernel driver connects your linux 2.4.x
system to the auerswald usb-enabled devices.

There are two types of auerswald usb devices:
a) small PBX systems (ISDN)
b) COMfort system telephones (ISDN)

The driver installation creates the devices
/dev/usb/auer0..15. These devices carry a vendor-
specific protocol. You may run all auerswald java
software on it. The java software needs a native
library "libAuerUsbJNINative.so" installed on
your system. This library is available from
auerswald and shipped as part of the java software.

You may create the devices with:
	mknod -m 666 /dev/usb/auer0 c 180 112
	...
	mknod -m 666 /dev/usb/auer15 c 180 127

Future plans
