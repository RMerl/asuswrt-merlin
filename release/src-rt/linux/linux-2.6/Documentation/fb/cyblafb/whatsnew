      - the vesafb parameter has been removed as I decided to allow the
      	feature without any special parameter.

      - Cyblafb does not use the vga style of panning any longer, now the
      	"right view" register in the graphics engine IO space is used. Without
	that change it was impossible to use all available memory, and without
	access to all available memory it is impossible to ywrap.

      - The imageblit function now uses hardware acceleration for all font
        widths. Hardware blitting across pixel column 2048 is broken in the
	cyberblade/i1 graphics core, but we work around that hardware bug.

      - modes with vxres != xres are supported now.

      - ywrap scrolling is supported now and the default. This is a big
        performance gain.

      - default video modes use vyres > yres and vxres > xres to allow
        almost optimal scrolling speed for normal and rotated screens

      - some features mainly usefull for debugging the upper layers of the
        framebuffer system have been added, have a look at the code

      - fixed: Oops after unloading cyblafb when reading /proc/io*

      - we work around some bugs of the higher framebuffer layers.
