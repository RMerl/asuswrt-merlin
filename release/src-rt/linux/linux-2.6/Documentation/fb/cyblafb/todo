TODO / Missing features
=======================

Verify LCD stuff		"stretch" and "center" options are
				completely untested ... this code needs to be
				verified. As I don't have access to such
				hardware, please contact me if you are
				willing run some tests.

Interlaced video modes		The reason that interleaved
				modes are disabled is that I do not know
				the meaning of the vertical interlace
				parameter. Also the datasheet mentions a
				bit d8 of a horizontal interlace parameter,
				but nowhere the lower 8 bits. Please help
				if you can.

low-res double scan modes	Who needs it?

accelerated color blitting	Who needs it? The console driver does use color
				blitting for nothing but drawing the penguine,
				everything else is done using color expanding
				blitting of 1bpp character bitmaps.

ioctls				Who needs it?

TV-out				Will be done later. Use "vga= " at boot time
				to set a suitable video mode.

???				Feel free to contact me if you have any
				feature requests
