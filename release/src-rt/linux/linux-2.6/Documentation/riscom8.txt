Misc. notes for RISCom/8 serial driver, in no particular order :)

1) This driver can support up to 4 boards at time.
   Use string "riscom8=0xXXX,0xXXX,0xXXX,0xXXX" at LILO prompt, for
   setting I/O base addresses for boards. If you compile driver
   as module use modprobe options "iobase=0xXXX iobase1=0xXXX iobase2=..."

2) The driver partially supports famous 'setserial' program, you can use almost
   any of its options, excluding port & irq settings.

3) There are some misc. defines at the beginning of riscom8.c, please read the 
   comments and try to change some of them in case of problems.

4) I consider the current state of the driver as BETA.

5) SDL Communications WWW page is http://www.sdlcomm.com.

6) You can use the MAKEDEV program to create RISCom/8 /dev/ttyL* entries.

7) Minor numbers for first board are 0-7, for second 8-15, etc.
