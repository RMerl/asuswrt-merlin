Kernel driver i2c-parport-light

Author: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org> 

This driver is a light version of i2c-parport. It doesn't depend        
on the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead. This might be
prefered on embedded systems where wasting memory for the clean but heavy
parport handling is not an option. The drawback is a reduced portability
and the impossibility to daisy-chain other parallel port devices.                 
  
Please see i2c-parport for documentation.
