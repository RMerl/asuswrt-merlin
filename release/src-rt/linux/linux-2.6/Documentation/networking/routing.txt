The directory ftp.inr.ac.ru:/ip-routing contains:

- iproute.c - "professional" routing table maintenance utility.

- rdisc.tar.gz - rdisc daemon, ported from Sun.
	STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL HOSTS.

- routing.tgz - original Mike McLagan's route by source patch.
		Currently it is obsolete.

- gated.dif-ss<NEWEST>.gz - gated-R3_6Alpha_2 fixes.
	        Look at README.gated

- mrouted-3.8.dif.gz - mrouted-3.8 fixes.

- rtmon.c - trivial debugging utility: reads and stores netlink.


NEWS for user.

- Policy based routing. Routing decisions are made on the basis
  not only of destination address, but also source address,
  TOS and incoming interface.
- Complete set of IP level control messages.
  Now Linux is the only OS in the world complying to RFC requirements.
  Great win 8)
- New interface addressing paradigm.
  Assignment of address ranges to interface,
  multiple prefixes etc. etc.
  Do not bother, it is compatible with the old one. Moreover:
- You don't need to do "route add aaa.bbb.ccc... eth0" anymore,
  it is done automatically.
- "Abstract" UNIX sockets and security enhancements.
  This is necessary to use TIRPC and TLI emulation library.

NEWS for hacker.

- New destination cache. Flexible, robust and just beautiful.
- Network stack is reordered, simplified, optimized, a lot of bugs fixed.
  (well, and new bugs were introduced, but I haven't seen them yet 8))
  It is difficult to describe all the changes, look into source.

If you see this file, then this patch works 8)
