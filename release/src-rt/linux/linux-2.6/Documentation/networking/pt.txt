This is the README for the Gracilis Packetwin device driver, version 0.5
ALPHA for Linux 1.3.43.

These files will allow you to talk to the PackeTwin (now know as PT) and
connect through it just like a pair of TNCs.  To do this you will also
require the AX.25 code in the kernel enabled.

There are four files in this archive; this readme, a patch file, a .c file
and finally a .h file.  The two program files need to be put into the
drivers/net directory in the Linux source tree, for me this is the
directory /usr/src/linux/drivers/net.  The patch file needs to be patched in
at the top of the Linux source tree (/usr/src/linux in my case).

You will most probably have to edit the pt.c file to suit your own setup,
this should just involve changing some of the defines at the top of the file. 
Please note that if you run an external modem you must specify a speed of 0.

The program is currently setup to run a 4800 baud external modem on port A
and a Kantronics DE-9600 daughter board on port B so if you have this (or
something similar) then you're right.

To compile in the driver, put the files in the correct place and patch in
the diff.  You will have to re-configure the kernel again before you
recompile it. 

The driver is not real good at the moment for finding the card.  You can
'help' it by changing the order of the potential addresses in the structure
found in the pt_init() function so the address of where the card is is put
first.

After compiling, you have to get them going, they are pretty well like any
other net device and just need ifconfig to get them going.
As an example, here is my /etc/rc.net
--------------------------

#
# Configure the PackeTwin, port A.
/sbin/ifconfig pt0a 44.136.8.87 hw ax25 vk2xlz mtu 512 
/sbin/ifconfig pt0a 44.136.8.87 broadcast 44.136.8.255 netmask 255.255.255.0
/sbin/route add -net 44.136.8.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev pt0a
/sbin/route add -net 44.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 gw 44.136.8.68 dev pt0a
/sbin/route add -net 138.25.16.0 netmask 255.255.240.0 dev pt0a
/sbin/route add -host 44.136.8.255 dev pt0a
#
# Configure the PackeTwin, port B.
/sbin/ifconfig pt0b 44.136.8.87 hw ax25 vk2xlz-1 mtu 512
/sbin/ifconfig pt0b 44.136.8.87 broadcast 44.255.255.255 netmask 255.0.0.0
/sbin/route add -host 44.136.8.216 dev pt0b
/sbin/route add -host 44.136.8.95  dev pt0b
/sbin/route add -host 44.255.255.255 dev pt0b

This version of the driver comes under the GNU GPL.  If you have one of my
previous (non-GPL) versions of the driver, please update to this one.

I hope that this all works well for you.  I would be pleased to hear how
many people use the driver and if it does its job.
