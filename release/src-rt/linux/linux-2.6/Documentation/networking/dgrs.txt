    The Digi International RightSwitch SE-X (dgrs) Device Driver

This is a Linux driver for the Digi International RightSwitch SE-X
EISA and PCI boards.  These are 4 (EISA) or 6 (PCI) port Ethernet
switches and a NIC combined into a single board.  This driver can
be compiled into the kernel statically or as a loadable module.

There is also a companion management tool, called "xrightswitch".
The management tool lets you watch the performance graphically,
as well as set the SNMP agent IP and IPX addresses, IEEE Spanning
Tree, and Aging time.  These can also be set from the command line
when the driver is loaded.  The driver command line options are:

	debug=NNN		Debug printing level
	dma=0/1			Disable/Enable DMA on PCI card
	spantree=0/1		Disable/Enable IEEE spanning tree
	hashexpire=NNN		Change address aging time (default 300 seconds)
	ipaddr=A,B,C,D		Set SNMP agent IP address i.e. 199,86,8,221
	iptrap=A,B,C,D		Set SNMP agent IP trap address i.e. 199,86,8,221
	ipxnet=NNN		Set SNMP agent IPX network number
	nicmode=0/1		Disable/Enable multiple NIC mode

There is also a tool for setting up input and output packet filters
on each port, called "dgrsfilt".

Both the management tool and the filtering tool are available
separately from the following FTP site:

	ftp://ftp.dgii.com/drivers/rightswitch/linux/

When nicmode=1, the board and driver operate as 4 or 6 individual
NIC ports (eth0...eth5) instead of as a switch.  All switching
functions are disabled.  In the future, the board firmware may include
a routing cache when in this mode.
