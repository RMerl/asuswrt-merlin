To use the IrDA protocols within Linux you will need to get a suitable copy
of the IrDA Utilities. More detailed information about these and associated
programs can be found on http://irda.sourceforge.net/

For more information about how to use the IrDA protocol stack, see the
Linux Infrared HOWTO by Werner Heuser <wehe@tuxmobil.org>:
<http://www.tuxmobil.org/Infrared-HOWTO/Infrared-HOWTO.html>

There is an active mailing list for discussing Linux-IrDA matters called
    irda-users@lists.sourceforge.net
