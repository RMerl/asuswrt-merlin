IP OVER INFINIBAND

  The ib_ipoib driver is an implementation of the IP over InfiniBand
  protocol as specified by RFC 4391 and 4392, issued by the IETF ipoib
  working group.  It is a "native" implementation in the sense of
  setting the interface type to ARPHRD_INFINIBAND and the hardware
  address length to 20 (earlier proprietary implementations
  masqueraded to the kernel as ethernet interfaces).

Partitions and P_Keys

  When the IPoIB driver is loaded, it creates one interface for each
  port using the P_Key at index 0.  To create an interface with a
  different P_Key, write the desired P_Key into the main interface's
  /sys/class/net/<intf name>/create_child file.  For example:

    echo 0x8001 > /sys/class/net/ib0/create_child

  This will create an interface named ib0.8001 with P_Key 0x8001.  To
  remove a subinterface, use the "delete_child" file:

    echo 0x8001 > /sys/class/net/ib0/delete_child

  The P_Key for any interface is given by the "pkey" file, and the
  main interface for a subinterface is in "parent."

Debugging Information

  By compiling the IPoIB driver with CONFIG_INFINIBAND_IPOIB_DEBUG set
  to 'y', tracing messages are compiled into the driver.  They are
  turned on by setting the module parameters debug_level and
  mcast_debug_level to 1.  These parameters can be controlled at
  runtime through files in /sys/module/ib_ipoib/.

  CONFIG_INFINIBAND_IPOIB_DEBUG also enables files in the debugfs
  virtual filesystem.  By mounting this filesystem, for example with

    mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug

  it is possible to get statistics about multicast groups from the
  files /sys/kernel/debug/ipoib/ib0_mcg and so on.

  The performance impact of this option is negligible, so it
  is safe to enable this option with debug_level set to 0 for normal
  operation.

  CONFIG_INFINIBAND_IPOIB_DEBUG_DATA enables even more debug output in
  the data path when data_debug_level is set to 1.  However, even with
  the output disabled, enabling this configuration option will affect
  performance, because it adds tests to the fast path.
