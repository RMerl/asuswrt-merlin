OCFS2 filesystem
==================
OCFS2 is a general purpose extent based shared disk cluster file
system with many similarities to ext3. It supports 64 bit inode
numbers, and has automatically extending metadata groups which may
also make it attractive for non-clustered use.

You'll want to install the ocfs2-tools package in order to at least
get "mount.ocfs2" and "ocfs2_hb_ctl".

Caveats
=======
Features which OCFS2 does not support yet:
	- sparse files
	- extended attributes
	- shared writable mmap
	- loopback is supported, but data written will not
	  be cluster coherent.
	- quotas
	- cluster aware flock
	- cluster aware lockf
	- Directory change notification (F_NOTIFY)
	- Distributed Caching (F_SETLEASE/F_GETLEASE/break_lease)
	- POSIX ACLs
	- readpages / writepages (not user visible)

Mount options
=============

OCFS2 supports the following mount options:
(*) == default

barrier=1		This enables/disables barriers. barrier=0 disables it,
			barrier=1 enables it.
errors=remount-ro(*)	Remount the filesystem read-only on an error.
errors=panic		Panic and halt the machine if an error occurs.
intr		(*)	Allow signals to interrupt cluster operations.
nointr			Do not allow signals to interrupt cluster
			operations.
atime_quantum=60(*)	OCFS2 will not update atime unless this number
			of seconds has passed since the last update.
			Set to zero to always update atime.
