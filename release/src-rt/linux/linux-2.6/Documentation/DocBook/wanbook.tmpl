      <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
	The syncppp drivers in Linux provide a fairly complete 
	implementation of Cisco HDLC and a minimal implementation of
	PPP. The longer term goal is to switch the PPP layer to the
	generic PPP interface that is new in Linux 2.3.x. The API should
	remain unchanged when this is done, but support will then be
	available for IPX, compression and other PPP features

	Currently we do not end all packets with the correct Cisco multicast
	or unicast flags. Nothing appears to mind too much but this should
	be corrected.
