      <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
	The MCA bus functions provide a generalised interface to find MCA
	bus cards, to claim them for a driver, and to read and manipulate POS 
	registers without being aware of the motherboard internals or 
	certain deep magic specific to onboard devices.
  </para>
  <para>
	The basic interface to the MCA bus devices is the slot. Each slot
	is numbered and virtual slot numbers are assigned to the internal
	devices. Using a pci_dev as other busses do does not really make
	sense in the MCA context as the MCA bus resources require card
	specific interpretation.
  </para>
  <para>
	Finally the MCA bus functions provide a parallel set of DMA
	functions mimicing the ISA bus DMA functions as closely as possible,
	although also supporting the additional DMA functionality on the
	MCA bus controllers.
