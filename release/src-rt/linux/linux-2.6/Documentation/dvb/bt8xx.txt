How to get the bt8xx cards working
==================================

1) General information
======================

This class of cards has a bt878a as the PCI interface, and require the bttv driver
for accessing the i2c bus and the gpio pins of the bt8xx chipset.
Please see Documentation/dvb/cards.txt => o Cards based on the Conexant Bt8xx PCI bridge:

Compiling kernel please enable:
a.)"Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices" => "Video For Linux" => "BT848 Video For Linux"
b.)"Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices" => "Digital Video Broadcasting Devices"
 => "DVB for Linux" "DVB Core Support" "Bt8xx based PCI Cards"

2) Loading Modules
==================

In default cases bttv is loaded automatically.
To load the backend either place dvb-bt8xx in etc/modules, or apply manually:

	$ modprobe dvb-bt8xx

All frontends will be loaded automatically.
People running udev please see Documentation/dvb/udev.txt.

In the following cases overriding the PCI type detection for dvb-bt8xx might be necessary:

2a) Running TwinHan and Clones
------------------------------

	$ modprobe bttv card=113
	$ modprobe dvb-bt8xx
	$ modprobe dst

Useful parameters for verbosity level and debugging the dst module:

verbose=0:		messages are disabled
	1:		only error messages are displayed
	2:		notifications are displayed
	3:		other useful messages are displayed
	4:		debug setting
dst_addons=0:		card is a free to air (FTA) card only
	   0x20:	card has a conditional access slot for scrambled channels

The autodetected values are determined by the cards' "response string".
In your logs see f. ex.: dst_get_device_id: Recognize [DSTMCI].
For bug reports please send in a complete log with verbose=4 activated.
Please also see Documentation/dvb/ci.txt.

2b) Running multiple cards
--------------------------

Examples of card ID's:

Pinnacle PCTV Sat:		 94
Nebula Electronics Digi TV:	104
pcHDTV HD-2000 TV:		112
Twinhan DST and clones:		113
Avermedia AverTV DVB-T 771:	123
Avermedia AverTV DVB-T 761:	124
DViCO FusionHDTV DVB-T Lite:	128
DViCO FusionHDTV 5 Lite:	135

Notice: The order of the card ID should be uprising:
Example:
	$ modprobe bttv card=113 card=135
	$ modprobe dvb-bt8xx

For a full list of card ID's please see Documentation/video4linux/CARDLIST.bttv.
