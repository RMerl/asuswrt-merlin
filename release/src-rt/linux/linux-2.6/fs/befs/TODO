TODO
==========

* Convert comments to the Kernel-Doc format.

* Befs_fs.h has gotten big and messy. No reason not to break it up into 
	smaller peices.

* See if Alexander Viro's option parser made it into the kernel tree. 
	Use that if we can. (include/linux/parser.h)

* See if we really need separate types for on-disk and in-memory 
	representations of the superblock and inode.
