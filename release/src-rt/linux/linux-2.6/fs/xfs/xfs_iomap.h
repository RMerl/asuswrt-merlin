 * xfs_iomap_t:  File system I/O map
 *
 * The iomap_bn field is expressed in 512-byte blocks, and is where the
 * mapping starts on disk.
 *
 * The iomap_offset, iomap_bsize and iomap_delta fields are in bytes.
 * iomap_offset is the offset of the mapping in the file itself.
 * iomap_bsize is the size of the mapping,  iomap_delta is the
 * desired data's offset into the mapping, given the offset supplied
 * to the file I/O map routine.
 *
 * When a request is made to read beyond the logical end of the object,
 * iomap_size may be set to 0, but iomap_offset and iomap_length should be set
 * to the actual amount of underlying storage that has been allocated, if any.
