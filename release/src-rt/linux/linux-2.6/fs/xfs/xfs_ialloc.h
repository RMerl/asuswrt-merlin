 * allocation to make more free inodes.  If an inode is
 * available without an allocation, agbp would be set to the current
 * agbp and alloc_done set to false.
 * If an allocation needed to be done, agbp would be set to the
 * inode header of the allocation group and alloc_done set to true.
 * The caller should then commit the current transaction and allocate a new
 * transaction.  xfs_dialloc() should then be called again with
 * the agbp value returned from the previous call.
 *
 * Once we successfully pick an inode its number is returned and the
 * on-disk data structures are updated.  The inode itself is not read
 * in, since doing so would break ordering constraints with xfs_reclaim.
