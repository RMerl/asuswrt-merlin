/*
 * Header file used to associate behaviors with virtualized objects.
 *
 * A virtualized object is an internal, virtualized representation of
 * OS entities such as persistent files, processes, or sockets.  Examples
 * of virtualized objects include vnodes, vprocs, and vsockets.  Often
 * a virtualized object is referred to simply as an "object."
 *
 * A behavior is essentially an implementation layer associated with
 * an object.  Multiple behaviors for an object are chained together,
 * the order of chaining determining the order of invocation.  Each
 * behavior of a given object implements the same set of interfaces
 * (e.g., the VOP interfaces).
 *
 * Behaviors may be dynamically inserted into an object's behavior chain,
 * such that the addition is transparent to consumers that already have
 * references to the object.  Typically, a given behavior will be inserted
 * at a particular location in the behavior chain.  Insertion of new
 * behaviors is synchronized with operations-in-progress (oip's) so that
 * the oip's always see a consistent view of the chain.
 *
 * The term "interposition" is used to refer to the act of inserting
 * a behavior such that it interposes on (i.e., is inserted in front
 * of) a particular other behavior.  A key example of this is when a
 * system implementing distributed single system image wishes to
 * interpose a distribution layer (providing distributed coherency)
 * in front of an object that is otherwise only accessed locally.
 *
 * Note that the traditional vnode/inode combination is simply a virtualized
 * object that has exactly one associated behavior.
 *
 * Behavior synchronization is logic which is necessary under certain
 * circumstances that there is no conflict between ongoing operations
 * traversing the behavior chain and those dynamically modifying the
 * behavior chain.  Because behavior synchronization adds extra overhead
 * to virtual operation invocation, we want to restrict, as much as
 * we can, the requirement for this extra code, to those situations
 * in which it is truly necessary.
 *
 * Behavior synchronization is needed whenever there's at least one class
 * of object in the system for which:
 * 1) multiple behaviors for a given object are supported,
 * -- AND --
 * 2a) insertion of a new behavior can happen dynamically at any time during
 *     the life of an active object,
 *	-- AND --
 *	3a) insertion of a new behavior needs to synchronize with existing
 *	    ops-in-progress.
 *	-- OR --
 *	3b) multiple different behaviors can be dynamically inserted at
 *	    any time during the life of an active object
 *	-- OR --
 *	3c) removal of a behavior can occur at any time during the life of
 *	    an active object.
 * -- OR --
 * 2b) removal of a behavior can occur at any time during the life of an
 *     active object
