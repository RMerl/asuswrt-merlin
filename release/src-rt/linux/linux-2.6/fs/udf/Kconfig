	  This is the new file system used on some CD-ROMs and DVDs. Say Y if
	  you intend to mount DVD discs or CDRW's written in packet mode, or
	  if written to by other UDF utilities, such as DirectCD.
	  Please read <file:Documentation/filesystems/udf.txt>.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called udf.

	  If unsure, say N.

config UDF_NLS
	bool
	default y
	depends on (UDF_FS=m && NLS) || (UDF_FS=y && NLS=y)
