/******************** PROBLEMS!!! *******************

- Code compares vs. dirty_size, not free+dirty, to decide if doing GC
  will help.  (fmc->dirty_size < fmc->sector_size)
  Free blocks:  2   Free+dirty blocks: 3  <------- should do GC.

- I think the minimum free size is 2 EBs (see below) in the normal
  case.  this. Must test!!

  But on a file rename, it might be more, since all the file's data
  nodes must be re-written larger.  Maybe we don't much care, since
  this is a router---we'll just warn people to not do that.

- Worst case necessary # of free blocks is: 1 for a full head block +
  1/2 for any nodes that start on the head block but span into the
  next block.  Round up: 2.

  HOWEVER: if we either dis-allow a node to span blocks,
  then we don't need this extra free block.  Maybe.
  NOTE that this is essentially what we do when we're
  re-writing a node when the new size would be > max_chunk_size.  I
  think that at the end of flash, we bypass (make dirty) a chunk of
  flash that we deem to be "too small to be useful".  That is
  certainly what we do on a write_node.  If we split a spanning node
  during a GC, we could allow the initial write to span, thus leaving
  that code alone.
  This would have to be carefully tested!!!

 
- Make special case code for very small filesystem size, to allow for
  1 or even 0 reserved EBs.  This may be an in-place write, which is
  slow and not rebust.  A power failure during the erase/write will
  corrupt the fs.

- Maybe can keep GC'ing and get it so used_head is < free_tail, and
  free up a block.  Unknown if this is possible without actually
  trying to GC a few times.

- GC thread should run periodically, to change dirty into free during
  idle periods.  When things are *very* idle, it should GC until all
  the dirty is together in the head block.  This will give us a head
  start the next time a GC is required.  Thinking about: do a timer in
  gc_thread.  Exponential increase up to maybe 10-20 minutes.  Gets
  set back to 100 msec (??  One second?)  whenever main code decides
  it should trigger GC_thread.  At the max timeout, that's when we
  should aggressively GC to combine all the dirty into one.  That's
  when the head node is dirty and its size is dirty_size.

  All this is merely an optimization.  As long as anything gets
  written to the jffs, then blocks will be dirtied and the GC will
  have to be done at some time anyway.  This just gets the GC done
  sooner, hopefully before it is required.  If required, then a write
  will be delayed while the GC is done to make room for the data being
  written.  This delay is about 1 second for each flash block that
  must be erased.  Far better to do the GC's before they are required!

  GC_trigger can then be sloppy.  It would no longer be so important
  to wake the GC thread, because we know that a GC pass will happen
  eventually.  Heck, we could always trigger when we write.

============================================

- *FIXED When GC moves a file off of the head page, it copies the
whole file, even those parts that are on a different page.  Ver gets
bumped.  Nodes get merged--up to 32KB max,

- *FIXED GC actually does: from the file_offset in the 1st (oldest)
node, copy the next N bytes of the file to the tail.  Wrong thing to
do.  N is capped at: max_chunk_size (32kb), or end-of-flash, or
end-of-file.

a) It copies data that might be on a different block, thereby creating
deeply buried dirty nodes.

b) If there is another node in the headpage with a smaller
file-offset, we don't handle that now.  If the file was written
backward, it might be a long time before these get merged.  If they do
get merged in this pass, the earlier node (with the larger file
offset) will get copied twice, thereby creating an unnecessary dirty
node.  Once in it's own right, and once more when it gets merged.

c) If there is a hole in the file, all those empty bytes will be
written out (as zero).  This will create busy node(s) that didn't
previously exist.  (This is a node with node->fm == NULL).

We *do* want to merge, because that deletes a node header.  As we
re-write nodes, one occasionally gets split because it hits a boundary
(like end-of-flash).  If we don't ever merge, we'll keep splitting
blocks and hence adding node-headers forever.

What it *should* do is: Get the file to which the oldest node belongs,
then skip backwards in nodes to find the node for that file which is
on the head block with the smallest file_offset.  Maybe it's this
node, maybe it's a later (physical) node. Doesn't matter---we'll still
be moving a node off the nead block.

Starting from that node, find the N that also is capped/constrained by
a node whose flash_offset is on the head block.  Worst case is that
there are no other such nodes, so no merge happens.  Best case is that
we hit one of the other caps while we are still on the head block.
This is what actually is the case when a file is written normally,
from 0 to EOF.

Also, stop on a file node that represents a hole (fm == 0).  We don't
want to expand out the 0 bytes that are a hole.

If we want to get frisky, we could allow up to N bytes from node(s)
that are on the next M flash block(s).  Probably want to limit M to 1,
and N to only entire node(s) up to PAGESIZE (4kb).  But remember that
doing this will create some dirt (or not a dirty node but obsoleted
data) deeper in the flash, which will *not* be erased in this GC pass.
So maybe we'd only do this if we had plenty of unused free space and
[something].  Maybe we'd do this only if we didn't merge any nodes that
are on the head block *and* the next node is on the next physical block.
Someday, perhaps.....


- *FIXED If you GC when there are no used nodes, and free wraps around,
the next allocs go to 0 (free2), instead of free1.
*FIXED.  It did not reset tail = head.

/*
  GC works by moving busy nodes from the head to the tail, thereby making
  the nodes in the head block dirty.  When the entire head block is dirty, the
  block is erased and added to free.

  Conditions:

  1) Used_on_head (including any nodes that span into the
  next block or other blocks) is <= free space on the tail block.
    -- # of free blocks needed: 0

  2) Used_on_head is > free_on_tail.  But is small.
  -- # of free blocks needed: 1

  3) Used_on_head is > free_on_tail and is large.  Used could be as
  much as one entire block + up to 32KB that spans into next block.
  Only 32KB because max node size is 32kb.
  -- # of free blocks needed: 2

  4) Rename file to longer name.  Must re-write every node, making
  each one larger.

  5) When copying nodes to tail, merge adjacent nodes with adjacent
  data.  Up to 32kb (max node size).  Or up to end of flash.

  6) When copying node to tail, it might run into the end of flash,
  when free wraps around to offset 0.  The node must be split -OR- we
  dirty out the remainder of last flash block and put the entire node
  at the satrt of flash.
    -- # of free blocks needed: 1 extra ?

/* jffs_garbage_collect_next implements one step in the garbage collect
   process and is often called multiple times at each occasion of a
   garbage collect.

   This will rotate nodes of the first file in the flash to the end,
   thereby getting them off the head block.  After all the nodes have
   been moved off the head block, it will be all dirty and can be
   erased and added to free.

   Depending on alignment & fragmentation, even if dirty is less than
   blocksize, we might be able to free a block.  If free and
   free+dirty are the same # of blocks, we can't.  But if free+dirty
   is more blocks than free, we can.

   If we only re-write data that is on the head block, we know that
   worst-case we won't write more than one block.  If a node spans
   into the next block (which we don't allow anymore) then the
   worst-case is one block PLUS the max node size (for the case where
   only 1 byte is on this block and the rest has spanned into the next
   block) or 1 + 1/2 block.  This would make the minimum reserve to be
   2 blocks.  If we don't allow span, the worst case is 1 block.

   This means that sometimes when we re-write data, we'll have to
   split a node that otherwise would span into the next block.  During
   GC, e don't (normally) copy data that is on another block, since
   that results in a dirty node that is on another block, thereby
   consuming flash that we can't free up yet.  However, this means
   that we will split one node into two nodes (on different blocks),
   but will never merge them, since they'll always be on different
   blocks.

   Hence, "merge_obn" which tells us how aggressive we should be with
   merging in nodes that are on a different block than the head block.
   If zero, this is an emergency GC to make room for a new node that
   is being written to the fs.  In this case, we cannot afford to
   created extra dirt by copying data from another block.
   
   The other cases are:
   a) include *one* node that is on the *next*
   physical block, regardless of size.  This would pick up the case
   where a node got split due to spanning a block.
   b) include a small node regardless of where it is.  This will
   slowly merge small nodes.  If there is a case where there are small nodes.

   Each of these will create dirt and therefore extra flash.  In (a),
   we'll collect that dirt on the next GC, so it won't be around very
   long.  In (b), the dirt may be far away and therefore live for a
   long time.  But it's small, so shouldn't hurt much.

   a part of the raw inode as well.  If the box is power cycled during
   the first phase, only the checksum of this node-to-be-cleared-at-

   the clearing of the raw inode, the information like the length of
   the name and data parts are zeroed.  The next time the box is
   powered up, the scanning algorithm manages this faulty data too
   because:

   - The checksum is invalid and thus the raw inode must be discarded
   in any case.
   - If the lengths of the data part or the name part are zeroed, the
   scanning just continues after the raw inode.  But after the inode
   the scanning procedure just finds zeroes which is the same as
   dirt.

/* Background garbase collection is only an optimization, not necessary.  We do it
   after something has been modified in the fs.  When no nore modifications have
   happened for a while, we GC in the background, to clear out the garbage so
   that we can (hopefully) avoid having to do a GC the next time a write takes place.

   The longer it has been since a write, the more aggreesive we are in the
   garbage collection.   The theory is: we are going to have to do garbage collection
   and erasing flash blocks anyway, so let's do it *before* it will become necessary.
   The only time that we might wind up doing a gratuitous Gc & erase is when it has been
   a long long time since the last write.  That's when we will do a GC which will convert
   dirty space to free even though it won't allow us to pick up an entire free block.  I've
   decided that it is worthwhile to get more free, so that it will be immediately
   usable whenever the next write eventually occurs.
   
   Each call to jffs_garbage_collect_next will rotate some of the file that is
   the first node in the flash to the end, thereby getting it off the head block.
   After all the nodes have been moved off the head block, it will be all dirty and can be
   erased and added to free.

   Depending on alignment & fragmentation, even if dirty is less than blocksize, we
   might be able to free a block.  Also, wasted bytes are dirty but are within a non-dirty node.

   It might not be possible to (reasonably) free up all of the dirty nodes, depending
   on the exact placement of the nodes.  A collect moves a busy node but makes the old node
   dirty, thereby temporarily increasing the dirty_size.  So we stop when the dirty node
   placement is optimal:  all at the beginning of the head block.  This placement will allow
   the head block to quickly get erased when the user starts writing files.
