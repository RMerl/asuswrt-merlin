 *
 * 1 July 2001: @@@ FIXME:
 *   In journalled data mode, a data buffer may be metadata against the
 *   current transaction.  But the same file is part of a shared mapping
 *   and someone does a writepage() on it.
 *
 *   We will move the buffer onto the async_data list, but *after* it has
 *   been dirtied. So there's a small window where we have dirty data on
 *   BJ_Metadata.
 *
 *   Note that this only applies to the last partial page in the file.  The
 *   bit which block_write_full_page() uses prepare/commit for.  (That's
 *   broken code anyway: it's wrong for msync()).
 *
 *   It's a rare case: affects the final partial page, for journalled data
 *   where the file is subject to bith write() and writepage() in the same
 *   transction.  To fix it we'll need a custom block_write_full_page().
 *   We'll probably need that anyway for journalling writepage() output.
 *
 * We don't honour synchronous mounts for writepage().  That would be
 * disastrous.  Any write() or metadata operation will sync the fs for
 * us.
 *
 * AKPM2: if all the page's buffers are mapped to disk and !data=journal,

 *
 * Note that at recovery time, journal replay occurs *before* the restart of
 * truncate against the orphan inode list.
 *
 * The committed inode has the new, desired i_size (which is the same as
