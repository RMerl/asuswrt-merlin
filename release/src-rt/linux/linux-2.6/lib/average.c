/**
 * DOC: Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)
 *
 * These are generic functions for calculating Exponentially Weighted Moving
 * Averages (EWMA). We keep a structure with the EWMA parameters and a scaled
 * up internal representation of the average value to prevent rounding errors.
 * The factor for scaling up and the exponential weight (or decay rate) have to
 * be specified thru the init fuction. The structure should not be accessed
 * directly but only thru the helper functions.

/**
 * ewma_init() - Initialize EWMA parameters
 * @avg: Average structure
 * @factor: Factor to use for the scaled up internal value. The maximum value
 *	of averages can be ULONG_MAX/(factor*weight). For performance reasons
 *	factor has to be a power of 2.
 * @weight: Exponential weight, or decay rate. This defines how fast the
 *	influence of older values decreases. For performance reasons weight has
 *	to be a power of 2.
