Introduction
************

This manual documents the internals of the GNU compilers, including how
to port them to new targets and some information about how to write
front ends for new languages.  It corresponds to GCC version 3.4.6.
The use of the GNU compilers is documented in a separate manual.  *Note
Introduction: (gcc)Top.

   This manual is mainly a reference manual rather than a tutorial.  It
discusses how to contribute to GCC (*note Contributing::), the
characteristics of the machines supported by GCC as hosts and targets
(*note Portability::), how GCC relates to the ABIs on such systems
(*note Interface::), and the characteristics of the languages for which
GCC front ends are written (*note Languages::).  It then describes the
GCC source tree structure and build system, some of the interfaces to
GCC front ends, and how support for a target system is implemented in
GCC.

   Additional tutorial information is linked to from
`http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html'.

2 GCC and Portability
*********************

GCC itself aims to be portable to any machine where `int' is at least a
32-bit type.  It aims to target machines with a flat (non-segmented)
byte addressed data address space (the code address space can be
separate).  Target ABIs may have 8, 16, 32 or 64-bit `int' type. `char'
can be wider than 8 bits.

   GCC gets most of the information about the target machine from a
machine description which gives an algebraic formula for each of the
machine's instructions.  This is a very clean way to describe the
target.  But when the compiler needs information that is difficult to
express in this fashion, ad-hoc parameters have been defined for
machine descriptions.  The purpose of portability is to reduce the
total work needed on the compiler; it was not of interest for its own
sake.

   GCC does not contain machine dependent code, but it does contain code
that depends on machine parameters such as endianness (whether the most
significant byte has the highest or lowest address of the bytes in a
word) and the availability of autoincrement addressing.  In the
RTL-generation pass, it is often necessary to have multiple strategies
for generating code for a particular kind of syntax tree, strategies
that are usable for different combinations of parameters.  Often, not
all possible cases have been addressed, but only the common ones or
only the ones that have been encountered.  As a result, a new target
may require additional strategies.  You will know if this happens
because the compiler will call `abort'.  Fortunately, the new
strategies can be added in a machine-independent fashion, and will
affect only the target machines that need them.

3 Interfacing to GCC Output
***************************

GCC is normally configured to use the same function calling convention
normally in use on the target system.  This is done with the
machine-description macros described (*note Target Macros::).

   However, returning of structure and union values is done differently
on some target machines.  As a result, functions compiled with PCC
returning such types cannot be called from code compiled with GCC, and
vice versa.  This does not cause trouble often because few Unix library
routines return structures or unions.

   GCC code returns structures and unions that are 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes
long in the same registers used for `int' or `double' return values.
(GCC typically allocates variables of such types in registers also.)
Structures and unions of other sizes are returned by storing them into
an address passed by the caller (usually in a register).  The target
hook `TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX' tells GCC where to pass this address.

   By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and
unions of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage,
and then returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer
value.  The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the
place where the value is wanted.  This is slower than the method used
by GCC, and fails to be reentrant.

   On some target machines, such as RISC machines and the 80386, the
standard system convention is to pass to the subroutine the address of
where to return the value.  On these machines, GCC has been configured
to be compatible with the standard compiler, when this method is used.
It may not be compatible for structures of 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.

   GCC uses the system's standard convention for passing arguments.  On
some machines, the first few arguments are passed in registers; in
others, all are passed on the stack.  It would be possible to use
registers for argument passing on any machine, and this would probably
result in a significant speedup.  But the result would be complete
incompatibility with code that follows the standard convention.  So this
change is practical only if you are switching to GCC as the sole C
compiler for the system.  We may implement register argument passing on
certain machines once we have a complete GNU system so that we can
compile the libraries with GCC.

   On some machines (particularly the SPARC), certain types of arguments
are passed "by invisible reference".  This means that the value is
stored in memory, and the address of the memory location is passed to
the subroutine.

   If you use `longjmp', beware of automatic variables.  ISO C says that
automatic variables that are not declared `volatile' have undefined
values after a `longjmp'.  And this is all GCC promises to do, because
it is very difficult to restore register variables correctly, and one
of GCC's features is that it can put variables in registers without
your asking it to.

   If you want a variable to be unaltered by `longjmp', and you don't
want to write `volatile' because old C compilers don't accept it, just
take the address of the variable.  If a variable's address is ever
taken, even if just to compute it and ignore it, then the variable
cannot go in a register:

     {
       int careful;
       &careful;
       ...
     }

4 The GCC low-level runtime library
***********************************

GCC provides a low-level runtime library, `libgcc.a' or `libgcc_s.so.1'
on some platforms.  GCC generates calls to routines in this library
automatically, whenever it needs to perform some operation that is too
complicated to emit inline code for.

   Most of the routines in `libgcc' handle arithmetic operations that
the target processor cannot perform directly.  This includes integer
multiply and divide on some machines, and all floating-point operations
on other machines.  `libgcc' also includes routines for exception
handling, and a handful of miscellaneous operations.

   Some of these routines can be defined in mostly machine-independent
C.  Others must be hand-written in assembly language for each processor
that needs them.

   GCC will also generate calls to C library routines, such as `memcpy'
and `memset', in some cases.  The set of routines that GCC may possibly
use is documented in *Note Other Builtins: (gcc)Other Builtins.

   These routines take arguments and return values of a specific machine
mode, not a specific C type.  *Note Machine Modes::, for an explanation
of this concept.  For illustrative purposes, in this chapter the
floating point type `float' is assumed to correspond to `SFmode';
`double' to `DFmode'; and `long double' to both `TFmode' and `XFmode'.
Similarly, the integer types `int' and `unsigned int' correspond to
`SImode'; `long' and `unsigned long' to `DImode'; and `long long' and
`unsigned long long' to `TImode'.

4.1 Routines for integer arithmetic
===================================

The integer arithmetic routines are used on platforms that don't provide
hardware support for arithmetic operations on some modes.

4.1.1 Arithmetic functions
--------------------------

     These functions return the remainder of the unsigned division of A
     and B.

4.1.2 Comparison functions
--------------------------

The following functions implement integral comparisons.  These functions
implement a low-level compare, upon which the higher level comparison
operators (such as less than and greater than or equal to) can be
constructed.  The returned values lie in the range zero to two, to allow
the high-level operators to be implemented by testing the returned
result using either signed or unsigned comparison.

 -- Runtime Function: int __cmpdi2 (long A, long B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __cmpti2 (long long A, long long B)
     These functions perform a signed comparison of A and B.  If A is
     less than B, they return 0; if A is greater than B, they return 2;
     and if A and B are equal they return 1.

 -- Runtime Function: int __ucmpdi2 (unsigned long A, unsigned long B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __ucmpti2 (unsigned long long A, unsigned
          long long B)
     These functions perform an unsigned comparison of A and B.  If A
     is less than B, they return 0; if A is greater than B, they return
     2; and if A and B are equal they return 1.

 -- Runtime Function: int __ffsti2 (long long A)
     These functions return the index of the least significant 1-bit in
     A, or the value zero if A is zero.  The least significant bit is
     index one.

 -- Runtime Function: int __paritysi2 (int A)
 -- Runtime Function: int __paritydi2 (long A)
 -- Runtime Function: int __parityti2 (long long A)

4.2 Routines for floating point emulation
=========================================

The software floating point library is used on machines which do not
have hardware support for floating point.  It is also used whenever
`-msoft-float' is used to disable generation of floating point
instructions.  (Not all targets support this switch.)

   For compatibility with other compilers, the floating point emulation
routines can be renamed with the `DECLARE_LIBRARY_RENAMES' macro (*note
Library Calls::).  In this section, the default names are used.

   Presently the library does not support `XFmode', which is used for

 -- Runtime Function: long double __floattixf (long long I)
     These functions convert I, a signed long long, to floating point.

4.2.3 Comparison functions
--------------------------

There are two sets of basic comparison functions.

 -- Runtime Function: int __cmpsf2 (float A, float B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __cmpdf2 (double A, double B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __cmptf2 (long double A, long double B)
     These functions calculate a <=> b.  That is, if A is less than B,
     they return -1; if A is greater than B, they return 1; and if A
     and B are equal they return 0.  If either argument is NaN they
     return 1, but you should not rely on this; if NaN is a
     possibility, use one of the higher-level comparison functions.

 -- Runtime Function: int __unordsf2 (float A, float B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __unorddf2 (double A, double B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __unordtf2 (long double A, long double B)
     These functions return a nonzero value if either argument is NaN,
     otherwise 0.

   There is also a complete group of higher level functions which
correspond directly to comparison operators.  They implement the ISO C
semantics for floating-point comparisons, taking NaN into account.  Pay
careful attention to the return values defined for each set.  Under the
hood, all of these routines are implemented as

       if (__unordXf2 (a, b))
         return E;
       return __cmpXf2 (a, b);

where E is a constant chosen to give the proper behavior for NaN.
Thus, the meaning of the return value is different for each set.  Do
not rely on this implementation; only the semantics documented below
are guaranteed.

 -- Runtime Function: int __eqsf2 (float A, float B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __eqdf2 (double A, double B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __eqtf2 (long double A, long double B)
     These functions return zero if neither argument is NaN, and A and
     B are equal.

 -- Runtime Function: int __nesf2 (float A, float B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __nedf2 (double A, double B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __netf2 (long double A, long double B)
     These functions return a nonzero value if either argument is NaN,
     or if A and B are unequal.

 -- Runtime Function: int __gesf2 (float A, float B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __gedf2 (double A, double B)

5 Language Front Ends in GCC
****************************

The interface to front ends for languages in GCC, and in particular the
`tree' structure (*note Trees::), was initially designed for C, and
many aspects of it are still somewhat biased towards C and C-like
languages.  It is, however, reasonably well suited to other procedural
languages, and front ends for many such languages have been written for
GCC.

   Writing a compiler as a front end for GCC, rather than compiling
directly to assembler or generating C code which is then compiled by
GCC, has several advantages:

   * GCC front ends benefit from the support for many different target
     machines already present in GCC.

   * GCC front ends benefit from all the optimizations in GCC.  Some of
     these, such as alias analysis, may work better when GCC is
     compiling directly from source code then when it is compiling from
     generated C code.

   * Better debugging information is generated when compiling directly
     from source code than when going via intermediate generated C code.

   Because of the advantages of writing a compiler as a GCC front end,
GCC front ends have also been created for languages very different from
those for which GCC was designed, such as the declarative
logic/functional language Mercury.  For these reasons, it may also be
useful to implement compilers created for specialized purposes (for
example, as part of a research project) as GCC front ends.

6 Source Tree Structure and Build System
****************************************

This chapter describes the structure of the GCC source tree, and how
GCC is built.  The user documentation for building and installing GCC
is in a separate manual (`http://gcc.gnu.org/install/'), with which it
is presumed that you are familiar.

* Menu:

* Configure Terms:: Configuration terminology and history.
* Top Level::       The top level source directory.
* gcc Directory::   The `gcc' subdirectory.
* Testsuites::      The GCC testsuites.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Configure Terms,  Next: Top Level,  Up: Source Tree

6.1 Configure Terms and History
===============================

The configure and build process has a long and colorful history, and can
be confusing to anyone who doesn't know why things are the way they are.
While there are other documents which describe the configuration process
in detail, here are a few things that everyone working on GCC should
know.

   There are three system names that the build knows about: the machine
you are building on ("build"), the machine that you are building for
("host"), and the machine that GCC will produce code for ("target").
When you configure GCC, you specify these with `--build=', `--host=',
and `--target='.

   Specifying the host without specifying the build should be avoided,
as `configure' may (and once did) assume that the host you specify is
also the build, which may not be true.

   If build, host, and target are all the same, this is called a
"native".  If build and host are the same but target is different, this
is called a "cross".  If build, host, and target are all different this
is called a "canadian" (for obscure reasons dealing with Canada's
political party and the background of the person working on the build
at that time).  If host and target are the same, but build is
different, you are using a cross-compiler to build a native for a
different system.  Some people call this a "host-x-host", "crossed
native", or "cross-built native".  If build and target are the same,
but host is different, you are using a cross compiler to build a cross
compiler that produces code for the machine you're building on.  This
is rare, so there is no common way of describing it.  There is a
proposal to call this a "crossback".

   If build and host are the same, the GCC you are building will also be
used to build the target libraries (like `libstdc++').  If build and
host are different, you must have already build and installed a cross
compiler that will be used to build the target libraries (if you
configured with `--target=foo-bar', this compiler will be called
`foo-bar-gcc').

   In the case of target libraries, the machine you're building for is
the machine you specified with `--target'.  So, build is the machine
you're building on (no change there), host is the machine you're
building for (the target libraries are built for the target, so host is
the target you specified), and target doesn't apply (because you're not
building a compiler, you're building libraries).  The configure/make
process will adjust these variables as needed.  It also sets
`$with_cross_host' to the original `--host' value in case you need it.

   The `libiberty' support library is built up to three times: once for
the host, once for the target (even if they are the same), and once for
the build if build and host are different.  This allows it to be used
by all programs which are generated in the course of the build process.

6.2 Top Level Source Directory
==============================

The top level source directory in a GCC distribution contains several
files and directories that are shared with other software distributions
such as that of GNU Binutils.  It also contains several subdirectories
that contain parts of GCC and its runtime libraries:

`boehm-gc'
     The Boehm conservative garbage collector, used as part of the Java
     runtime library.

`contrib'
     Contributed scripts that may be found useful in conjunction with
     GCC.  One of these, `contrib/texi2pod.pl', is used to generate man
     pages from Texinfo manuals as part of the GCC build process.

`fastjar'
     An implementation of the `jar' command, used with the Java front
     end.

`gcc'
     The main sources of GCC itself (except for runtime libraries),
     including optimizers, support for different target architectures,
     language front ends, and testsuites.  *Note The `gcc'
     Subdirectory: gcc Directory, for details.

`include'
     Headers for the `libiberty' library.

`libf2c'
     The Fortran runtime library.

`libffi'
     The `libffi' library, used as part of the Java runtime library.

`libiberty'
     The `libiberty' library, used for portability and for some
     generally useful data structures and algorithms.  *Note
     Introduction: (libiberty)Top, for more information about this
     library.

`libjava'
     The Java runtime library.

`libobjc'
     The Objective-C runtime library.

`libstdc++-v3'
     The C++ runtime library.

`maintainer-scripts'
     Scripts used by the `gccadmin' account on `gcc.gnu.org'.

`zlib'
     The `zlib' compression library, used by the Java front end and as
     part of the Java runtime library.

   The build system in the top level directory, including how recursion
into subdirectories works and how building runtime libraries for
multilibs is handled, is documented in a separate manual, included with
GNU Binutils.  *Note GNU configure and build system: (configure)Top,
for details.

6.3 The `gcc' Subdirectory
==========================

The `gcc' directory contains many files that are part of the C sources
of GCC, other files used as part of the configuration and build
process, and subdirectories including documentation and a testsuite.
The files that are sources of GCC are documented in a separate chapter.
*Note Passes and Files of the Compiler: Passes.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Subdirectories,  Next: Configuration,  Up: gcc Directory

6.3.1 Subdirectories of `gcc'
-----------------------------

The `gcc' directory contains the following subdirectories:

`LANGUAGE'
     Subdirectories for various languages.  Directories containing a
     file `config-lang.in' are language subdirectories.  The contents of
     the subdirectories `cp' (for C++) and `objc' (for Objective-C) are
     documented in this manual (*note Passes and Files of the Compiler:
     Passes.); those for other languages are not.  *Note Anatomy of a
     Language Front End: Front End, for details of the files in these
     directories.

`config'
     Configuration files for supported architectures and operating
     systems.  *Note Anatomy of a Target Back End: Back End, for
     details of the files in this directory.

`doc'
     Texinfo documentation for GCC, together with automatically
     generated man pages and support for converting the installation
     manual to HTML.  *Note Documentation::.

`fixinc'
     The support for fixing system headers to work with GCC.  See
     `fixinc/README' for more information.  The headers fixed by this
     mechanism are installed in `LIBSUBDIR/include'.  Along with those
     headers, `README-fixinc' is also installed, as
     `LIBSUBDIR/include/README'.

`ginclude'
     System headers installed by GCC, mainly those required by the C
     standard of freestanding implementations.  *Note Headers Installed
     by GCC: Headers, for details of when these and other headers are
     installed.

`intl'
     GNU `libintl', from GNU `gettext', for systems which do not
     include it in libc.  Properly, this directory should be at top
     level, parallel to the `gcc' directory.

`po'
     Message catalogs with translations of messages produced by GCC into
     various languages, `LANGUAGE.po'.  This directory also contains
     `gcc.pot', the template for these message catalogues, `exgettext',
     a wrapper around `gettext' to extract the messages from the GCC
     sources and create `gcc.pot', which is run by `make gcc.pot', and
     `EXCLUDES', a list of files from which messages should not be
     extracted.

`testsuite'
     The GCC testsuites (except for those for runtime libraries).
     *Note Testsuites::.

6.3.2 Configuration in the `gcc' Directory
------------------------------------------

The `gcc' directory is configured with an Autoconf-generated script
`configure'.  The `configure' script is generated from `configure.ac'
and `aclocal.m4'.  From the files `configure.ac' and `acconfig.h',
Autoheader generates the file `config.in'.  The file `cstamp-h.in' is
used as a timestamp.

* Menu:

* Config Fragments::     Scripts used by `configure'.
* System Config::        The `config.build', `config.host', and
                         `config.gcc' files.
* Configuration Files::  Files created by running `configure'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Config Fragments,  Next: System Config,  Up: Configuration

6.3.2.1 Scripts Used by `configure'
...................................

`configure' uses some other scripts to help in its work:

   * The standard GNU `config.sub' and `config.guess' files, kept in
     the top level directory, are used.  FIXME: when is the
     `config.guess' file in the `gcc' directory (that just calls the
     top level one) used?

   * The file `config.gcc' is used to handle configuration specific to
     the particular target machine.  The file `config.build' is used to
     handle configuration specific to the particular build machine.
     The file `config.host' is used to handle configuration specific to
     the particular host machine.  (In general, these should only be
     used for features that cannot reasonably be tested in Autoconf
     feature tests.)  *Note The `config.build'; `config.host'; and
     `config.gcc' Files: System Config, for details of the contents of
     these files.

   * Each language subdirectory has a file `LANGUAGE/config-lang.in'
     that is used for front-end-specific configuration.  *Note The
     Front End `config-lang.in' File: Front End Config, for details of
     this file.

   * A helper script `configure.frag' is used as part of creating the
     output of `configure'.

6.3.2.2 The `config.build'; `config.host'; and `config.gcc' Files
.................................................................

The `config.build' file contains specific rules for particular systems
which GCC is built on.  This should be used as rarely as possible, as
the behavior of the build system can always be detected by autoconf.

   The `config.host' file contains specific rules for particular systems
which GCC will run on.  This is rarely needed.

   The `config.gcc' file contains specific rules for particular systems
which GCC will generate code for.  This is usually needed.

   Each file has a list of the shell variables it sets, with
descriptions, at the top of the file.

   FIXME: document the contents of these files, and what variables
should be set to control build, host and target configuration.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Configuration Files,  Prev: System Config,  Up: Configuration

6.3.2.3 Files Created by `configure'
....................................

Here we spell out what files will be set up by `configure' in the `gcc'
directory.  Some other files are created as temporary files in the
configuration process, and are not used in the subsequent build; these
are not documented.

   * `Makefile' is constructed from `Makefile.in', together with the
     host and target fragments (*note Makefile Fragments: Fragments.)
     `t-TARGET' and `x-HOST' from `config', if any, and language
     Makefile fragments `LANGUAGE/Make-lang.in'.

   * `auto-host.h' contains information about the host machine
     determined by `configure'.  If the host machine is different from
     the build machine, then `auto-build.h' is also created, containing
     such information about the build machine.

   * `config.status' is a script that may be run to recreate the
     current configuration.

   * `configargs.h' is a header containing details of the arguments
     passed to `configure' to configure GCC, and of the thread model
     used.

   * `cstamp-h' is used as a timestamp.

   * `fixinc/Makefile' is constructed from `fixinc/Makefile.in'.

   * `gccbug', a script for reporting bugs in GCC, is constructed from
     `gccbug.in'.

   * `intl/Makefile' is constructed from `intl/Makefile.in'.

   * `mklibgcc', a shell script to create a Makefile to build libgcc,
     is constructed from `mklibgcc.in'.

   * If a language `config-lang.in' file (*note The Front End
     `config-lang.in' File: Front End Config.) sets `outputs', then the
     files listed in `outputs' there are also generated.

   The following configuration headers are created from the Makefile,
using `mkconfig.sh', rather than directly by `configure'.  `config.h',
`bconfig.h' and `tconfig.h' all contain the `xm-MACHINE.h' header, if
any, appropriate to the host, build and target machines respectively,
the configuration headers for the target, and some definitions; for the
host and build machines, these include the autoconfigured headers
generated by `configure'.  The other configuration headers are
determined by `config.gcc'.  They also contain the typedefs for `rtx',
`rtvec' and `tree'.

   * `config.h', for use in programs that run on the host machine.

   * `bconfig.h', for use in programs that run on the build machine.

   * `tconfig.h', for use in programs and libraries for the target
     machine.

   * `tm_p.h', which includes the header `MACHINE-protos.h' that
     contains prototypes for functions in the target `.c' file.  FIXME:
     why is such a separate header necessary?

6.3.3 Build System in the `gcc' Directory
-----------------------------------------

FIXME: describe the build system, including what is built in what
stages.  Also list the various source files that are used in the build
process but aren't source files of GCC itself and so aren't documented
below (*note Passes::).


File: gccint.info,  Node: Makefile,  Next: Library Files,  Prev: Build,  Up: gcc Directory

6.3.4 Makefile Targets
----------------------

`all'
     This is the default target.  Depending on what your
     build/host/target configuration is, it coordinates all the things
     that need to be built.

`doc'
     Produce info-formatted documentation and man pages.  Essentially it
     calls `make man' and `make info'.

`dvi'
     Produce DVI-formatted documentation.

`man'
     Generate man pages.

`info'
     Generate info-formatted pages.

`mostlyclean'
     Delete the files made while building the compiler.

`clean'
     That, and all the other files built by `make all'.

`distclean'
     That, and all the files created by `configure'.

`maintainer-clean'
     Distclean plus any file that can be generated from other files.
     Note that additional tools may be required beyond what is normally
     needed to build gcc.

`srcextra'
     Generates files in the source directory that do not exist in CVS
     but should go into a release tarball.  One example is
     `gcc/c-parse.c' which is generated from the CVS source file
     `gcc/c-parse.in'.

`srcinfo'
`srcman'
     Copies the info-formatted and manpage documentation into the source
     directory usually for the purpose of generating a release tarball.

`install'
     Installs gcc.

`uninstall'
     Deletes installed files.

`check'
     Run the testsuite.  This creates a `testsuite' subdirectory that
     has various `.sum' and `.log' files containing the results of the
     testing.  You can run subsets with, for example, `make check-gcc'.
     You can specify specific tests by setting RUNTESTFLAGS to be the
     name of the `.exp' file, optionally followed by (for some tests)
     an equals and a file wildcard, like:

          make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="execute.exp=19980413-*"

     Note that running the testsuite may require additional tools be
     installed, such as TCL or dejagnu.

`bootstrap'
     Builds GCC three times--once with the native compiler, once with
     the native-built compiler it just built, and once with the
     compiler it built the second time.  In theory, the last two should
     produce the same results, which `make compare' can check.  Each
     step of this process is called a "stage", and the results of each
     stage N (N = 1...3) are copied to a subdirectory `stageN/'.

`bootstrap-lean'
     Like `bootstrap', except that the various stages are removed once
     they're no longer needed.  This saves disk space.

`bubblestrap'
     This incrementally rebuilds each of the three stages, one at a
     time.  It does this by "bubbling" the stages up from their
     subdirectories (if they had been built previously), rebuilding
     them, and copying them back to their subdirectories.  This will
     allow you to, for example, continue a bootstrap after fixing a bug
     which causes the stage2 build to crash.

`quickstrap'
     Rebuilds the most recently built stage.  Since each stage requires
     special invocation, using this target means you don't have to keep
     track of which stage you're on or what invocation that stage needs.

`cleanstrap'
     Removed everything (`make clean') and rebuilds (`make bootstrap').

`restrap'
     Like `cleanstrap', except that the process starts from the first
     stage build, not from scratch.

`stageN (N = 1...4)'
     For each stage, moves the appropriate files to the `stageN'
     subdirectory.

`unstageN (N = 1...4)'
     Undoes the corresponding `stageN'.

`restageN (N = 1...4)'
     Undoes the corresponding `stageN' and rebuilds it with the
     appropriate flags.

`compare'
     Compares the results of stages 2 and 3.  This ensures that the
     compiler is running properly, since it should produce the same
     object files regardless of how it itself was compiled.

`profiledbootstrap'
     Builds a compiler with profiling feedback information.  For more
     information, see *Note Building with profile feedback:
     (gccinstall)Building.  This is actually a target in the top-level
     directory, which then recurses into the `gcc' subdirectory
     multiple times.

6.3.5 Library Source Files and Headers under the `gcc' Directory
----------------------------------------------------------------

FIXME: list here, with explanation, all the C source files and headers
under the `gcc' directory that aren't built into the GCC executable but
rather are part of runtime libraries and object files, such as
`crtstuff.c' and `unwind-dw2.c'.  *Note Headers Installed by GCC:
Headers, for more information about the `ginclude' directory.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Headers,  Next: Documentation,  Prev: Library Files,  Up: gcc Directory

6.3.6 Headers Installed by GCC
------------------------------

In general, GCC expects the system C library to provide most of the
headers to be used with it.  However, GCC will fix those headers if
necessary to make them work with GCC, and will install some headers
required of freestanding implementations.  These headers are installed
in `LIBSUBDIR/include'.  Headers for non-C runtime libraries are also
installed by GCC; these are not documented here.  (FIXME: document them
somewhere.)

   Several of the headers GCC installs are in the `ginclude' directory.
These headers, `iso646.h', `stdarg.h', `stdbool.h', and `stddef.h',
are installed in `LIBSUBDIR/include', unless the target Makefile
fragment (*note Target Fragment::) overrides this by setting `USER_H'.

   In addition to these headers and those generated by fixing system
headers to work with GCC, some other headers may also be installed in
`LIBSUBDIR/include'.  `config.gcc' may set `extra_headers'; this
specifies additional headers under `config' to be installed on some
systems.

   GCC installs its own version of `<float.h>', from `ginclude/float.h'.
This is done to cope with command-line options that change the
representation of floating point numbers.

   GCC also installs its own version of `<limits.h>'; this is generated
from `glimits.h', together with `limitx.h' and `limity.h' if the system
also has its own version of `<limits.h>'.  (GCC provides its own header
because it is required of ISO C freestanding implementations, but needs
to include the system header from its own header as well because other
standards such as POSIX specify additional values to be defined in
`<limits.h>'.)  The system's `<limits.h>' header is used via
`LIBSUBDIR/include/syslimits.h', which is copied from `gsyslimits.h' if
it does not need fixing to work with GCC; if it needs fixing,
`syslimits.h' is the fixed copy.

6.3.7 Building Documentation

The main GCC documentation is in the form of manuals in Texinfo format.
These are installed in Info format, and DVI versions may be generated
by `make dvi'.  In addition, some man pages are generated from the
Texinfo manuals, there are some other text files with miscellaneous
documentation, and runtime libraries have their own documentation
outside the `gcc' directory.  FIXME: document the documentation for
runtime libraries somewhere.

`gpl.texi'
     The GNU General Public License.

`texinfo.tex'
     A copy of `texinfo.tex' known to work with the GCC manuals.

   DVI formatted manuals are generated by `make dvi', which uses
`texi2dvi' (via the Makefile macro `$(TEXI2DVI)').  Info manuals are
generated by `make info' (which is run as part of a bootstrap); this
generates the manuals in the source directory, using `makeinfo' via the
Makefile macro `$(MAKEINFO)', and they are included in release
distributions.

   Manuals are also provided on the GCC web site, in both HTML and
PostScript forms.  This is done via the script
`maintainer-scripts/update_web_docs'.  Each manual to be provided
online must be listed in the definition of `MANUALS' in that file; a
file `NAME.texi' must only appear once in the source tree, and the
output manual must have the same name as the source file.  (However,
other Texinfo files, included in manuals but not themselves the root
files of manuals, may have names that appear more than once in the
source tree.)  The manual file `NAME.texi' should only include other
files in its own directory or in `doc/include'.  HTML manuals will be
generated by `makeinfo --html' and PostScript manuals by `texi2dvi' and
`dvips'.  All Texinfo files that are parts of manuals must be checked
into CVS, even if they are generated files, for the generation of
online manuals to work.

   The installation manual, `doc/install.texi', is also provided on the
GCC web site.  The HTML version is generated by the script
`doc/install.texi2html'.

6.3.7.2 Man Page Generation
...........................

Because of user demand, in addition to full Texinfo manuals, man pages
are provided which contain extracts from those manuals.  These man
pages are generated from the Texinfo manuals using
`contrib/texi2pod.pl' and `pod2man'.  (The man page for `g++',
`cp/g++.1', just contains a `.so' reference to `gcc.1', but all the
other man pages are generated from Texinfo manuals.)

   Because many systems may not have the necessary tools installed to
generate the man pages, they are only generated if the `configure'
script detects that recent enough tools are installed, and the
Makefiles allow generating man pages to fail without aborting the
build.  Man pages are also included in release distributions.  They are
generated in the source directory.

   Magic comments in Texinfo files starting `@c man' control what parts
of a Texinfo file go into a man page.  Only a subset of Texinfo is
supported by `texi2pod.pl', and it may be necessary to add support for
more Texinfo features to this script when generating new man pages.  To
improve the man page output, some special Texinfo macros are provided
in `doc/include/gcc-common.texi' which `texi2pod.pl' understands:

`@gcctabopt'
     Use in the form `@table @gcctabopt' for tables of options, where
     for printed output the effect of `@code' is better than that of
     `@option' but for man page output a different effect is wanted.

`@gccoptlist'
     Use for summary lists of options in manuals.

`@gol'
     Use at the end of each line inside `@gccoptlist'.  This is
     necessary to avoid problems with differences in how the
     `@gccoptlist' macro is handled by different Texinfo formatters.

   FIXME: describe the `texi2pod.pl' input language and magic comments
in more detail.

In addition to the formal documentation that is installed by GCC, there
are several other text files with miscellaneous documentation:

`ABOUT-GCC-NLS'
     Notes on GCC's Native Language Support.  FIXME: this should be
     part of this manual rather than a separate file.

     the information in this file should be part of general
     documentation of the front-end interface in this manual.

`ONEWS'

6.3.8 Anatomy of a Language Front End
-------------------------------------

A front end for a language in GCC has the following parts:

   * A directory `LANGUAGE' under `gcc' containing source files for
     that front end.  *Note The Front End `LANGUAGE' Directory: Front
     End Directory, for details.

   * A mention of the language in the list of supported languages in
     `gcc/doc/install.texi'.

   * A mention of the name under which the language's runtime library is
     recognized by `--enable-shared=PACKAGE' in the documentation of
     that option in `gcc/doc/install.texi'.

   * A mention of any special prerequisites for building the front end
     in the documentation of prerequisites in `gcc/doc/install.texi'.

   * Details of contributors to that front end in
     `gcc/doc/contrib.texi'.  If the details are in that front end's
     own manual then there should be a link to that manual's list in
     `contrib.texi'.

   * Information about support for that language in
     `gcc/doc/frontends.texi'.

   * Information about standards for that language, and the front end's
     support for them, in `gcc/doc/standards.texi'.  This may be a link
     to such information in the front end's own manual.

   * Details of source file suffixes for that language and `-x LANG'
     options supported, in `gcc/doc/invoke.texi'.

   * Entries in `default_compilers' in `gcc.c' for source file suffixes
     for that language.

   * Preferably testsuites, which may be under `gcc/testsuite' or
     runtime library directories.  FIXME: document somewhere how to
     write testsuite harnesses.

   * Probably a runtime library for the language, outside the `gcc'
     directory.  FIXME: document this further.

   * Details of the directories of any runtime libraries in
     `gcc/doc/sourcebuild.texi'.

   If the front end is added to the official GCC CVS repository, the
following are also necessary:

   * At least one Bugzilla component for bugs in that front end and
     runtime libraries.  This category needs to be mentioned in
     `gcc/gccbug.in', as well as being added to the Bugzilla database.

   * Normally, one or more maintainers of that front end listed in
     `MAINTAINERS'.

   * Mentions on the GCC web site in `index.html' and `frontends.html',
     with any relevant links on `readings.html'.  (Front ends that are
     not an official part of GCC may also be listed on
     `frontends.html', with relevant links.)

   * A news item on `index.html', and possibly an announcement on the
     <gcc-announce@gcc.gnu.org> mailing list.

   * The front end's manuals should be mentioned in
     `maintainer-scripts/update_web_docs' (*note Texinfo Manuals::) and
     the online manuals should be linked to from
     `onlinedocs/index.html'.

   * Any old releases or CVS repositories of the front end, before its
     inclusion in GCC, should be made available on the GCC FTP site
     `ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/old-releases/'.

   * The release and snapshot script `maintainer-scripts/gcc_release'
     should be updated to generate appropriate tarballs for this front
     end.  The associated `maintainer-scripts/snapshot-README' and
     `maintainer-scripts/snapshot-index.html' files should be updated
     to list the tarballs and diffs for this front end.

   * If this front end includes its own version files that include the
     current date, `maintainer-scripts/update_version' should be
     updated accordingly.

   * `CVSROOT/modules' in the GCC CVS repository should be updated.

* Menu:

* Front End Directory::  The front end `LANGUAGE' directory.
* Front End Config::     The front end `config-lang.in' file.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Front End Directory,  Next: Front End Config,  Up: Front End

6.3.8.1 The Front End `LANGUAGE' Directory
..........................................

A front end `LANGUAGE' directory contains the source files of that
front end (but not of any runtime libraries, which should be outside
the `gcc' directory).  This includes documentation, and possibly some
subsidiary programs build alongside the front end.  Certain files are
special and other parts of the compiler depend on their names:

`config-lang.in'
     This file is required in all language subdirectories.  *Note The
     Front End `config-lang.in' File: Front End Config, for details of
     its contents

`Make-lang.in'
     This file is required in all language subdirectories.  It contains
     targets `LANG.HOOK' (where `LANG' is the setting of `language' in
     `config-lang.in') for the following values of `HOOK', and any
     other Makefile rules required to build those targets (which may if
     necessary use other Makefiles specified in `outputs' in
     `config-lang.in', although this is deprecated).  Some hooks are
     defined by using a double-colon rule for `HOOK', rather than by
     using a target of form `LANG.HOOK'.  These hooks are called
     "double-colon hooks" below.  It also adds any testsuite targets
     that can use the standard rule in `gcc/Makefile.in' to the variable
     `lang_checks'.

    `all.build'
    `all.cross'
    `start.encap'
    `rest.encap'
          FIXME: exactly what goes in each of these targets?

    `tags'
          Build an `etags' `TAGS' file in the language subdirectory in
          the source tree.

    `info'
          Build info documentation for the front end, in the build
          directory.  This target is only called by `make bootstrap' if
          a suitable version of `makeinfo' is available, so does not
          need to check for this, and should fail if an error occurs.

    `dvi'
          Build DVI documentation for the front end, in the build
          directory.  This should be done using `$(TEXI2DVI)', with
          appropriate `-I' arguments pointing to directories of
          included files.  This hook is a double-colon hook.

    `man'
          Build generated man pages for the front end from Texinfo
          manuals (*note Man Page Generation::), in the build
          directory.  This target is only called if the necessary tools
          are available, but should ignore errors so as not to stop the
          build if errors occur; man pages are optional and the tools
          involved may be installed in a broken way.

    `install-normal'
          FIXME: what is this target for?

    `install-common'
          Install everything that is part of the front end, apart from
          the compiler executables listed in `compilers' in
          `config-lang.in'.

    `install-info'
          Install info documentation for the front end, if it is
          present in the source directory.  This target should have
          dependencies on info files that should be installed.  This
          hook is a double-colon hook.

    `install-man'
          Install man pages for the front end.  This target should
          ignore errors.

    `srcextra'
          Copies its dependencies into the source directory.  This
          generally should be used for generated files such as
          `gcc/c-parse.c' which are not present in CVS, but should be
          included in any release tarballs.  This target will be
          executed during a bootstrap if
          `--enable-generated-files-in-srcdir' was specified as a
          `configure' option.

    `srcinfo'
    `srcman'
          Copies its dependencies into the source directory.  These
          targets will be executed during a bootstrap if
          `--enable-generated-files-in-srcdir' was specified as a
          `configure' option.

    `uninstall'
          Uninstall files installed by installing the compiler.  This is
          currently documented not to be supported, so the hook need
          not do anything.

    `mostlyclean'
    `clean'
    `distclean'
    `maintainer-clean'
          The language parts of the standard GNU `*clean' targets.
          *Note Standard Targets for Users: (standards)Standard
          Targets, for details of the standard targets.  For GCC,
          `maintainer-clean' should delete all generated files in the
          source directory that are not checked into CVS, but should
          not delete anything checked into CVS.

    `stage1'
    `stage2'
    `stage3'
    `stage4'
    `stageprofile'
    `stagefeedback'
          Move to the stage directory files not included in
          `stagestuff' in `config-lang.in' or otherwise moved by the
          main `Makefile'.

`lang.opt'
     This file registers the set of switches that the front end accepts
     on the command line, and their -help text.  The file format is
     documented in the file `c.opt'.  These files are processed by the
     script `opts.sh'.

`lang-specs.h'
     This file provides entries for `default_compilers' in `gcc.c'
     which override the default of giving an error that a compiler for
     that language is not installed.

`LANGUAGE-tree.def'
     This file, which need not exist, defines any language-specific tree
     codes.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Front End Config,  Prev: Front End Directory,  Up: Front End

6.3.8.2 The Front End `config-lang.in' File
...........................................

Each language subdirectory contains a `config-lang.in' file.  In
addition the main directory contains `c-config-lang.in', which contains
limited information for the C language.  This file is a shell script
that may define some variables describing the language:

`language'
     This definition must be present, and gives the name of the language
     for some purposes such as arguments to `--enable-languages'.

`lang_requires'
     If defined, this variable lists (space-separated) language front
     ends other than C that this front end requires to be enabled (with
     the names given being their `language' settings).  For example, the
     Java front end depends on the C++ front end, so sets
     `lang_requires=c++'.

`target_libs'
     If defined, this variable lists (space-separated) targets in the
     top level `Makefile' to build the runtime libraries for this
     language, such as `target-libobjc'.

`lang_dirs'
     If defined, this variable lists (space-separated) top level
     directories (parallel to `gcc'), apart from the runtime libraries,
     that should not be configured if this front end is not built.

`build_by_default'
     If defined to `no', this language front end is not built unless
     enabled in a `--enable-languages' argument.  Otherwise, front ends
     are built by default, subject to any special logic in
     `configure.ac' (as is present to disable the Ada front end if the
     Ada compiler is not already installed).

`boot_language'
     If defined to `yes', this front end is built in stage 1 of the
     bootstrap.  This is only relevant to front ends written in their
     own languages.

`compilers'
     If defined, a space-separated list of compiler executables that
     will be run by the driver.  The names here will each end with
     `\$(exeext)'.

`stagestuff'
     If defined, a space-separated list of files that should be moved to
     the `stageN' directories in each stage of bootstrap.

`outputs'
     If defined, a space-separated list of files that should be
     generated by `configure' substituting values in them.  This
     mechanism can be used to create a file `LANGUAGE/Makefile' from
     `LANGUAGE/Makefile.in', but this is deprecated, building
     everything from the single `gcc/Makefile' is preferred.

`gtfiles'
     If defined, a space-separated list of files that should be scanned
     by gengtype.c to generate the garbage collection tables and
     routines for this language.  This excludes the files that are
     common to all front ends. *Note Type Information::.

6.3.9 Anatomy of a Target Back End
----------------------------------

A back end for a target architecture in GCC has the following parts:

   * A directory `MACHINE' under `gcc/config', containing a machine
     description `MACHINE.md' file (*note Machine Descriptions: Machine
     Desc.), header files `MACHINE.h' and `MACHINE-protos.h' and a
     source file `MACHINE.c' (*note Target Description Macros and
     Functions: Target Macros.), possibly a target Makefile fragment
     `t-MACHINE' (*note The Target Makefile Fragment: Target
     Fragment.), and maybe some other files.  The names of these files
     may be changed from the defaults given by explicit specifications
     in `config.gcc'.

   * If necessary, a file `MACHINE-modes.def' in the `MACHINE'
     directory, containing additional machine modes to represent
     condition codes.  *Note Condition Code::, for further details.

   * Entries in `config.gcc' (*note The `config.gcc' File: System
     Config.) for the systems with this target architecture.

   * Documentation in `gcc/doc/invoke.texi' for any command-line
     options supported by this target (*note Run-time Target
     Specification: Run-time Target.).  This means both entries in the
     summary table of options and details of the individual options.

   * Documentation in `gcc/doc/extend.texi' for any target-specific
     attributes supported (*note Defining target-specific uses of
     `__attribute__': Target Attributes.), including where the same
     attribute is already supported on some targets, which are
     enumerated in the manual.

   * Documentation in `gcc/doc/extend.texi' for any target-specific
     pragmas supported.

   * Documentation in `gcc/doc/extend.texi' of any target-specific
     built-in functions supported.

   * Documentation in `gcc/doc/md.texi' of any target-specific
     constraint letters (*note Constraints for Particular Machines:
     Machine Constraints.).

   * A note in `gcc/doc/contrib.texi' under the person or people who
     contributed the target support.

   * Entries in `gcc/doc/install.texi' for all target triplets
     supported with this target architecture, giving details of any
     special notes about installation for this target, or saying that
     there are no special notes if there are none.

   * Possibly other support outside the `gcc' directory for runtime
     libraries.  FIXME: reference docs for this.  The libstdc++ porting
     manual needs to be installed as info for this to work, or to be a
     chapter of this manual.

   If the back end is added to the official GCC CVS repository, the
following are also necessary:

   * An entry for the target architecture in `readings.html' on the GCC
     web site, with any relevant links.

   * Details of the properties of the back end and target architecture
     in `backends.html' on the GCC web site.

   * A news item about the contribution of support for that target
     architecture, in `index.html' on the GCC web site.

   * Normally, one or more maintainers of that target listed in
     `MAINTAINERS'.  Some existing architectures may be unmaintained,
     but it would be unusual to add support for a target that does not
     have a maintainer when support is added.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Testsuites,  Prev: gcc Directory,  Up: Source Tree

6.4 Testsuites
==============

GCC contains several testsuites to help maintain compiler quality.
Most of the runtime libraries and language front ends in GCC have
testsuites.  Currently only the C language testsuites are documented
here; FIXME: document the others.

* Menu:

* Test Idioms::     Idioms used in testsuite code.
* Ada Tests::       The Ada language testsuites.
* C Tests::         The C language testsuites.
* libgcj Tests::    The Java library testsuites.
* gcov Testing::    Support for testing gcov.
* profopt Testing:: Support for testing profile-directed optimizations.
* compat Testing::  Support for testing binary compatibility.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Test Idioms,  Next: Ada Tests,  Up: Testsuites

6.4.1 Idioms Used in Testsuite Code
-----------------------------------

In general C testcases have a trailing `-N.c', starting with `-1.c', in
case other testcases with similar names are added later.  If the test
is a test of some well-defined feature, it should have a name referring
to that feature such as `FEATURE-1.c'.  If it does not test a
well-defined feature but just happens to exercise a bug somewhere in
the compiler, and a bug report has been filed for this bug in the GCC
bug database, `prBUG-NUMBER-1.c' is the appropriate form of name.
Otherwise (for miscellaneous bugs not filed in the GCC bug database),
and previously more generally, test cases are named after the date on
which they were added.  This allows people to tell at a glance whether
a test failure is because of a recently found bug that has not yet been
fixed, or whether it may be a regression, but does not give any other
information about the bug or where discussion of it may be found.  Some
other language testsuites follow similar conventions.

   Test cases should use `abort ()' to indicate failure and `exit (0)'
for success; on some targets these may be redefined to indicate failure
and success in other ways.

   In the `gcc.dg' testsuite, it is often necessary to test that an
error is indeed a hard error and not just a warning--for example, where
it is a constraint violation in the C standard, which must become an
error with `-pedantic-errors'.  The following idiom, where the first
line shown is line LINE of the file and the line that generates the
error, is used for this:

     /* { dg-bogus "warning" "warning in place of error" } */
     /* { dg-error "REGEXP" "MESSAGE" { target *-*-* } LINE } */

   It may be necessary to check that an expression is an integer
constant expression and has a certain value.  To check that `E' has
value `V', an idiom similar to the following is used:

     char x[((E) == (V) ? 1 : -1)];

   In `gcc.dg' tests, `__typeof__' is sometimes used to make assertions
about the types of expressions.  See, for example,
`gcc.dg/c99-condexpr-1.c'.  The more subtle uses depend on the exact
rules for the types of conditional expressions in the C standard; see,
for example, `gcc.dg/c99-intconst-1.c'.

   It is useful to be able to test that optimizations are being made
properly.  This cannot be done in all cases, but it can be done where
the optimization will lead to code being optimized away (for example,
where flow analysis or alias analysis should show that certain code
cannot be called) or to functions not being called because they have
been expanded as built-in functions.  Such tests go in
`gcc.c-torture/execute'.  Where code should be optimized away, a call
to a nonexistent function such as `link_failure ()' may be inserted; a
definition

     #ifndef __OPTIMIZE__
     void
     link_failure (void)
     {
       abort ();
     }
     #endif

will also be needed so that linking still succeeds when the test is run
without optimization.  When all calls to a built-in function should
have been optimized and no calls to the non-built-in version of the
function should remain, that function may be defined as `static' to
call `abort ()' (although redeclaring a function as static may not work
on all targets).

   All testcases must be portable.  Target-specific testcases must have
appropriate code to avoid causing failures on unsupported systems;
unfortunately, the mechanisms for this differ by directory.

   FIXME: discuss non-C testsuites here.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Ada Tests,  Next: C Tests,  Prev: Test Idioms,  Up: Testsuites

6.4.2 Ada Language Testsuites
-----------------------------

The Ada testsuite includes executable tests from the ACATS 2.5
testsuite, publicly available at
`http://www.adaic.org/compilers/acats/2.5'

   These tests are integrated in the GCC testsuite in the
`gcc/testsuite/ada/acats' directory, and enabled automatically when
running `make check', assuming the Ada language has been enabled when
configuring GCC.

   You can also run the Ada testsuite independently, using `make
check-ada', or run a subset of the tests by specifying which chapter to
run, e.g:

     $ make check-ada CHAPTERS="c3 c9"

   The tests are organized by directory, each directory corresponding to
a chapter of the Ada Reference Manual. So for example, c9 corresponds
to chapter 9, which deals with tasking features of the language.

   There is also an extra chapter called `gcc' containing a template for
creating new executable tests.

   The tests are run using two 'sh' scripts: run_acats and run_all.sh
To run the tests using a simulator or a cross target, see the small
customization section at the top of run_all.sh

   These tests are run using the build tree: they can be run without
doing a `make install'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: C Tests,  Next: libgcj Tests,  Prev: Ada Tests,  Up: Testsuites

6.4.3 C Language Testsuites
---------------------------

GCC contains the following C language testsuites, in the
`gcc/testsuite' directory:

`gcc.dg'
     This contains tests of particular features of the C compiler,
     using the more modern `dg' harness.  Correctness tests for various
     compiler features should go here if possible.

     Magic comments determine whether the file is preprocessed,
     compiled, linked or run.  In these tests, error and warning
     message texts are compared against expected texts or regular
     expressions given in comments.  These tests are run with the
     options `-ansi -pedantic' unless other options are given in the
     test.  Except as noted below they are not run with multiple
     optimization options.

`gcc.dg/compat'
     This subdirectory contains tests for binary compatibility using
     `compat.exp', which in turn uses the language-independent support
     (*note Support for testing binary compatibility: compat Testing.).

`gcc.dg/cpp'
     This subdirectory contains tests of the preprocessor.

`gcc.dg/debug'
     This subdirectory contains tests for debug formats.  Tests in this
     subdirectory are run for each debug format that the compiler
     supports.

`gcc.dg/format'
     This subdirectory contains tests of the `-Wformat' format
     checking.  Tests in this directory are run with and without
     `-DWIDE'.

`gcc.dg/noncompile'
     This subdirectory contains tests of code that should not compile
     and does not need any special compilation options.  They are run
     with multiple optimization options, since sometimes invalid code
     crashes the compiler with optimization.

`gcc.dg/special'
     FIXME: describe this.

`gcc.c-torture'
     This contains particular code fragments which have historically
     broken easily.  These tests are run with multiple optimization
     options, so tests for features which only break at some
     optimization levels belong here.  This also contains tests to
     check that certain optimizations occur.  It might be worthwhile to
     separate the correctness tests cleanly from the code quality
     tests, but it hasn't been done yet.

`gcc.c-torture/compat'
     FIXME: describe this.

     This directory should probably not be used for new tests.

`gcc.c-torture/compile'
     This testsuite contains test cases that should compile, but do not
     need to link or run.  These test cases are compiled with several
     different combinations of optimization options.  All warnings are
     disabled for these test cases, so this directory is not suitable if
     you wish to test for the presence or absence of compiler warnings.
     While special options can be set, and tests disabled on specific
     platforms, by the use of `.x' files, mostly these test cases
     should not contain platform dependencies.  FIXME: discuss how
     defines such as `NO_LABEL_VALUES' and `STACK_SIZE' are used.

`gcc.c-torture/execute'
     This testsuite contains test cases that should compile, link and
     run; otherwise the same comments as for `gcc.c-torture/compile'
     apply.

`gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee'
     This contains tests which are specific to IEEE floating point.

`gcc.c-torture/unsorted'
     FIXME: describe this.

     This directory should probably not be used for new tests.

`gcc.c-torture/misc-tests'
     This directory contains C tests that require special handling.
     Some of these tests have individual expect files, and others share
     special-purpose expect files:

    ``bprob*.c''
          Test `-fbranch-probabilities' using `bprob.exp', which in
          turn uses the generic, language-independent framework (*note
          Support for testing profile-directed optimizations: profopt
          Testing.).

    ``dg-*.c''
          Test the testsuite itself using `dg-test.exp'.

    ``gcov*.c''
          Test `gcov' output using `gcov.exp', which in turn uses the
          language-independent support (*note Support for testing gcov:
          gcov Testing.).

    ``i386-pf-*.c''
          Test i386-specific support for data prefetch using
          `i386-prefetch.exp'.


   FIXME: merge in `testsuite/README.gcc' and discuss the format of
test cases and magic comments more.

6.4.4 The Java library testsuites.
----------------------------------

Runtime tests are executed via `make check' in the
`TARGET/libjava/testsuite' directory in the build tree.  Additional
runtime tests can be checked into this testsuite.

   Regression testing of the core packages in libgcj is also covered by
the Mauve testsuite.  The Mauve Project develops tests for the Java
Class Libraries.  These tests are run as part of libgcj testing by
placing the Mauve tree within the libjava testsuite sources at
`libjava/testsuite/libjava.mauve/mauve', or by specifying the location
of that tree when invoking `make', as in `make MAUVEDIR=~/mauve check'.

   To detect regressions, a mechanism in `mauve.exp' compares the
failures for a test run against the list of expected failures in
`libjava/testsuite/libjava.mauve/xfails' from the source hierarchy.
Update this file when adding new failing tests to Mauve, or when fixing
bugs in libgcj that had caused Mauve test failures.

   The Jacks project provides a testsuite for Java compilers that can
be used to test changes that affect the GCJ front end.  This testsuite
is run as part of Java testing by placing the Jacks tree within the the
libjava testsuite sources at `libjava/testsuite/libjava.jacks/jacks'.

   We encourage developers to contribute test cases to Mauve and Jacks.

6.4.5 Support for testing `gcov'
--------------------------------

Language-independent support for testing `gcov', and for checking that
branch profiling produces expected values, is provided by the expect
file `gcov.exp'.  `gcov' tests also rely on procedures in `gcc.dg.exp'
to compile and run the test program.  A typical `gcov' test contains
the following DejaGNU commands within comments:

     { dg-options "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" }
     { dg-do run { target native } }
     { dg-final { run-gcov sourcefile } }

   Checks of `gcov' output can include line counts, branch percentages,
and call return percentages.  All of these checks are requested via
commands that appear in comments in the test's source file.  Commands
to check line counts are processed by default.  Commands to check
branch percentages and call return percentages are processed if the
`run-gcov' command has arguments `branches' or `calls', respectively.
For example, the following specifies checking both, as well as passing
`-b' to `gcov':

     { dg-final { run-gcov branches calls { -b sourcefile } } }

   A line count command appears within a comment on the source line
that is expected to get the specified count and has the form
`count(CNT)'.  A test should only check line counts for lines that will
get the same count for any architecture.

   Commands to check branch percentages (`branch') and call return
percentages (`returns') are very similar to each other.  A beginning
command appears on or before the first of a range of lines that will
report the percentage, and the ending command follows that range of
lines.  The beginning command can include a list of percentages, all of
which are expected to be found within the range.  A range is terminated
by the next command of the same kind.  A command `branch(end)' or
`returns(end)' marks the end of a range without starting a new one.
For example:

     if (i > 10 && j > i && j < 20)  /* branch(27 50 75) */
                                     /* branch(end) */
       foo (i, j);

   For a call return percentage, the value specified is the percentage
of calls reported to return.  For a branch percentage, the value is
either the expected percentage or 100 minus that value, since the
direction of a branch can differ depending on the target or the
optimization level.

   Not all branches and calls need to be checked.  A test should not
check for branches that might be optimized away or replaced with
predicated instructions.  Don't check for calls inserted by the
compiler or ones that might be inlined or optimized away.

   A single test can check for combinations of line counts, branch
percentages, and call return percentages.  The command to check a line
count must appear on the line that will report that count, but commands
to check branch percentages and call return percentages can bracket the
lines that report them.

6.4.6 Support for testing profile-directed optimizations
--------------------------------------------------------

The file `profopt.exp' provides language-independent support for
checking correct execution of a test built with profile-directed
optimization.  This testing requires that a test program be built and
executed twice.  The first time it is compiled to generate profile
data, and the second time it is compiled to use the data that was
generated during the first execution.  The second execution is to
verify that the test produces the expected results.

   To check that the optimization actually generated better code, a
test can be built and run a third time with normal optimizations to
verify that the performance is better with the profile-directed
optimizations.  `profopt.exp' has the beginnings of this kind of
support.

   `profopt.exp' provides generic support for profile-directed
optimizations.  Each set of tests that uses it provides information
about a specific optimization:

`tool'
     tool being tested, e.g., `gcc'

`profile_option'
     options used to generate profile data

`feedback_option'
     options used to optimize using that profile data

`prof_ext'
     suffix of profile data files

`PROFOPT_OPTIONS'
     list of options with which to run each test, similar to the lists
     for torture tests


File: gccint.info,  Node: compat Testing,  Prev: profopt Testing,  Up: Testsuites

6.4.7 Support for testing binary compatibility
----------------------------------------------

The file `compat.exp' provides language-independent support for binary
compatibility testing.  It supports testing interoperability of two
compilers that follow the same ABI, or of multiple sets of compiler
options that should not affect binary compatibility.  It is intended to
be used for testsuites that complement ABI testsuites.

   A test supported by this framework has three parts, each in a
separate source file: a main program and two pieces that interact with
each other to split up the functionality being tested.

`TESTNAME_main.SUFFIX'
     Contains the main program, which calls a function in file
     `TESTNAME_x.SUFFIX'.

`TESTNAME_x.SUFFIX'
     Contains at least one call to a function in `TESTNAME_y.SUFFIX'.

`TESTNAME_y.SUFFIX'
     Shares data with, or gets arguments from, `TESTNAME_x.SUFFIX'.

   Within each test, the main program and one functional piece are
compiled by the GCC under test.  The other piece can be compiled by an
alternate compiler.  If no alternate compiler is specified, then all
three source files are all compiled by the GCC under test.  It's also
possible to specify a pair of lists of compiler options, one list for
each compiler, so that each test will be compiled with each pair of
options.

   `compat.exp' defines default pairs of compiler options.  These can
be overridden by defining the environment variable `COMPAT_OPTIONS' as:

     COMPAT_OPTIONS="[list [list {TST1} {ALT1}]
       ...[list {TSTN} {ALTN}]]"

   where TSTI and ALTI are lists of options, with TSTI used by the
compiler under test and ALTI used by the alternate compiler.  For
example, with `[list [list {-g -O0} {-O3}] [list {-fpic} {-fPIC -O2}]]',
the test is first built with `-g -O0' by the compiler under test and
with `-O3' by the alternate compiler.  The test is built a second time
using `-fpic' by the compiler under test and `-fPIC -O2' by the
alternate compiler.

   An alternate compiler is specified by defining an environment
variable; for C++ define `ALT_CXX_UNDER_TEST' to be the full pathname
of an installed compiler.  That will be written to the `site.exp' file
used by DejaGNU.  The default is to build each test with the compiler
under test using the first of each pair of compiler options from
`COMPAT_OPTIONS'.  When `ALT_CXX_UNDER_TEST' is `same', each test is
built using the compiler under test but with combinations of the
options from `COMPAT_OPTIONS'.

   To run only the C++ compatibility suite using the compiler under test
and another version of GCC using specific compiler options, do the
following from `OBJDIR/gcc':

     rm site.exp
     make -k \
       ALT_CXX_UNDER_TEST=${alt_prefix}/bin/g++ \
       COMPAT_OPTIONS="lists as shown above" \
       check-c++ \
       RUNTESTFLAGS="compat.exp"

   A test that fails when the source files are compiled with different
compilers, but passes when the files are compiled with the same
compiler, demonstrates incompatibility of the generated code or runtime
support.  A test that fails for the alternate compiler but passes for
the compiler under test probably tests for a bug that was fixed in the
compiler under test but is present in the alternate compiler.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Passes,  Next: Trees,  Prev: Source Tree,  Up: Top

7 Passes and Files of the Compiler
**********************************

The overall control structure of the compiler is in `toplev.c'.  This
file is responsible for initialization, decoding arguments, opening and
closing files, and sequencing the passes.  Routines for emitting
diagnostic messages are defined in `diagnostic.c'.  The files
`pretty-print.h' and `pretty-print.c' provide basic support for
language-independent pretty-printing.

   The parsing pass is invoked only once, to parse the entire input.  A
high level tree representation is then generated from the input, one
function at a time.  This tree code is then transformed into RTL
intermediate code, and processed.  The files involved in transforming
the trees into RTL are `expr.c', `expmed.c', and `stmt.c'.  The order
of trees that are processed, is not necessarily the same order they are
generated from the input, due to deferred inlining, and other
considerations.

   Each time the parsing pass reads a complete function definition or
top-level declaration, it calls either the function
`rest_of_compilation', or the function `rest_of_decl_compilation' in
`toplev.c', which are responsible for all further processing necessary,
ending with output of the assembler language.  All other compiler
passes run, in sequence, within `rest_of_compilation'.  When that
function returns from compiling a function definition, the storage used
for that function definition's compilation is entirely freed, unless it
is an inline function, or was deferred for some reason (this can occur
in templates, for example).  (*note An Inline Function is As Fast As a
Macro: (gcc)Inline.).

   Here is a list of all the passes of the compiler and their source
files.  Also included is a description of where debugging dumps can be
requested with `-d' options.

   * Parsing.  This pass reads the entire text of a function definition,
     constructing a high level tree representation.  (Because of the
     semantic analysis that takes place during this pass, it does more
     than is formally considered to be parsing.)

     The tree representation does not entirely follow C syntax, because
     it is intended to support other languages as well.

     Language-specific data type analysis is also done in this pass,
     and every tree node that represents an expression has a data type
     attached.  Variables are represented as declaration nodes.

     The language-independent source files for parsing are `tree.c',
     `fold-const.c', and `stor-layout.c'.  There are also header files
     `tree.h' and `tree.def' which define the format of the tree
     representation.

     C preprocessing, for language front ends, that want or require it,
     is performed by cpplib, which is covered in separate
     documentation.  In particular, the internals are covered in *Note
     Cpplib internals: (cppinternals)Top.

     The source files to parse C are found in the toplevel directory,
     and by convention are named `c-*'.  Some of these are also used by
     the other C-like languages: `c-common.c', `c-common.def',
     `c-format.c', `c-opts.c', `c-pragma.c', `c-semantics.c', `c-lex.c',
     `c-incpath.c', `c-ppoutput.c', `c-cppbuiltin.c', `c-common.h',
     `c-dump.h', `c.opt', `c-incpath.h' and `c-pragma.h',

     Files specific to each language are in subdirectories named after
     the language in question, like `ada', `objc', `cp' (for C++).

   * Tree optimization.   This is the optimization of the tree
     representation, before converting into RTL code.

     Currently, the main optimization performed here is tree-based
     inlining.  This is implemented in `tree-inline.c' and used by both
     C and C++.  Note that tree based inlining turns off rtx based
     inlining (since it's more powerful, it would be a waste of time to
     do rtx based inlining in addition).

     Constant folding and some arithmetic simplifications are also done
     during this pass, on the tree representation.  The routines that
     perform these tasks are located in `fold-const.c'.

   * RTL generation.  This is the conversion of syntax tree into RTL
     code.

     This is where the bulk of target-parameter-dependent code is found,
     since often it is necessary for strategies to apply only when
     certain standard kinds of instructions are available.  The purpose
     of named instruction patterns is to provide this information to
     the RTL generation pass.

     Optimization is done in this pass for `if'-conditions that are
     comparisons, boolean operations or conditional expressions.  Tail
     recursion is detected at this time also.  Decisions are made about
     how best to arrange loops and how to output `switch' statements.

     The source files for RTL generation include `stmt.c', `calls.c',
     `expr.c', `explow.c', `expmed.c', `function.c', `optabs.c' and
     `emit-rtl.c'.  Also, the file `insn-emit.c', generated from the
     machine description by the program `genemit', is used in this
     pass.  The header file `expr.h' is used for communication within
     this pass.

     The header files `insn-flags.h' and `insn-codes.h', generated from
     the machine description by the programs `genflags' and `gencodes',
     tell this pass which standard names are available for use and
     which patterns correspond to them.

     Aside from debugging information output, none of the following
     passes refers to the tree structure representation of the function
     (only part of which is saved).

     The decision of whether the function can and should be expanded
     inline in its subsequent callers is made at the end of rtl
     generation.  The function must meet certain criteria, currently
     related to the size of the function and the types and number of
     parameters it has.  Note that this function may contain loops,
     recursive calls to itself (tail-recursive functions can be
     inlined!), gotos, in short, all constructs supported by GCC.  The
     file `integrate.c' contains the code to save a function's rtl for
     later inlining and to inline that rtl when the function is called.
     The header file `integrate.h' is also used for this purpose.

     The option `-dr' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.rtl' to
     the input file name.

   * Sibling call optimization.   This pass performs tail recursion
     elimination, and tail and sibling call optimizations.  The purpose
     of these optimizations is to reduce the overhead of function calls,
     whenever possible.

     The source file of this pass is `sibcall.c'

     The option `-di' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass is run.  This dump file's name is made by appending
     `.sibling' to the input file name.

   * Jump optimization.  This pass simplifies jumps to the following
     instruction, jumps across jumps, and jumps to jumps.  It deletes
     unreferenced labels and unreachable code, except that unreachable
     code that contains a loop is not recognized as unreachable in this
     pass.  (Such loops are deleted later in the basic block analysis.)
     It also converts some code originally written with jumps into
     sequences of instructions that directly set values from the
     results of comparisons, if the machine has such instructions.

     Jump optimization is performed two or three times.  The first time
     is immediately following RTL generation.  The second time is after
     CSE, but only if CSE says repeated jump optimization is needed.
     The last time is right before the final pass.  That time,
     cross-jumping and deletion of no-op move instructions are done
     together with the optimizations described above.

     The source file of this pass is `jump.c'.

     The option `-dj' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass is run for the first time.  This dump file's name is
     made by appending `.jump' to the input file name.

   * Register scan.  This pass finds the first and last use of each
     register, as a guide for common subexpression elimination.  Its
     source is in `regclass.c'.

   * Jump threading.  This pass detects a condition jump that branches
     to an identical or inverse test.  Such jumps can be `threaded'
     through the second conditional test.  The source code for this
     pass is in `jump.c'.  This optimization is only performed if
     `-fthread-jumps' is enabled.

   * Common subexpression elimination.  This pass also does constant
     propagation.  Its source files are `cse.c', and `cselib.c'.  If
     constant  propagation causes conditional jumps to become
     unconditional or to become no-ops, jump optimization is run again
     when CSE is finished.

     The option `-ds' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.cse' to
     the input file name.

   * Global common subexpression elimination.  This pass performs two
     different types of GCSE  depending on whether you are optimizing
     for size or not (LCM based GCSE tends to increase code size for a
     gain in speed, while Morel-Renvoise based GCSE does not).  When
     optimizing for size, GCSE is done using Morel-Renvoise Partial
     Redundancy Elimination, with the exception that it does not try to
     move invariants out of loops--that is left to  the loop
     optimization pass.  If MR PRE GCSE is done, code hoisting (aka
     unification) is also done, as well as load motion.  If you are
     optimizing for speed, LCM (lazy code motion) based GCSE is done.
     LCM is based on the work of Knoop, Ruthing, and Steffen.  LCM
     based GCSE also does loop invariant code motion.  We also perform
     load and store motion when optimizing for speed.  Regardless of
     which type of GCSE is used, the GCSE pass also performs global
     constant and  copy propagation.

     The source file for this pass is `gcse.c', and the LCM routines
     are in `lcm.c'.

     The option `-dG' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.gcse' to
     the input file name.

   * Loop optimization.  This pass moves constant expressions out of
     loops, and optionally does strength-reduction and loop unrolling
     as well.  Its source files are `loop.c' and `unroll.c', plus the
     header `loop.h' used for communication between them.  Loop
     unrolling uses some functions in `integrate.c' and the header
     `integrate.h'.  Loop dependency analysis routines are contained in
     `dependence.c'.

     Second loop optimization pass takes care of basic block level
     optimizations - unrolling, peeling and unswitching loops. The
     source files are `cfgloopanal.c' and `cfgloopmanip.c' containing
     generic loop analysis and manipulation code, `loop-init.c' with
     initialization and finalization code, `loop-unswitch.c' for loop
     unswitching and `loop-unroll.c' for loop unrolling and peeling.

     The option `-dL' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     these passes.  The dump file names are made by appending `.loop'
     and `.loop2' to the input file name.

   * Jump bypassing.  This pass is an aggressive form of GCSE that
     transforms the control flow graph of a function by propagating
     constants into conditional branch instructions.

     The source file for this pass is `gcse.c'.

     The option `-dG' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.bypass'
     to the input file name.

   * Simple optimization pass that splits independent uses of each
     pseudo increasing effect of other optimizations.  This can improve
     effect of the other transformation, such as CSE or register
     allocation.  Its source files are `web.c'.

     The option `-dZ' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.web' to
     the input file name.

   * If `-frerun-cse-after-loop' was enabled, a second common
     subexpression elimination pass is performed after the loop
     optimization pass.  Jump threading is also done again at this time
     if it was specified.

     The option `-dt' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.cse2' to
     the input file name.

   * Data flow analysis (`flow.c').  This pass divides the program into
     basic blocks (and in the process deletes unreachable loops); then
     it computes which pseudo-registers are live at each point in the
     program, and makes the first instruction that uses a value point at
     the instruction that computed the value.

     This pass also deletes computations whose results are never used,
     and combines memory references with add or subtract instructions
     to make autoincrement or autodecrement addressing.

     The option `-df' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.flow' to
     the input file name.  If stupid register allocation is in use, this
     dump file reflects the full results of such allocation.

   * Instruction combination (`combine.c').  This pass attempts to
     combine groups of two or three instructions that are related by
     data flow into single instructions.  It combines the RTL
     expressions for the instructions by substitution, simplifies the
     result using algebra, and then attempts to match the result
     against the machine description.

     The option `-dc' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.combine'
     to the input file name.

   * If-conversion is a transformation that transforms control
     dependencies into data dependencies (IE it transforms conditional
     code into a single control stream).  It is implemented in the file
     `ifcvt.c'.

     The option `-dE' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.ce' to
     the input file name.

   * Register movement (`regmove.c').  This pass looks for cases where
     matching constraints would force an instruction to need a reload,
     and this reload would be a register-to-register move.  It then
     attempts to change the registers used by the instruction to avoid
     the move instruction.

     The option `-dN' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.regmove'
     to the input file name.

   * Instruction scheduling (`sched.c').  This pass looks for
     instructions whose output will not be available by the time that
     it is used in subsequent instructions.  (Memory loads and floating
     point instructions often have this behavior on RISC machines).  It
     re-orders instructions within a basic block to try to separate the
     definition and use of items that otherwise would cause pipeline
     stalls.

     Instruction scheduling is performed twice.  The first time is
     immediately after instruction combination and the second is
     immediately after reload.

     The option `-dS' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass is run for the first time.  The dump file's name is made by
     appending `.sched' to the input file name.

   * Register allocation.  These passes make sure that all occurrences
     of pseudo registers are eliminated, either by allocating them to a
     hard register, replacing them by an equivalent expression (e.g. a
     constant) or by placing them on the stack.  This is done in
     several subpasses:

        * Register class preferencing.  The RTL code is scanned to find
          out which register class is best for each pseudo register.
          The source file is `regclass.c'.

        * Local register allocation (`local-alloc.c').  This pass
          allocates hard registers to pseudo registers that are used
          only within one basic block.  Because the basic block is
          linear, it can use fast and powerful techniques to do a very
          good job.

          The option `-dl' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
          this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending
          `.lreg' to the input file name.

        * Global register allocation (`global.c').  This pass allocates
          hard registers for the remaining pseudo registers (those
          whose life spans are not contained in one basic block).

        * Graph coloring register allocator.  The files `ra.c',
          `ra-build.c', `ra-colorize.c', `ra-debug.c', `ra-rewrite.c'
          together with the header `ra.h' contain another register
          allocator, which is used when the option `-fnew-ra' is given.
          In that case it is run instead of the above mentioned local
          and global register allocation passes, and the option `-dl'
          causes a debugging dump of its work.

        * Reloading.  This pass renumbers pseudo registers with the
          hardware registers numbers they were allocated.  Pseudo
          registers that did not get hard registers are replaced with
          stack slots.  Then it finds instructions that are invalid
          because a value has failed to end up in a register, or has
          ended up in a register of the wrong kind.  It fixes up these
          instructions by reloading the problematical values
          temporarily into registers.  Additional instructions are
          generated to do the copying.

          The reload pass also optionally eliminates the frame pointer
          and inserts instructions to save and restore call-clobbered
          registers around calls.

          Source files are `reload.c' and `reload1.c', plus the header
          `reload.h' used for communication between them.

          The option `-dg' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
          this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending
          `.greg' to the input file name.

   * Instruction scheduling is repeated here to try to avoid pipeline
     stalls due to memory loads generated for spilled pseudo registers.

     The option `-dR' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.sched2'
     to the input file name.

   * Basic block reordering.  This pass implements profile guided code
     positioning.  If profile information is not available, various
     types of static analysis are performed to make the predictions
     normally coming from the profile feedback (IE execution frequency,
     branch probability, etc).  It is implemented in the file
     `bb-reorder.c', and the various prediction routines are in
     `predict.c'.

     The option `-dB' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.bbro' to
     the input file name.

   * Delayed branch scheduling.  This optional pass attempts to find
     instructions that can go into the delay slots of other
     instructions, usually jumps and calls.  The source file name is
     `reorg.c'.

     The option `-dd' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.dbr' to
     the input file name.

   * Branch shortening.  On many RISC machines, branch instructions
     have a limited range.  Thus, longer sequences of instructions must
     be used for long branches.  In this pass, the compiler figures out
     what how far each instruction will be from each other instruction,
     and therefore whether the usual instructions, or the longer
     sequences, must be used for each branch.

   * Conversion from usage of some hard registers to usage of a register
     stack may be done at this point.  Currently, this is supported only
     for the floating-point registers of the Intel 80387 coprocessor.
     The source file name is `reg-stack.c'.

     The options `-dk' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.stack' to
     the input file name.

   * Final.  This pass outputs the assembler code for the function.  It
     is also responsible for identifying spurious test and compare
     instructions.  Machine-specific peephole optimizations are
     performed at the same time.  The function entry and exit sequences
     are generated directly as assembler code in this pass; they never
     exist as RTL.

     The source files are `final.c' plus `insn-output.c'; the latter is
     generated automatically from the machine description by the tool
     `genoutput'.  The header file `conditions.h' is used for
     communication between these files.

   * Debugging information output.  This is run after final because it
     must output the stack slot offsets for pseudo registers that did
     not get hard registers.  Source files are `dbxout.c' for DBX
     symbol table format, `sdbout.c' for SDB symbol table format,
     `dwarfout.c' for DWARF symbol table format, files `dwarf2out.c' and
     `dwarf2asm.c' for DWARF2 symbol table format, and `vmsdbgout.c'
     for VMS debug symbol table format.

   Some additional files are used by all or many passes:

   * Every pass uses `machmode.def' and `machmode.h' which define the
     machine modes.

   * Several passes use `real.h', which defines the default
     representation of floating point constants and how to operate on
     them.

   * All the passes that work with RTL use the header files `rtl.h' and
     `rtl.def', and subroutines in file `rtl.c'.  The tools `gen*' also
     use these files to read and work with the machine description RTL.

   * All the tools that read the machine description use support
     routines found in `gensupport.c', `errors.c', and `read-rtl.c'.

   * Several passes refer to the header file `insn-config.h' which
     contains a few parameters (C macro definitions) generated
     automatically from the machine description RTL by the tool
     `genconfig'.

   * Several passes use the instruction recognizer, which consists of
     `recog.c' and `recog.h', plus the files `insn-recog.c' and
     `insn-extract.c' that are generated automatically from the machine
     description by the tools `genrecog' and `genextract'.

   * Several passes use the header files `regs.h' which defines the
     information recorded about pseudo register usage, and
     `basic-block.h' which defines the information recorded about basic
     blocks.

   * `hard-reg-set.h' defines the type `HARD_REG_SET', a bit-vector
     with a bit for each hard register, and some macros to manipulate
     it.  This type is just `int' if the machine has few enough hard
     registers; otherwise it is an array of `int' and some of the
     macros expand into loops.

   * Several passes use instruction attributes.  A definition of the
     attributes defined for a particular machine is in file
     `insn-attr.h', which is generated from the machine description by
     the program `genattr'.  The file `insn-attrtab.c' contains
     subroutines to obtain the attribute values for insns and
     information about processor pipeline characteristics for the
     instruction scheduler.  It is generated from the machine
     description by the program `genattrtab'.

8 Trees: The intermediate representation used by the C and C++ front ends
*************************************************************************

This chapter documents the internal representation used by GCC to
represent C and C++ source programs.  When presented with a C or C++
source program, GCC parses the program, performs semantic analysis
(including the generation of error messages), and then produces the
internal representation described here.  This representation contains a
complete representation for the entire translation unit provided as
input to the front end.  This representation is then typically processed
by a code-generator in order to produce machine code, but could also be
used in the creation of source browsers, intelligent editors, automatic
documentation generators, interpreters, and any other programs needing
the ability to process C or C++ code.

   This chapter explains the internal representation.  In particular, it
documents the internal representation for C and C++ source constructs,
and the macros, functions, and variables that can be used to access
these constructs.  The C++ representation is largely a superset of the
representation used in the C front end.  There is only one construct
used in C that does not appear in the C++ front end and that is the GNU
"nested function" extension.  Many of the macros documented here do not
apply in C because the corresponding language constructs do not appear
in C.

   If you are developing a "back end", be it is a code-generator or some
other tool, that uses this representation, you may occasionally find
that you need to ask questions not easily answered by the functions and
macros available here.  If that situation occurs, it is quite likely
that GCC already supports the functionality you desire, but that the
interface is simply not documented here.  In that case, you should ask
the GCC maintainers (via mail to <gcc@gcc.gnu.org>) about documenting
the functionality you require.  Similarly, if you find yourself writing
functions that do not deal directly with your back end, but instead
might be useful to other people using the GCC front end, you should
submit your patches for inclusion in GCC.

8.1 Deficiencies
================

There are many places in which this document is incomplet and incorrekt.
It is, as of yet, only _preliminary_ documentation.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Tree overview,  Next: Types,  Prev: Deficiencies,  Up: Trees

8.2 Overview
============

The central data structure used by the internal representation is the
`tree'.  These nodes, while all of the C type `tree', are of many
varieties.  A `tree' is a pointer type, but the object to which it
points may be of a variety of types.  From this point forward, we will
refer to trees in ordinary type, rather than in `this font', except
when talking about the actual C type `tree'.

   You can tell what kind of node a particular tree is by using the
`TREE_CODE' macro.  Many, many macros take trees as input and return
trees as output.  However, most macros require a certain kind of tree
node as input.  In other words, there is a type-system for trees, but
it is not reflected in the C type-system.

   For safety, it is useful to configure GCC with `--enable-checking'.
Although this results in a significant performance penalty (since all
tree types are checked at run-time), and is therefore inappropriate in a
release version, it is extremely helpful during the development process.

   Many macros behave as predicates.  Many, although not all, of these
predicates end in `_P'.  Do not rely on the result type of these macros
being of any particular type.  You may, however, rely on the fact that
the type can be compared to `0', so that statements like
     if (TEST_P (t) && !TEST_P (y))
       x = 1;
   and
     int i = (TEST_P (t) != 0);
   are legal.  Macros that return `int' values now may be changed to
return `tree' values, or other pointers in the future.  Even those that
continue to return `int' may return multiple nonzero codes where
previously they returned only zero and one.  Therefore, you should not
write code like
     if (TEST_P (t) == 1)
   as this code is not guaranteed to work correctly in the future.

   You should not take the address of values returned by the macros or
functions described here.  In particular, no guarantee is given that the
values are lvalues.

   In general, the names of macros are all in uppercase, while the
names of functions are entirely in lowercase.  There are rare
exceptions to this rule.  You should assume that any macro or function
whose name is made up entirely of uppercase letters may evaluate its
arguments more than once.  You may assume that a macro or function
whose name is made up entirely of lowercase letters will evaluate its
arguments only once.

   The `error_mark_node' is a special tree.  Its tree code is
`ERROR_MARK', but since there is only ever one node with that code, the
usual practice is to compare the tree against `error_mark_node'.  (This
test is just a test for pointer equality.)  If an error has occurred
during front-end processing the flag `errorcount' will be set.  If the
front end has encountered code it cannot handle, it will issue a
message to the user and set `sorrycount'.  When these flags are set,
any macro or function which normally returns a tree of a particular
kind may instead return the `error_mark_node'.  Thus, if you intend to
do any processing of erroneous code, you must be prepared to deal with
the `error_mark_node'.

   Occasionally, a particular tree slot (like an operand to an
expression, or a particular field in a declaration) will be referred to
as "reserved for the back end."  These slots are used to store RTL when
the tree is converted to RTL for use by the GCC back end.  However, if
that process is not taking place (e.g., if the front end is being hooked
up to an intelligent editor), then those slots may be used by the back
end presently in use.

   If you encounter situations that do not match this documentation,
such as tree nodes of types not mentioned here, or macros documented to
return entities of a particular kind that instead return entities of
some different kind, you have found a bug, either in the front end or in
the documentation.  Please report these bugs as you would any other bug.

8.2.1 Trees

This section is not here yet.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Identifiers,  Next: Containers,  Prev: Macros and Functions,  Up: Tree overview

8.2.2 Identifiers
-----------------

An `IDENTIFIER_NODE' represents a slightly more general concept that
the standard C or C++ concept of identifier.  In particular, an
`IDENTIFIER_NODE' may contain a `$', or other extraordinary characters.

   There are never two distinct `IDENTIFIER_NODE's representing the
same identifier.  Therefore, you may use pointer equality to compare
`IDENTIFIER_NODE's, rather than using a routine like `strcmp'.

   You can use the following macros to access identifiers:
`IDENTIFIER_POINTER'
     The string represented by the identifier, represented as a
     `char*'.  This string is always `NUL'-terminated, and contains no
     embedded `NUL' characters.

`IDENTIFIER_LENGTH'
     The length of the string returned by `IDENTIFIER_POINTER', not
     including the trailing `NUL'.  This value of `IDENTIFIER_LENGTH
     (x)' is always the same as `strlen (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (x))'.

`IDENTIFIER_OPNAME_P'
     This predicate holds if the identifier represents the name of an
     overloaded operator.  In this case, you should not depend on the
     contents of either the `IDENTIFIER_POINTER' or the
     `IDENTIFIER_LENGTH'.

`IDENTIFIER_TYPENAME_P'
     This predicate holds if the identifier represents the name of a
     user-defined conversion operator.  In this case, the `TREE_TYPE' of
     the `IDENTIFIER_NODE' holds the type to which the conversion
     operator converts.



File: gccint.info,  Node: Containers,  Prev: Identifiers,  Up: Tree overview

8.2.3 Containers
----------------

Two common container data structures can be represented directly with
tree nodes.  A `TREE_LIST' is a singly linked list containing two trees
per node.  These are the `TREE_PURPOSE' and `TREE_VALUE' of each node.
(Often, the `TREE_PURPOSE' contains some kind of tag, or additional
information, while the `TREE_VALUE' contains the majority of the
payload.  In other cases, the `TREE_PURPOSE' is simply `NULL_TREE',
while in still others both the `TREE_PURPOSE' and `TREE_VALUE' are of
equal stature.)  Given one `TREE_LIST' node, the next node is found by
following the `TREE_CHAIN'.  If the `TREE_CHAIN' is `NULL_TREE', then
you have reached the end of the list.

   A `TREE_VEC' is a simple vector.  The `TREE_VEC_LENGTH' is an
integer (not a tree) giving the number of nodes in the vector.  The
nodes themselves are accessed using the `TREE_VEC_ELT' macro, which
takes two arguments.  The first is the `TREE_VEC' in question; the
second is an integer indicating which element in the vector is desired.
The elements are indexed from zero.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Types,  Next: Scopes,  Prev: Tree overview,  Up: Trees

8.3 Types
=========

All types have corresponding tree nodes.  However, you should not assume
that there is exactly one tree node corresponding to each type.  There
are often several nodes each of which correspond to the same type.

   For the most part, different kinds of types have different tree
codes.  (For example, pointer types use a `POINTER_TYPE' code while
arrays use an `ARRAY_TYPE' code.)  However, pointers to member functions
use the `RECORD_TYPE' code.  Therefore, when writing a `switch'
statement that depends on the code associated with a particular type,
you should take care to handle pointers to member functions under the
`RECORD_TYPE' case label.

   In C++, an array type is not qualified; rather the type of the array
elements is qualified.  This situation is reflected in the intermediate
representation.  The macros described here will always examine the
qualification of the underlying element type when applied to an array
type.  (If the element type is itself an array, then the recursion
continues until a non-array type is found, and the qualification of this
type is examined.)  So, for example, `CP_TYPE_CONST_P' will hold of the
type `const int ()[7]', denoting an array of seven `int's.

   The following functions and macros deal with cv-qualification of
types:
`CP_TYPE_QUALS'
     This macro returns the set of type qualifiers applied to this type.
     This value is `TYPE_UNQUALIFIED' if no qualifiers have been
     applied.  The `TYPE_QUAL_CONST' bit is set if the type is
     `const'-qualified.  The `TYPE_QUAL_VOLATILE' bit is set if the
     type is `volatile'-qualified.  The `TYPE_QUAL_RESTRICT' bit is set
     if the type is `restrict'-qualified.

`CP_TYPE_CONST_P'
     This macro holds if the type is `const'-qualified.

`CP_TYPE_VOLATILE_P'
     This macro holds if the type is `volatile'-qualified.

`CP_TYPE_RESTRICT_P'
     This macro holds if the type is `restrict'-qualified.

`CP_TYPE_CONST_NON_VOLATILE_P'
     This predicate holds for a type that is `const'-qualified, but
     _not_ `volatile'-qualified; other cv-qualifiers are ignored as
     well: only the `const'-ness is tested.

`TYPE_MAIN_VARIANT'
     This macro returns the unqualified version of a type.  It may be
     applied to an unqualified type, but it is not always the identity
     function in that case.

   A few other macros and functions are usable with all types:
`TYPE_SIZE'
     The number of bits required to represent the type, represented as
     an `INTEGER_CST'.  For an incomplete type, `TYPE_SIZE' will be
     `NULL_TREE'.

`TYPE_ALIGN'
     The alignment of the type, in bits, represented as an `int'.

`TYPE_NAME'
     This macro returns a declaration (in the form of a `TYPE_DECL') for
     the type.  (Note this macro does _not_ return a `IDENTIFIER_NODE',
     as you might expect, given its name!)  You can look at the
     `DECL_NAME' of the `TYPE_DECL' to obtain the actual name of the
     type.  The `TYPE_NAME' will be `NULL_TREE' for a type that is not
     a built-in type, the result of a typedef, or a named class type.

`CP_INTEGRAL_TYPE'
     This predicate holds if the type is an integral type.  Notice that
     in C++, enumerations are _not_ integral types.

`ARITHMETIC_TYPE_P'
     This predicate holds if the type is an integral type (in the C++
     sense) or a floating point type.

`CLASS_TYPE_P'
     This predicate holds for a class-type.

`TYPE_BUILT_IN'
     This predicate holds for a built-in type.

`TYPE_PTRMEM_P'
     This predicate holds if the type is a pointer to data member.

`TYPE_PTR_P'
     This predicate holds if the type is a pointer type, and the
     pointee is not a data member.

`TYPE_PTRFN_P'
     This predicate holds for a pointer to function type.

`TYPE_PTROB_P'
     This predicate holds for a pointer to object type.  Note however
     that it does not hold for the generic pointer to object type `void
     *'.  You may use `TYPE_PTROBV_P' to test for a pointer to object
     type as well as `void *'.

`same_type_p'
     This predicate takes two types as input, and holds if they are the
     same type.  For example, if one type is a `typedef' for the other,
     or both are `typedef's for the same type.  This predicate also
     holds if the two trees given as input are simply copies of one
     another; i.e., there is no difference between them at the source
     level, but, for whatever reason, a duplicate has been made in the
     representation.  You should never use `==' (pointer equality) to
     compare types; always use `same_type_p' instead.

   Detailed below are the various kinds of types, and the macros that
can be used to access them.  Although other kinds of types are used
elsewhere in G++, the types described here are the only ones that you
will encounter while examining the intermediate representation.

`VOID_TYPE'
     Used to represent the `void' type.

`INTEGER_TYPE'
     Used to represent the various integral types, including `char',
     `short', `int', `long', and `long long'.  This code is not used
     for enumeration types, nor for the `bool' type.  Note that GCC's
     `CHAR_TYPE' node is _not_ used to represent `char'.  The
     `TYPE_PRECISION' is the number of bits used in the representation,
     represented as an `unsigned int'.  (Note that in the general case
     this is not the same value as `TYPE_SIZE'; suppose that there were
     a 24-bit integer type, but that alignment requirements for the ABI
     required 32-bit alignment.  Then, `TYPE_SIZE' would be an
     `INTEGER_CST' for 32, while `TYPE_PRECISION' would be 24.)  The
     integer type is unsigned if `TREE_UNSIGNED' holds; otherwise, it
     is signed.

     The `TYPE_MIN_VALUE' is an `INTEGER_CST' for the smallest integer
     that may be represented by this type.  Similarly, the
     `TYPE_MAX_VALUE' is an `INTEGER_CST' for the largest integer that
     may be represented by this type.

`REAL_TYPE'
     Used to represent the `float', `double', and `long double' types.
     The number of bits in the floating-point representation is given
     by `TYPE_PRECISION', as in the `INTEGER_TYPE' case.

`COMPLEX_TYPE'
     Used to represent GCC built-in `__complex__' data types.  The
     `TREE_TYPE' is the type of the real and imaginary parts.

`ENUMERAL_TYPE'
     Used to represent an enumeration type.  The `TYPE_PRECISION' gives
     (as an `int'), the number of bits used to represent the type.  If
     there are no negative enumeration constants, `TREE_UNSIGNED' will
     hold.  The minimum and maximum enumeration constants may be
     obtained with `TYPE_MIN_VALUE' and `TYPE_MAX_VALUE', respectively;
     each of these macros returns an `INTEGER_CST'.

     The actual enumeration constants themselves may be obtained by
     looking at the `TYPE_VALUES'.  This macro will return a
     `TREE_LIST', containing the constants.  The `TREE_PURPOSE' of each
     node will be an `IDENTIFIER_NODE' giving the name of the constant;
     the `TREE_VALUE' will be an `INTEGER_CST' giving the value
     assigned to that constant.  These constants will appear in the
     order in which they were declared.  The `TREE_TYPE' of each of
     these constants will be the type of enumeration type itself.

`BOOLEAN_TYPE'
     Used to represent the `bool' type.

`POINTER_TYPE'
     Used to represent pointer types, and pointer to data member types.
     The `TREE_TYPE' gives the type to which this type points.  If the
     type is a pointer to data member type, then `TYPE_PTRMEM_P' will
     hold.  For a pointer to data member type of the form `T X::*',
     `TYPE_PTRMEM_CLASS_TYPE' will be the type `X', while
     `TYPE_PTRMEM_POINTED_TO_TYPE' will be the type `T'.

`REFERENCE_TYPE'
     Used to represent reference types.  The `TREE_TYPE' gives the type
     to which this type refers.

`FUNCTION_TYPE'
     Used to represent the type of non-member functions and of static
     member functions.  The `TREE_TYPE' gives the return type of the
     function.  The `TYPE_ARG_TYPES' are a `TREE_LIST' of the argument
     types.  The `TREE_VALUE' of each node in this list is the type of
     the corresponding argument; the `TREE_PURPOSE' is an expression
     for the default argument value, if any.  If the last node in the
     list is `void_list_node' (a `TREE_LIST' node whose `TREE_VALUE' is
     the `void_type_node'), then functions of this type do not take
     variable arguments.  Otherwise, they do take a variable number of
     arguments.

     Note that in C (but not in C++) a function declared like `void f()'
     is an unprototyped function taking a variable number of arguments;
     the `TYPE_ARG_TYPES' of such a function will be `NULL'.

`METHOD_TYPE'
     Used to represent the type of a non-static member function.  Like a
     `FUNCTION_TYPE', the return type is given by the `TREE_TYPE'.  The
     type of `*this', i.e., the class of which functions of this type
     are a member, is given by the `TYPE_METHOD_BASETYPE'.  The
     `TYPE_ARG_TYPES' is the parameter list, as for a `FUNCTION_TYPE',
     and includes the `this' argument.

`ARRAY_TYPE'
     Used to represent array types.  The `TREE_TYPE' gives the type of
     the elements in the array.  If the array-bound is present in the
     type, the `TYPE_DOMAIN' is an `INTEGER_TYPE' whose
     `TYPE_MIN_VALUE' and `TYPE_MAX_VALUE' will be the lower and upper
     bounds of the array, respectively.  The `TYPE_MIN_VALUE' will
     always be an `INTEGER_CST' for zero, while the `TYPE_MAX_VALUE'
     will be one less than the number of elements in the array, i.e.,
     the highest value which may be used to index an element in the
     array.

`RECORD_TYPE'
     Used to represent `struct' and `class' types, as well as pointers
     to member functions and similar constructs in other languages.
     `TYPE_FIELDS' contains the items contained in this type, each of
     which can be a `FIELD_DECL', `VAR_DECL', `CONST_DECL', or
     `TYPE_DECL'.  You may not make any assumptions about the ordering
     of the fields in the type or whether one or more of them overlap.
     If `TYPE_PTRMEMFUNC_P' holds, then this type is a pointer-to-member
     type.  In that case, the `TYPE_PTRMEMFUNC_FN_TYPE' is a
     `POINTER_TYPE' pointing to a `METHOD_TYPE'.  The `METHOD_TYPE' is
     the type of a function pointed to by the pointer-to-member
     function.  If `TYPE_PTRMEMFUNC_P' does not hold, this type is a
     class type.  For more information, see *note Classes::.

`UNION_TYPE'
     Used to represent `union' types.  Similar to `RECORD_TYPE' except
     that all `FIELD_DECL' nodes in `TYPE_FIELD' start at bit position
     zero.

`QUAL_UNION_TYPE'
     Used to represent part of a variant record in Ada.  Similar to
     `UNION_TYPE' except that each `FIELD_DECL' has a `DECL_QUALIFIER'
     field, which contains a boolean expression that indicates whether
     the field is present in the object.  The type will only have one
     field, so each field's `DECL_QUALIFIER' is only evaluated if none
     of the expressions in the previous fields in `TYPE_FIELDS' are
     nonzero.  Normally these expressions will reference a field in the
     outer object using a `PLACEHOLDER_EXPR'.

`UNKNOWN_TYPE'
     This node is used to represent a type the knowledge of which is
     insufficient for a sound processing.

`OFFSET_TYPE'
     This node is used to represent a pointer-to-data member.  For a
     data member `X::m' the `TYPE_OFFSET_BASETYPE' is `X' and the
     `TREE_TYPE' is the type of `m'.

`TYPENAME_TYPE'
     Used to represent a construct of the form `typename T::A'.  The
     `TYPE_CONTEXT' is `T'; the `TYPE_NAME' is an `IDENTIFIER_NODE' for
     `A'.  If the type is specified via a template-id, then
     `TYPENAME_TYPE_FULLNAME' yields a `TEMPLATE_ID_EXPR'.  The
     `TREE_TYPE' is non-`NULL' if the node is implicitly generated in
     support for the implicit typename extension; in which case the
     `TREE_TYPE' is a type node for the base-class.

`TYPEOF_TYPE'
     Used to represent the `__typeof__' extension.  The `TYPE_FIELDS'
     is the expression the type of which is being represented.

   There are variables whose values represent some of the basic types.
These include:
`void_type_node'
     A node for `void'.

`integer_type_node'
     A node for `int'.

`unsigned_type_node.'
     A node for `unsigned int'.

`char_type_node.'
     A node for `char'.
   It may sometimes be useful to compare one of these variables with a
type in hand, using `same_type_p'.

8.4 Scopes
==========

The root of the entire intermediate representation is the variable
`global_namespace'.  This is the namespace specified with `::' in C++
source code.  All other namespaces, types, variables, functions, and so
forth can be found starting with this namespace.

   Besides namespaces, the other high-level scoping construct in C++ is
the class.  (Throughout this manual the term "class" is used to mean the
types referred to in the ANSI/ISO C++ Standard as classes; these include
types defined with the `class', `struct', and `union' keywords.)

* Menu:

* Namespaces::          Member functions, types, etc.
* Classes::             Members, bases, friends, etc.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Namespaces,  Next: Classes,  Up: Scopes

8.4.1 Namespaces
----------------

A namespace is represented by a `NAMESPACE_DECL' node.

   However, except for the fact that it is distinguished as the root of
the representation, the global namespace is no different from any other
namespace.  Thus, in what follows, we describe namespaces generally,
rather than the global namespace in particular.

   The following macros and functions can be used on a `NAMESPACE_DECL':

`DECL_NAME'
     This macro is used to obtain the `IDENTIFIER_NODE' corresponding to
     the unqualified name of the name of the namespace (*note
     Identifiers::).  The name of the global namespace is `::', even
     though in C++ the global namespace is unnamed.  However, you
     should use comparison with `global_namespace', rather than
     `DECL_NAME' to determine whether or not a namespace is the global
     one.  An unnamed namespace will have a `DECL_NAME' equal to
     `anonymous_namespace_name'.  Within a single translation unit, all
     unnamed namespaces will have the same name.

`DECL_CONTEXT'
     This macro returns the enclosing namespace.  The `DECL_CONTEXT' for
     the `global_namespace' is `NULL_TREE'.

`DECL_NAMESPACE_ALIAS'
     If this declaration is for a namespace alias, then
     `DECL_NAMESPACE_ALIAS' is the namespace for which this one is an
     alias.

     Do not attempt to use `cp_namespace_decls' for a namespace which is
     an alias.  Instead, follow `DECL_NAMESPACE_ALIAS' links until you
     reach an ordinary, non-alias, namespace, and call
     `cp_namespace_decls' there.

`DECL_NAMESPACE_STD_P'
     This predicate holds if the namespace is the special `::std'
     namespace.

`cp_namespace_decls'
     This function will return the declarations contained in the
     namespace, including types, overloaded functions, other
     namespaces, and so forth.  If there are no declarations, this
     function will return `NULL_TREE'.  The declarations are connected
     through their `TREE_CHAIN' fields.

     Although most entries on this list will be declarations,
     `TREE_LIST' nodes may also appear.  In this case, the `TREE_VALUE'
     will be an `OVERLOAD'.  The value of the `TREE_PURPOSE' is
     unspecified; back ends should ignore this value.  As with the
     other kinds of declarations returned by `cp_namespace_decls', the
     `TREE_CHAIN' will point to the next declaration in this list.

     For more information on the kinds of declarations that can occur
     on this list, *Note Declarations::.  Some declarations will not
     appear on this list.  In particular, no `FIELD_DECL',
     `LABEL_DECL', or `PARM_DECL' nodes will appear here.

     This function cannot be used with namespaces that have
     `DECL_NAMESPACE_ALIAS' set.



File: gccint.info,  Node: Classes,  Prev: Namespaces,  Up: Scopes

8.4.2 Classes
-------------

A class type is represented by either a `RECORD_TYPE' or a
`UNION_TYPE'.  A class declared with the `union' tag is represented by
a `UNION_TYPE', while classes declared with either the `struct' or the
`class' tag are represented by `RECORD_TYPE's.  You can use the
`CLASSTYPE_DECLARED_CLASS' macro to discern whether or not a particular
type is a `class' as opposed to a `struct'.  This macro will be true
only for classes declared with the `class' tag.

   Almost all non-function members are available on the `TYPE_FIELDS'
list.  Given one member, the next can be found by following the
`TREE_CHAIN'.  You should not depend in any way on the order in which
fields appear on this list.  All nodes on this list will be `DECL'
nodes.  A `FIELD_DECL' is used to represent a non-static data member, a
`VAR_DECL' is used to represent a static data member, and a `TYPE_DECL'
is used to represent a type.  Note that the `CONST_DECL' for an
enumeration constant will appear on this list, if the enumeration type
was declared in the class.  (Of course, the `TYPE_DECL' for the
enumeration type will appear here as well.)  There are no entries for
base classes on this list.  In particular, there is no `FIELD_DECL' for
the "base-class portion" of an object.

   The `TYPE_VFIELD' is a compiler-generated field used to point to
virtual function tables.  It may or may not appear on the `TYPE_FIELDS'
list.  However, back ends should handle the `TYPE_VFIELD' just like all
the entries on the `TYPE_FIELDS' list.

   The function members are available on the `TYPE_METHODS' list.
Again, subsequent members are found by following the `TREE_CHAIN'
field.  If a function is overloaded, each of the overloaded functions
appears; no `OVERLOAD' nodes appear on the `TYPE_METHODS' list.
Implicitly declared functions (including default constructors, copy
constructors, assignment operators, and destructors) will appear on
this list as well.

   Every class has an associated "binfo", which can be obtained with
`TYPE_BINFO'.  Binfos are used to represent base-classes.  The binfo
given by `TYPE_BINFO' is the degenerate case, whereby every class is
considered to be its own base-class.  The base classes for a particular
binfo can be obtained with `BINFO_BASETYPES'.  These base-classes are
themselves binfos.  The class type associated with a binfo is given by
`BINFO_TYPE'.  It is always the case that `BINFO_TYPE (TYPE_BINFO (x))'
is the same type as `x', up to qualifiers.  However, it is not always
the case that `TYPE_BINFO (BINFO_TYPE (y))' is always the same binfo as
`y'.  The reason is that if `y' is a binfo representing a base-class
`B' of a derived class `D', then `BINFO_TYPE (y)' will be `B', and
`TYPE_BINFO (BINFO_TYPE (y))' will be `B' as its own base-class, rather
than as a base-class of `D'.

   The `BINFO_BASETYPES' is a `TREE_VEC' (*note Containers::).  Base
types appear in left-to-right order in this vector.  You can tell
whether or `public', `protected', or `private' inheritance was used by
using the `TREE_VIA_PUBLIC', `TREE_VIA_PROTECTED', and
`TREE_VIA_PRIVATE' macros.  Each of these macros takes a `BINFO' and is
true if and only if the indicated kind of inheritance was used.  If
`TREE_VIA_VIRTUAL' holds of a binfo, then its `BINFO_TYPE' was
inherited from virtually.

   The following macros can be used on a tree node representing a
class-type.

`LOCAL_CLASS_P'
     This predicate holds if the class is local class _i.e._ declared
     inside a function body.

`TYPE_POLYMORPHIC_P'
     This predicate holds if the class has at least one virtual function
     (declared or inherited).

`TYPE_HAS_DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTOR'
     This predicate holds whenever its argument represents a class-type
     with default constructor.

`CLASSTYPE_HAS_MUTABLE'
`TYPE_HAS_MUTABLE_P'
     These predicates hold for a class-type having a mutable data
     member.

`CLASSTYPE_NON_POD_P'
     This predicate holds only for class-types that are not PODs.

`TYPE_HAS_NEW_OPERATOR'
     This predicate holds for a class-type that defines `operator new'.

`TYPE_HAS_ARRAY_NEW_OPERATOR'
     This predicate holds for a class-type for which `operator new[]'
     is defined.

`TYPE_OVERLOADS_CALL_EXPR'
     This predicate holds for class-type for which the function call
     `operator()' is overloaded.

`TYPE_OVERLOADS_ARRAY_REF'
     This predicate holds for a class-type that overloads `operator[]'

`TYPE_OVERLOADS_ARROW'
     This predicate holds for a class-type for which `operator->' is
     overloaded.

8.5 Declarations
================

This section covers the various kinds of declarations that appear in the
internal representation, except for declarations of functions
(represented by `FUNCTION_DECL' nodes), which are described in *Note
Functions::.

   Some macros can be used with any kind of declaration.  These include:
`DECL_NAME'
     This macro returns an `IDENTIFIER_NODE' giving the name of the
     entity.

`TREE_TYPE'
     This macro returns the type of the entity declared.

`DECL_SOURCE_FILE'
     This macro returns the name of the file in which the entity was
     declared, as a `char*'.  For an entity declared implicitly by the
     compiler (like `__builtin_memcpy'), this will be the string
     `"<internal>"'.

`DECL_SOURCE_LINE'
     This macro returns the line number at which the entity was
     declared, as an `int'.

`DECL_ARTIFICIAL'
     This predicate holds if the declaration was implicitly generated
     by the compiler.  For example, this predicate will hold of an
     implicitly declared member function, or of the `TYPE_DECL'
     implicitly generated for a class type.  Recall that in C++ code
     like:
          struct S {};
     is roughly equivalent to C code like:
          struct S {};
          typedef struct S S;
     The implicitly generated `typedef' declaration is represented by a
     `TYPE_DECL' for which `DECL_ARTIFICIAL' holds.

`DECL_NAMESPACE_SCOPE_P'
     This predicate holds if the entity was declared at a namespace
     scope.

`DECL_CLASS_SCOPE_P'
     This predicate holds if the entity was declared at a class scope.

`DECL_FUNCTION_SCOPE_P'
     This predicate holds if the entity was declared inside a function
     body.


   The various kinds of declarations include:
`LABEL_DECL'
     These nodes are used to represent labels in function bodies.  For
     more information, see *Note Functions::.  These nodes only appear
     in block scopes.

`CONST_DECL'
     These nodes are used to represent enumeration constants.  The
     value of the constant is given by `DECL_INITIAL' which will be an
     `INTEGER_CST' with the same type as the `TREE_TYPE' of the
     `CONST_DECL', i.e., an `ENUMERAL_TYPE'.

`RESULT_DECL'
     These nodes represent the value returned by a function.  When a
     value is assigned to a `RESULT_DECL', that indicates that the
     value should be returned, via bitwise copy, by the function.  You
     can use `DECL_SIZE' and `DECL_ALIGN' on a `RESULT_DECL', just as
     with a `VAR_DECL'.

`TYPE_DECL'
     These nodes represent `typedef' declarations.  The `TREE_TYPE' is
     the type declared to have the name given by `DECL_NAME'.  In some
     cases, there is no associated name.

`VAR_DECL'
     These nodes represent variables with namespace or block scope, as
     well as static data members.  The `DECL_SIZE' and `DECL_ALIGN' are
     analogous to `TYPE_SIZE' and `TYPE_ALIGN'.  For a declaration, you
     should always use the `DECL_SIZE' and `DECL_ALIGN' rather than the
     `TYPE_SIZE' and `TYPE_ALIGN' given by the `TREE_TYPE', since
     special attributes may have been applied to the variable to give
     it a particular size and alignment.  You may use the predicates
     `DECL_THIS_STATIC' or `DECL_THIS_EXTERN' to test whether the
     storage class specifiers `static' or `extern' were used to declare
     a variable.

     If this variable is initialized (but does not require a
     constructor), the `DECL_INITIAL' will be an expression for the
     initializer.  The initializer should be evaluated, and a bitwise
     copy into the variable performed.  If the `DECL_INITIAL' is the
     `error_mark_node', there is an initializer, but it is given by an
     explicit statement later in the code; no bitwise copy is required.

     GCC provides an extension that allows either automatic variables,
     or global variables, to be placed in particular registers.  This
     extension is being used for a particular `VAR_DECL' if
     `DECL_REGISTER' holds for the `VAR_DECL', and if
     `DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' is not equal to `DECL_NAME'.  In that case,
     `DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' is the name of the register into which the
     variable will be placed.

`PARM_DECL'
     Used to represent a parameter to a function.  Treat these nodes
     similarly to `VAR_DECL' nodes.  These nodes only appear in the
     `DECL_ARGUMENTS' for a `FUNCTION_DECL'.

     The `DECL_ARG_TYPE' for a `PARM_DECL' is the type that will
     actually be used when a value is passed to this function.  It may
     be a wider type than the `TREE_TYPE' of the parameter; for
     example, the ordinary type might be `short' while the
     `DECL_ARG_TYPE' is `int'.

`FIELD_DECL'
     These nodes represent non-static data members.  The `DECL_SIZE' and
     `DECL_ALIGN' behave as for `VAR_DECL' nodes.  The
     `DECL_FIELD_BITPOS' gives the first bit used for this field, as an
     `INTEGER_CST'.  These values are indexed from zero, where zero
     indicates the first bit in the object.

     If `DECL_C_BIT_FIELD' holds, this field is a bit-field.

`NAMESPACE_DECL'
     *Note Namespaces::.

`TEMPLATE_DECL'
     These nodes are used to represent class, function, and variable
     (static data member) templates.  The
     `DECL_TEMPLATE_SPECIALIZATIONS' are a `TREE_LIST'.  The
     `TREE_VALUE' of each node in the list is a `TEMPLATE_DECL's or
     `FUNCTION_DECL's representing specializations (including
     instantiations) of this template.  Back ends can safely ignore
     `TEMPLATE_DECL's, but should examine `FUNCTION_DECL' nodes on the
     specializations list just as they would ordinary `FUNCTION_DECL'
     nodes.

     For a class template, the `DECL_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATIONS' list
     contains the instantiations.  The `TREE_VALUE' of each node is an
     instantiation of the class.  The `DECL_TEMPLATE_SPECIALIZATIONS'
     contains partial specializations of the class.

`USING_DECL'
     Back ends can safely ignore these nodes.

8.6 Functions
=============

A function is represented by a `FUNCTION_DECL' node.  A set of
overloaded functions is sometimes represented by a `OVERLOAD' node.

   An `OVERLOAD' node is not a declaration, so none of the `DECL_'
macros should be used on an `OVERLOAD'.  An `OVERLOAD' node is similar
to a `TREE_LIST'.  Use `OVL_CURRENT' to get the function associated
with an `OVERLOAD' node; use `OVL_NEXT' to get the next `OVERLOAD' node
in the list of overloaded functions.  The macros `OVL_CURRENT' and
`OVL_NEXT' are actually polymorphic; you can use them to work with
`FUNCTION_DECL' nodes as well as with overloads.  In the case of a
`FUNCTION_DECL', `OVL_CURRENT' will always return the function itself,
and `OVL_NEXT' will always be `NULL_TREE'.

   To determine the scope of a function, you can use the `DECL_CONTEXT'
macro.  This macro will return the class (either a `RECORD_TYPE' or a
`UNION_TYPE') or namespace (a `NAMESPACE_DECL') of which the function
is a member.  For a virtual function, this macro returns the class in
which the function was actually defined, not the base class in which
the virtual declaration occurred.

   If a friend function is defined in a class scope, the
`DECL_FRIEND_CONTEXT' macro can be used to determine the class in which
it was defined.  For example, in
     class C { friend void f() {} };
   the `DECL_CONTEXT' for `f' will be the `global_namespace', but the
`DECL_FRIEND_CONTEXT' will be the `RECORD_TYPE' for `C'.

   In C, the `DECL_CONTEXT' for a function maybe another function.
This representation indicates that the GNU nested function extension is
in use.  For details on the semantics of nested functions, see the GCC
Manual.  The nested function can refer to local variables in its
containing function.  Such references are not explicitly marked in the
tree structure; back ends must look at the `DECL_CONTEXT' for the
referenced `VAR_DECL'.  If the `DECL_CONTEXT' for the referenced
`VAR_DECL' is not the same as the function currently being processed,
and neither `DECL_EXTERNAL' nor `DECL_STATIC' hold, then the reference
is to a local variable in a containing function, and the back end must
take appropriate action.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Function Basics,  Next: Function Bodies,  Up: Functions

8.6.1 Function Basics
---------------------

The following macros and functions can be used on a `FUNCTION_DECL':
`DECL_MAIN_P'
     This predicate holds for a function that is the program entry point
     `::code'.

`DECL_NAME'
     This macro returns the unqualified name of the function, as an
     `IDENTIFIER_NODE'.  For an instantiation of a function template,
     the `DECL_NAME' is the unqualified name of the template, not
     something like `f<int>'.  The value of `DECL_NAME' is undefined
     when used on a constructor, destructor, overloaded operator, or
     type-conversion operator, or any function that is implicitly
     generated by the compiler.  See below for macros that can be used
     to distinguish these cases.

`DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME'
     This macro returns the mangled name of the function, also an
     `IDENTIFIER_NODE'.  This name does not contain leading underscores
     on systems that prefix all identifiers with underscores.  The
     mangled name is computed in the same way on all platforms; if
     special processing is required to deal with the object file format
     used on a particular platform, it is the responsibility of the
     back end to perform those modifications.  (Of course, the back end
     should not modify `DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' itself.)

`DECL_EXTERNAL'
     This predicate holds if the function is undefined.

`TREE_PUBLIC'
     This predicate holds if the function has external linkage.

`DECL_LOCAL_FUNCTION_P'
     This predicate holds if the function was declared at block scope,
     even though it has a global scope.

`DECL_ANTICIPATED'
     This predicate holds if the function is a built-in function but its
     prototype is not yet explicitly declared.

`DECL_EXTERN_C_FUNCTION_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is declared as an ``extern
     "C"'' function.

`DECL_LINKONCE_P'
     This macro holds if multiple copies of this function may be
     emitted in various translation units.  It is the responsibility of
     the linker to merge the various copies.  Template instantiations
     are the most common example of functions for which
     `DECL_LINKONCE_P' holds; G++ instantiates needed templates in all
     translation units which require them, and then relies on the
     linker to remove duplicate instantiations.

     FIXME: This macro is not yet implemented.

`DECL_FUNCTION_MEMBER_P'
     This macro holds if the function is a member of a class, rather
     than a member of a namespace.

`DECL_STATIC_FUNCTION_P'
     This predicate holds if the function a static member function.

`DECL_NONSTATIC_MEMBER_FUNCTION_P'
     This macro holds for a non-static member function.

`DECL_CONST_MEMFUNC_P'
     This predicate holds for a `const'-member function.

`DECL_VOLATILE_MEMFUNC_P'
     This predicate holds for a `volatile'-member function.

`DECL_CONSTRUCTOR_P'
     This macro holds if the function is a constructor.

`DECL_NONCONVERTING_P'
     This predicate holds if the constructor is a non-converting
     constructor.

`DECL_COMPLETE_CONSTRUCTOR_P'
     This predicate holds for a function which is a constructor for an
     object of a complete type.

`DECL_BASE_CONSTRUCTOR_P'
     This predicate holds for a function which is a constructor for a
     base class sub-object.

`DECL_COPY_CONSTRUCTOR_P'
     This predicate holds for a function which is a copy-constructor.

`DECL_DESTRUCTOR_P'
     This macro holds if the function is a destructor.

`DECL_COMPLETE_DESTRUCTOR_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is the destructor for an
     object a complete type.

`DECL_OVERLOADED_OPERATOR_P'
     This macro holds if the function is an overloaded operator.

`DECL_CONV_FN_P'
     This macro holds if the function is a type-conversion operator.

`DECL_GLOBAL_CTOR_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is a file-scope initialization
     function.

`DECL_GLOBAL_DTOR_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is a file-scope finalization
     function.

`DECL_THUNK_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is a thunk.

     These functions represent stub code that adjusts the `this' pointer
     and then jumps to another function.  When the jumped-to function
     returns, control is transferred directly to the caller, without
     returning to the thunk.  The first parameter to the thunk is
     always the `this' pointer; the thunk should add `THUNK_DELTA' to
     this value.  (The `THUNK_DELTA' is an `int', not an `INTEGER_CST'.)

     Then, if `THUNK_VCALL_OFFSET' (an `INTEGER_CST') is nonzero the
     adjusted `this' pointer must be adjusted again.  The complete
     calculation is given by the following pseudo-code:

          this += THUNK_DELTA
          if (THUNK_VCALL_OFFSET)
            this += (*((ptrdiff_t **) this))[THUNK_VCALL_OFFSET]

     Finally, the thunk should jump to the location given by
     `DECL_INITIAL'; this will always be an expression for the address
     of a function.

`DECL_NON_THUNK_FUNCTION_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is _not_ a thunk function.

`GLOBAL_INIT_PRIORITY'
     If either `DECL_GLOBAL_CTOR_P' or `DECL_GLOBAL_DTOR_P' holds, then
     this gives the initialization priority for the function.  The
     linker will arrange that all functions for which
     `DECL_GLOBAL_CTOR_P' holds are run in increasing order of priority
     before `main' is called.  When the program exits, all functions for
     which `DECL_GLOBAL_DTOR_P' holds are run in the reverse order.

`DECL_ARTIFICIAL'
     This macro holds if the function was implicitly generated by the
     compiler, rather than explicitly declared.  In addition to
     implicitly generated class member functions, this macro holds for
     the special functions created to implement static initialization
     and destruction, to compute run-time type information, and so
     forth.

`DECL_ARGUMENTS'
     This macro returns the `PARM_DECL' for the first argument to the
     function.  Subsequent `PARM_DECL' nodes can be obtained by
     following the `TREE_CHAIN' links.

`DECL_RESULT'
     This macro returns the `RESULT_DECL' for the function.

`TREE_TYPE'
     This macro returns the `FUNCTION_TYPE' or `METHOD_TYPE' for the
     function.

`TYPE_RAISES_EXCEPTIONS'
     This macro returns the list of exceptions that a (member-)function
     can raise.  The returned list, if non `NULL', is comprised of nodes
     whose `TREE_VALUE' represents a type.

`TYPE_NOTHROW_P'
     This predicate holds when the exception-specification of its
     arguments if of the form ``()''.

`DECL_ARRAY_DELETE_OPERATOR_P'
     This predicate holds if the function an overloaded `operator
     delete[]'.

8.6.2 Function Bodies
---------------------

A function that has a definition in the current translation unit will
have a non-`NULL' `DECL_INITIAL'.  However, back ends should not make
use of the particular value given by `DECL_INITIAL'.

   The `DECL_SAVED_TREE' macro will give the complete body of the
function.  This node will usually be a `COMPOUND_STMT' representing the
outermost block of the function, but it may also be a `TRY_BLOCK', a
`RETURN_INIT', or any other valid statement.

8.6.2.1 Statements
..................

There are tree nodes corresponding to all of the source-level statement
constructs.  These are enumerated here, together with a list of the
various macros that can be used to obtain information about them.  There
are a few macros that can be used with all statements:

`STMT_LINENO'
     This macro returns the line number for the statement.  If the
     statement spans multiple lines, this value will be the number of
     the first line on which the statement occurs.  Although we mention
     `CASE_LABEL' below as if it were a statement, they do not allow
     the use of `STMT_LINENO'.  There is no way to obtain the line
     number for a `CASE_LABEL'.

     Statements do not contain information about the file from which
     they came; that information is implicit in the `FUNCTION_DECL'
     from which the statements originate.

`STMT_IS_FULL_EXPR_P'
     In C++, statements normally constitute "full expressions";
     temporaries created during a statement are destroyed when the
     statement is complete.  However, G++ sometimes represents
     expressions by statements; these statements will not have
     `STMT_IS_FULL_EXPR_P' set.  Temporaries created during such
     statements should be destroyed when the innermost enclosing
     statement with `STMT_IS_FULL_EXPR_P' set is exited.


   Here is the list of the various statement nodes, and the macros used
to access them.  This documentation describes the use of these nodes in
non-template functions (including instantiations of template functions).
In template functions, the same nodes are used, but sometimes in
slightly different ways.

   Many of the statements have substatements.  For example, a `while'
loop will have a body, which is itself a statement.  If the substatement
is `NULL_TREE', it is considered equivalent to a statement consisting
of a single `;', i.e., an expression statement in which the expression
has been omitted.  A substatement may in fact be a list of statements,
connected via their `TREE_CHAIN's.  So, you should always process the
statement tree by looping over substatements, like this:
     void process_stmt (stmt)
          tree stmt;
     {
       while (stmt)
         {
           switch (TREE_CODE (stmt))
             {
             case IF_STMT:
               process_stmt (THEN_CLAUSE (stmt));
               /* More processing here.  */
               break;

             ...
             }

           stmt = TREE_CHAIN (stmt);
         }
     }
   In other words, while the `then' clause of an `if' statement in C++
can be only one statement (although that one statement may be a
compound statement), the intermediate representation will sometimes use
several statements chained together.

`ASM_STMT'
     Used to represent an inline assembly statement.  For an inline
     assembly statement like:
          asm ("mov x, y");
     The `ASM_STRING' macro will return a `STRING_CST' node for `"mov
     x, y"'.  If the original statement made use of the
     extended-assembly syntax, then `ASM_OUTPUTS', `ASM_INPUTS', and
     `ASM_CLOBBERS' will be the outputs, inputs, and clobbers for the
     statement, represented as `STRING_CST' nodes.  The
     extended-assembly syntax looks like:
          asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
     The first string is the `ASM_STRING', containing the instruction
     template.  The next two strings are the output and inputs,
     respectively; this statement has no clobbers.  As this example
     indicates, "plain" assembly statements are merely a special case
     of extended assembly statements; they have no cv-qualifiers,
     outputs, inputs, or clobbers.  All of the strings will be
     `NUL'-terminated, and will contain no embedded `NUL'-characters.

     If the assembly statement is declared `volatile', or if the
     statement was not an extended assembly statement, and is therefore
     implicitly volatile, then the predicate `ASM_VOLATILE_P' will hold
     of the `ASM_STMT'.

`BREAK_STMT'
     Used to represent a `break' statement.  There are no additional
     fields.

`CASE_LABEL'
     Use to represent a `case' label, range of `case' labels, or a
     `default' label.  If `CASE_LOW' is `NULL_TREE', then this is a
     `default' label.  Otherwise, if `CASE_HIGH' is `NULL_TREE', then
     this is an ordinary `case' label.  In this case, `CASE_LOW' is an
     expression giving the value of the label.  Both `CASE_LOW' and
     `CASE_HIGH' are `INTEGER_CST' nodes.  These values will have the
     same type as the condition expression in the switch statement.

     Otherwise, if both `CASE_LOW' and `CASE_HIGH' are defined, the
     statement is a range of case labels.  Such statements originate
     with the extension that allows users to write things of the form:
          case 2 ... 5:
     The first value will be `CASE_LOW', while the second will be
     `CASE_HIGH'.

`CLEANUP_STMT'
     Used to represent an action that should take place upon exit from
     the enclosing scope.  Typically, these actions are calls to
     destructors for local objects, but back ends cannot rely on this
     fact.  If these nodes are in fact representing such destructors,
     `CLEANUP_DECL' will be the `VAR_DECL' destroyed.  Otherwise,
     `CLEANUP_DECL' will be `NULL_TREE'.  In any case, the
     `CLEANUP_EXPR' is the expression to execute.  The cleanups
     executed on exit from a scope should be run in the reverse order
     of the order in which the associated `CLEANUP_STMT's were
     encountered.

`COMPOUND_STMT'
     Used to represent a brace-enclosed block.  The first substatement
     is given by `COMPOUND_BODY'.  Subsequent substatements are found by
     following the `TREE_CHAIN' link from one substatement to the next.
     The `COMPOUND_BODY' will be `NULL_TREE' if there are no
     substatements.

`CONTINUE_STMT'
     Used to represent a `continue' statement.  There are no additional
     fields.

`CTOR_STMT'
     Used to mark the beginning (if `CTOR_BEGIN_P' holds) or end (if
     `CTOR_END_P' holds of the main body of a constructor.  See also
     `SUBOBJECT' for more information on how to use these nodes.

`DECL_STMT'
     Used to represent a local declaration.  The `DECL_STMT_DECL' macro
     can be used to obtain the entity declared.  This declaration may
     be a `LABEL_DECL', indicating that the label declared is a local
     label.  (As an extension, GCC allows the declaration of labels
     with scope.)  In C, this declaration may be a `FUNCTION_DECL',
     indicating the use of the GCC nested function extension.  For more
     information, *note Functions::.

`DO_STMT'
     Used to represent a `do' loop.  The body of the loop is given by
     `DO_BODY' while the termination condition for the loop is given by
     `DO_COND'.  The condition for a `do'-statement is always an
     expression.

`EMPTY_CLASS_EXPR'
     Used to represent a temporary object of a class with no data whose
     address is never taken.  (All such objects are interchangeable.)
     The `TREE_TYPE' represents the type of the object.

`EXPR_STMT'
     Used to represent an expression statement.  Use `EXPR_STMT_EXPR' to
     obtain the expression.

`FILE_STMT'
     Used to record a change in filename within the body of a function.
     Use `FILE_STMT_FILENAME' to obtain the new filename.

`FOR_STMT'
     Used to represent a `for' statement.  The `FOR_INIT_STMT' is the
     initialization statement for the loop.  The `FOR_COND' is the
     termination condition.  The `FOR_EXPR' is the expression executed
     right before the `FOR_COND' on each loop iteration; often, this
     expression increments a counter.  The body of the loop is given by
     `FOR_BODY'.  Note that `FOR_INIT_STMT' and `FOR_BODY' return
     statements, while `FOR_COND' and `FOR_EXPR' return expressions.

`GOTO_STMT'
     Used to represent a `goto' statement.  The `GOTO_DESTINATION' will
     usually be a `LABEL_DECL'.  However, if the "computed goto"
     extension has been used, the `GOTO_DESTINATION' will be an
     arbitrary expression indicating the destination.  This expression
     will always have pointer type.  Additionally the `GOTO_FAKE_P'
     flag is set whenever the goto statement does not come from source
     code, but it is generated implicitly by the compiler.  This is
     used for branch prediction.

`HANDLER'
     Used to represent a C++ `catch' block.  The `HANDLER_TYPE' is the
     type of exception that will be caught by this handler; it is equal
     (by pointer equality) to `NULL' if this handler is for all types.
     `HANDLER_PARMS' is the `DECL_STMT' for the catch parameter, and
     `HANDLER_BODY' is the `COMPOUND_STMT' for the block itself.

`IF_STMT'
     Used to represent an `if' statement.  The `IF_COND' is the
     expression.

     If the condition is a `TREE_LIST', then the `TREE_PURPOSE' is a
     statement (usually a `DECL_STMT').  Each time the condition is
     evaluated, the statement should be executed.  Then, the
     `TREE_VALUE' should be used as the conditional expression itself.
     This representation is used to handle C++ code like this:

          if (int i = 7) ...

     where there is a new local variable (or variables) declared within
     the condition.

     The `THEN_CLAUSE' represents the statement given by the `then'
     condition, while the `ELSE_CLAUSE' represents the statement given
     by the `else' condition.

`LABEL_STMT'
     Used to represent a label.  The `LABEL_DECL' declared by this
     statement can be obtained with the `LABEL_STMT_LABEL' macro.  The
     `IDENTIFIER_NODE' giving the name of the label can be obtained from
     the `LABEL_DECL' with `DECL_NAME'.

`RETURN_INIT'
     If the function uses the G++ "named return value" extension,
     meaning that the function has been defined like:
          S f(int) return s {...}
     then there will be a `RETURN_INIT'.  There is never a named
     returned value for a constructor.  The first argument to the
     `RETURN_INIT' is the name of the object returned; the second
     argument is the initializer for the object.  The object is
     initialized when the `RETURN_INIT' is encountered.  The object
     referred to is the actual object returned; this extension is a
     manual way of doing the "return-value optimization."  Therefore,
     the object must actually be constructed in the place where the
     object will be returned.

`RETURN_STMT'
     Used to represent a `return' statement.  The `RETURN_EXPR' is the
     expression returned; it will be `NULL_TREE' if the statement was
     just
          return;

`SCOPE_STMT'
     A scope-statement represents the beginning or end of a scope.  If
     `SCOPE_BEGIN_P' holds, this statement represents the beginning of a
     scope; if `SCOPE_END_P' holds this statement represents the end of
     a scope.  On exit from a scope, all cleanups from `CLEANUP_STMT's
     occurring in the scope must be run, in reverse order to the order
     in which they were encountered.  If `SCOPE_NULLIFIED_P' or
     `SCOPE_NO_CLEANUPS_P' holds of the scope, back ends should behave
     as if the `SCOPE_STMT' were not present at all.

`SUBOBJECT'
     In a constructor, these nodes are used to mark the point at which a
     subobject of `this' is fully constructed.  If, after this point, an
     exception is thrown before a `CTOR_STMT' with `CTOR_END_P' set is
     encountered, the `SUBOBJECT_CLEANUP' must be executed.  The
     cleanups must be executed in the reverse order in which they
     appear.

`SWITCH_STMT'
     Used to represent a `switch' statement.  The `SWITCH_COND' is the
     expression on which the switch is occurring.  See the documentation
     for an `IF_STMT' for more information on the representation used
     for the condition.  The `SWITCH_BODY' is the body of the switch
     statement.   The `SWITCH_TYPE' is the original type of switch
     expression as given in the source, before any compiler conversions.

`TRY_BLOCK'
     Used to represent a `try' block.  The body of the try block is
     given by `TRY_STMTS'.  Each of the catch blocks is a `HANDLER'
     node.  The first handler is given by `TRY_HANDLERS'.  Subsequent
     handlers are obtained by following the `TREE_CHAIN' link from one
     handler to the next.  The body of the handler is given by
     `HANDLER_BODY'.

     If `CLEANUP_P' holds of the `TRY_BLOCK', then the `TRY_HANDLERS'
     will not be a `HANDLER' node.  Instead, it will be an expression
     that should be executed if an exception is thrown in the try
     block.  It must rethrow the exception after executing that code.
     And, if an exception is thrown while the expression is executing,
     `terminate' must be called.

`USING_STMT'
     Used to represent a `using' directive.  The namespace is given by
     `USING_STMT_NAMESPACE', which will be a NAMESPACE_DECL.  This node
     is needed inside template functions, to implement using directives
     during instantiation.

`WHILE_STMT'
     Used to represent a `while' loop.  The `WHILE_COND' is the
     termination condition for the loop.  See the documentation for an
     `IF_STMT' for more information on the representation used for the
     condition.

     The `WHILE_BODY' is the body of the loop.

8.7 Attributes in trees
=======================

Attributes, as specified using the `__attribute__' keyword, are
represented internally as a `TREE_LIST'.  The `TREE_PURPOSE' is the
name of the attribute, as an `IDENTIFIER_NODE'.  The `TREE_VALUE' is a
`TREE_LIST' of the arguments of the attribute, if any, or `NULL_TREE'
if there are no arguments; the arguments are stored as the `TREE_VALUE'
of successive entries in the list, and may be identifiers or
expressions.  The `TREE_CHAIN' of the attribute is the next attribute
in a list of attributes applying to the same declaration or type, or
`NULL_TREE' if there are no further attributes in the list.

   Attributes may be attached to declarations and to types; these
attributes may be accessed with the following macros.  All attributes
are stored in this way, and many also cause other changes to the
declaration or type or to other internal compiler data structures.

 -- Tree Macro: tree DECL_ATTRIBUTES (tree DECL)
     This macro returns the attributes on the declaration DECL.

 -- Tree Macro: tree TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (tree TYPE)
     This macro returns the attributes on the type TYPE.

8.8 Expressions
===============

The internal representation for expressions is for the most part quite
straightforward.  However, there are a few facts that one must bear in
mind.  In particular, the expression "tree" is actually a directed
acyclic graph.  (For example there may be many references to the integer
constant zero throughout the source program; many of these will be
represented by the same expression node.)  You should not rely on
certain kinds of node being shared, nor should rely on certain kinds of
nodes being unshared.

   The following macros can be used with all expression nodes:

`TREE_TYPE'
     Returns the type of the expression.  This value may not be
     precisely the same type that would be given the expression in the
     original program.

   In what follows, some nodes that one might expect to always have type
`bool' are documented to have either integral or boolean type.  At some
point in the future, the C front end may also make use of this same
intermediate representation, and at this point these nodes will
certainly have integral type.  The previous sentence is not meant to
imply that the C++ front end does not or will not give these nodes
integral type.

   Below, we list the various kinds of expression nodes.  Except where
noted otherwise, the operands to an expression are accessed using the
`TREE_OPERAND' macro.  For example, to access the first operand to a
binary plus expression `expr', use:

     TREE_OPERAND (expr, 0)
   As this example indicates, the operands are zero-indexed.

   The table below begins with constants, moves on to unary expressions,
then proceeds to binary expressions, and concludes with various other
kinds of expressions:

`INTEGER_CST'
     These nodes represent integer constants.  Note that the type of
     these constants is obtained with `TREE_TYPE'; they are not always
     of type `int'.  In particular, `char' constants are represented
     with `INTEGER_CST' nodes.  The value of the integer constant `e' is
     given by
          ((TREE_INT_CST_HIGH (e) << HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT)
          + TREE_INST_CST_LOW (e))
     HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT is at least thirty-two on all platforms.
     Both `TREE_INT_CST_HIGH' and `TREE_INT_CST_LOW' return a
     `HOST_WIDE_INT'.  The value of an `INTEGER_CST' is interpreted as
     a signed or unsigned quantity depending on the type of the
     constant.  In general, the expression given above will overflow,
     so it should not be used to calculate the value of the constant.

     The variable `integer_zero_node' is an integer constant with value
     zero.  Similarly, `integer_one_node' is an integer constant with
     value one.  The `size_zero_node' and `size_one_node' variables are
     analogous, but have type `size_t' rather than `int'.

     The function `tree_int_cst_lt' is a predicate which holds if its
     first argument is less than its second.  Both constants are
     assumed to have the same signedness (i.e., either both should be
     signed or both should be unsigned.)  The full width of the
     constant is used when doing the comparison; the usual rules about
     promotions and conversions are ignored.  Similarly,
     `tree_int_cst_equal' holds if the two constants are equal.  The
     `tree_int_cst_sgn' function returns the sign of a constant.  The
     value is `1', `0', or `-1' according on whether the constant is
     greater than, equal to, or less than zero.  Again, the signedness
     of the constant's type is taken into account; an unsigned constant
     is never less than zero, no matter what its bit-pattern.

`REAL_CST'
     FIXME: Talk about how to obtain representations of this constant,
     do comparisons, and so forth.

`COMPLEX_CST'
     These nodes are used to represent complex number constants, that
     is a `__complex__' whose parts are constant nodes.  The
     `TREE_REALPART' and `TREE_IMAGPART' return the real and the
     imaginary parts respectively.

`VECTOR_CST'
     These nodes are used to represent vector constants, whose parts are
     constant nodes.  Each individual constant node is either an
     integer or a double constant node.  The first operand is a
     `TREE_LIST' of the constant nodes and is accessed through
     `TREE_VECTOR_CST_ELTS'.

`STRING_CST'
     These nodes represent string-constants.  The `TREE_STRING_LENGTH'
     returns the length of the string, as an `int'.  The
     `TREE_STRING_POINTER' is a `char*' containing the string itself.
     The string may not be `NUL'-terminated, and it may contain
     embedded `NUL' characters.  Therefore, the `TREE_STRING_LENGTH'
     includes the trailing `NUL' if it is present.

     For wide string constants, the `TREE_STRING_LENGTH' is the number
     of bytes in the string, and the `TREE_STRING_POINTER' points to an
     array of the bytes of the string, as represented on the target
     system (that is, as integers in the target endianness).  Wide and
     non-wide string constants are distinguished only by the `TREE_TYPE'
     of the `STRING_CST'.

     FIXME: The formats of string constants are not well-defined when
     the target system bytes are not the same width as host system
     bytes.

`PTRMEM_CST'
     These nodes are used to represent pointer-to-member constants.  The
     `PTRMEM_CST_CLASS' is the class type (either a `RECORD_TYPE' or
     `UNION_TYPE' within which the pointer points), and the
     `PTRMEM_CST_MEMBER' is the declaration for the pointed to object.
     Note that the `DECL_CONTEXT' for the `PTRMEM_CST_MEMBER' is in
     general different from the `PTRMEM_CST_CLASS'.  For example, given:
          struct B { int i; };
          struct D : public B {};
          int D::*dp = &D::i;
     The `PTRMEM_CST_CLASS' for `&D::i' is `D', even though the
     `DECL_CONTEXT' for the `PTRMEM_CST_MEMBER' is `B', since `B::i' is
     a member of `B', not `D'.

`VAR_DECL'
     These nodes represent variables, including static data members.
     For more information, *note Declarations::.

`NEGATE_EXPR'
     These nodes represent unary negation of the single operand, for
     both integer and floating-point types.  The type of negation can be
     determined by looking at the type of the expression.

     The behavior of this operation on signed arithmetic overflow is
     controlled by the `flag_wrapv' and `flag_trapv' variables.

`ABS_EXPR'
     These nodes represent the absolute value of the single operand, for
     both integer and floating-point types.  This is typically used to
     implement the `abs', `labs' and `llabs' builtins for integer
     types, and the `fabs', `fabsf' and `fabsl' builtins for floating
     point types.  The type of abs operation can be determined by
     looking at the type of the expression.

     This node is not used for complex types.  To represent the modulus
     or complex abs of a complex value, use the `BUILT_IN_CABS',
     `BUILT_IN_CABSF' or `BUILT_IN_CABSL' builtins, as used to
     implement the C99 `cabs', `cabsf' and `cabsl' built-in functions.

`BIT_NOT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent bitwise complement, and will always have
     integral type.  The only operand is the value to be complemented.

`TRUTH_NOT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent logical negation, and will always have
     integral (or boolean) type.  The operand is the value being
     negated.

`PREDECREMENT_EXPR'
`PREINCREMENT_EXPR'
`POSTDECREMENT_EXPR'
`POSTINCREMENT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent increment and decrement expressions.  The
     value of the single operand is computed, and the operand
     incremented or decremented.  In the case of `PREDECREMENT_EXPR' and
     `PREINCREMENT_EXPR', the value of the expression is the value
     resulting after the increment or decrement; in the case of
     `POSTDECREMENT_EXPR' and `POSTINCREMENT_EXPR' is the value before
     the increment or decrement occurs.  The type of the operand, like
     that of the result, will be either integral, boolean, or
     floating-point.

`ADDR_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent the address of an object.  (These
     expressions will always have pointer or reference type.)  The
     operand may be another expression, or it may be a declaration.

     As an extension, GCC allows users to take the address of a label.
     In this case, the operand of the `ADDR_EXPR' will be a
     `LABEL_DECL'.  The type of such an expression is `void*'.

     If the object addressed is not an lvalue, a temporary is created,
     and the address of the temporary is used.

`INDIRECT_REF'
     These nodes are used to represent the object pointed to by a
     pointer.  The operand is the pointer being dereferenced; it will
     always have pointer or reference type.

`FIX_TRUNC_EXPR'
     These nodes represent conversion of a floating-point value to an
     integer.  The single operand will have a floating-point type,
     while the the complete expression will have an integral (or
     boolean) type.  The operand is rounded towards zero.

`FLOAT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent conversion of an integral (or boolean) value
     to a floating-point value.  The single operand will have integral
     type, while the complete expression will have a floating-point
     type.

     FIXME: How is the operand supposed to be rounded?  Is this
     dependent on `-mieee'?

`COMPLEX_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent complex numbers constructed from
     two expressions of the same (integer or real) type.  The first
     operand is the real part and the second operand is the imaginary
     part.

`CONJ_EXPR'
     These nodes represent the conjugate of their operand.

`REALPART_EXPR'
`IMAGPART_EXPR'
     These nodes represent respectively the real and the imaginary parts
     of complex numbers (their sole argument).

`NON_LVALUE_EXPR'
     These nodes indicate that their one and only operand is not an
     lvalue.  A back end can treat these identically to the single
     operand.

`NOP_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent conversions that do not require
     any code-generation.  For example, conversion of a `char*' to an
     `int*' does not require any code be generated; such a conversion is
     represented by a `NOP_EXPR'.  The single operand is the expression
     to be converted.  The conversion from a pointer to a reference is
     also represented with a `NOP_EXPR'.

`CONVERT_EXPR'
     These nodes are similar to `NOP_EXPR's, but are used in those
     situations where code may need to be generated.  For example, if an
     `int*' is converted to an `int' code may need to be generated on
     some platforms.  These nodes are never used for C++-specific
     conversions, like conversions between pointers to different
     classes in an inheritance hierarchy.  Any adjustments that need to
     be made in such cases are always indicated explicitly.  Similarly,
     a user-defined conversion is never represented by a
     `CONVERT_EXPR'; instead, the function calls are made explicit.

`THROW_EXPR'
     These nodes represent `throw' expressions.  The single operand is
     an expression for the code that should be executed to throw the
     exception.  However, there is one implicit action not represented
     in that expression; namely the call to `__throw'.  This function
     takes no arguments.  If `setjmp'/`longjmp' exceptions are used, the
     function `__sjthrow' is called instead.  The normal GCC back end
     uses the function `emit_throw' to generate this code; you can
     examine this function to see what needs to be done.

`LSHIFT_EXPR'
`RSHIFT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent left and right shifts, respectively.  The
     first operand is the value to shift; it will always be of integral
     type.  The second operand is an expression for the number of bits
     by which to shift.  Right shift should be treated as arithmetic,
     i.e., the high-order bits should be zero-filled when the
     expression has unsigned type and filled with the sign bit when the
     expression has signed type.  Note that the result is undefined if
     the second operand is larger than the first operand's type size.

`BIT_IOR_EXPR'
`BIT_XOR_EXPR'
`BIT_AND_EXPR'
     These nodes represent bitwise inclusive or, bitwise exclusive or,
     and bitwise and, respectively.  Both operands will always have
     integral type.

`TRUTH_ANDIF_EXPR'
`TRUTH_ORIF_EXPR'
     These nodes represent logical and and logical or, respectively.
     These operators are not strict; i.e., the second operand is
     evaluated only if the value of the expression is not determined by
     evaluation of the first operand.  The type of the operands, and
     the result type, is always of boolean or integral type.

`TRUTH_AND_EXPR'
`TRUTH_OR_EXPR'
`TRUTH_XOR_EXPR'
     These nodes represent logical and, logical or, and logical
     exclusive or.  They are strict; both arguments are always
     evaluated.  There are no corresponding operators in C or C++, but
     the front end will sometimes generate these expressions anyhow, if
     it can tell that strictness does not matter.

`PLUS_EXPR'
`MINUS_EXPR'
`MULT_EXPR'
`TRUNC_DIV_EXPR'
`TRUNC_MOD_EXPR'
`RDIV_EXPR'
     These nodes represent various binary arithmetic operations.
     Respectively, these operations are addition, subtraction (of the
     second operand from the first), multiplication, integer division,
     integer remainder, and floating-point division.  The operands to
     the first three of these may have either integral or floating
     type, but there will never be case in which one operand is of
     floating type and the other is of integral type.

     The result of a `TRUNC_DIV_EXPR' is always rounded towards zero.
     The `TRUNC_MOD_EXPR' of two operands `a' and `b' is always `a -
     (a/b)*b' where the division is as if computed by a
     `TRUNC_DIV_EXPR'.

     The behavior of these operations on signed arithmetic overflow is
     controlled by the `flag_wrapv' and `flag_trapv' variables.

`ARRAY_REF'
     These nodes represent array accesses.  The first operand is the
     array; the second is the index.  To calculate the address of the
     memory accessed, you must scale the index by the size of the type
     of the array elements.  The type of these expressions must be the
     type of a component of the array.

`ARRAY_RANGE_REF'
     These nodes represent access to a range (or "slice") of an array.
     The operands are the same as that for `ARRAY_REF' and have the same
     meanings.  The type of these expressions must be an array whose
     component type is the same as that of the first operand.  The
     range of that array type determines the amount of data these
     expressions access.

`EXACT_DIV_EXPR'
     Document.

`LT_EXPR'
`LE_EXPR'
`GT_EXPR'
`GE_EXPR'
`EQ_EXPR'
`NE_EXPR'
     These nodes represent the less than, less than or equal to, greater
     than, greater than or equal to, equal, and not equal comparison
     operators.  The first and second operand with either be both of
     integral type or both of floating type.  The result type of these
     expressions will always be of integral or boolean type.

`MODIFY_EXPR'
     These nodes represent assignment.  The left-hand side is the first
     operand; the right-hand side is the second operand.  The left-hand
     side will be a `VAR_DECL', `INDIRECT_REF', `COMPONENT_REF', or
     other lvalue.

     These nodes are used to represent not only assignment with `=' but
     also compound assignments (like `+='), by reduction to `='
     assignment.  In other words, the representation for `i += 3' looks
     just like that for `i = i + 3'.

`INIT_EXPR'
     These nodes are just like `MODIFY_EXPR', but are used only when a
     variable is initialized, rather than assigned to subsequently.

`COMPONENT_REF'
     These nodes represent non-static data member accesses.  The first
     operand is the object (rather than a pointer to it); the second
     operand is the `FIELD_DECL' for the data member.

`COMPOUND_EXPR'
     These nodes represent comma-expressions.  The first operand is an
     expression whose value is computed and thrown away prior to the
     evaluation of the second operand.  The value of the entire
     expression is the value of the second operand.

`COND_EXPR'
     These nodes represent `?:' expressions.  The first operand is of
     boolean or integral type.  If it evaluates to a nonzero value, the
     second operand should be evaluated, and returned as the value of
     the expression.  Otherwise, the third operand is evaluated, and
     returned as the value of the expression.

     The second operand must have the same type as the entire
     expression, unless it unconditionally throws an exception or calls
     a noreturn function, in which case it should have void type.  The
     same constraints apply to the third operand.  This allows array
     bounds checks to be represented conveniently as `(i >= 0 && i <
     10) ? i : abort()'.

     As a GNU extension, the C language front-ends allow the second
     operand of the `?:' operator may be omitted in the source.  For
     example, `x ? : 3' is equivalent to `x ? x : 3', assuming that `x'
     is an expression without side-effects.  In the tree
     representation, however, the second operand is always present,
     possibly protected by `SAVE_EXPR' if the first argument does cause
     side-effects.

`CALL_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent calls to functions, including
     non-static member functions.  The first operand is a pointer to the
     function to call; it is always an expression whose type is a
     `POINTER_TYPE'.  The second argument is a `TREE_LIST'.  The
     arguments to the call appear left-to-right in the list.  The
     `TREE_VALUE' of each list node contains the expression
     corresponding to that argument.  (The value of `TREE_PURPOSE' for
     these nodes is unspecified, and should be ignored.)  For non-static
     member functions, there will be an operand corresponding to the
     `this' pointer.  There will always be expressions corresponding to
     all of the arguments, even if the function is declared with default
     arguments and some arguments are not explicitly provided at the
     call sites.

`STMT_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent GCC's statement-expression
     extension.  The statement-expression extension allows code like
     this:
          int f() { return ({ int j; j = 3; j + 7; }); }
     In other words, an sequence of statements may occur where a single
     expression would normally appear.  The `STMT_EXPR' node represents
     such an expression.  The `STMT_EXPR_STMT' gives the statement
     contained in the expression; this is always a `COMPOUND_STMT'.  The
     value of the expression is the value of the last sub-statement in
     the `COMPOUND_STMT'.  More precisely, the value is the value
     computed by the last `EXPR_STMT' in the outermost scope of the
     `COMPOUND_STMT'.  For example, in:
          ({ 3; })
     the value is `3' while in:
          ({ if (x) { 3; } })
     (represented by a nested `COMPOUND_STMT'), there is no value.  If
     the `STMT_EXPR' does not yield a value, it's type will be `void'.

`BIND_EXPR'
     These nodes represent local blocks.  The first operand is a list of
     temporary variables, connected via their `TREE_CHAIN' field.  These
     will never require cleanups.  The scope of these variables is just
     the body of the `BIND_EXPR'.  The body of the `BIND_EXPR' is the
     second operand.

`LOOP_EXPR'
     These nodes represent "infinite" loops.  The `LOOP_EXPR_BODY'
     represents the body of the loop.  It should be executed forever,
     unless an `EXIT_EXPR' is encountered.

`EXIT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent conditional exits from the nearest enclosing
     `LOOP_EXPR'.  The single operand is the condition; if it is
     nonzero, then the loop should be exited.  An `EXIT_EXPR' will only
     appear within a `LOOP_EXPR'.

`CLEANUP_POINT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent full-expressions.  The single operand is an
     expression to evaluate.  Any destructor calls engendered by the
     creation of temporaries during the evaluation of that expression
     should be performed immediately after the expression is evaluated.

`CONSTRUCTOR'
     These nodes represent the brace-enclosed initializers for a
     structure or array.  The first operand is reserved for use by the
     back end.  The second operand is a `TREE_LIST'.  If the
     `TREE_TYPE' of the `CONSTRUCTOR' is a `RECORD_TYPE' or
     `UNION_TYPE', then the `TREE_PURPOSE' of each node in the
     `TREE_LIST' will be a `FIELD_DECL' and the `TREE_VALUE' of each
     node will be the expression used to initialize that field.

     If the `TREE_TYPE' of the `CONSTRUCTOR' is an `ARRAY_TYPE', then
     the `TREE_PURPOSE' of each element in the `TREE_LIST' will be an
     `INTEGER_CST'.  This constant indicates which element of the array
     (indexed from zero) is being assigned to; again, the `TREE_VALUE'
     is the corresponding initializer.  If the `TREE_PURPOSE' is
     `NULL_TREE', then the initializer is for the next available array
     element.

     In the front end, you should not depend on the fields appearing in
     any particular order.  However, in the middle end, fields must
     appear in declaration order.  You should not assume that all
     fields will be represented.  Unrepresented fields will be set to
     zero.

`COMPOUND_LITERAL_EXPR'
     These nodes represent ISO C99 compound literals.  The
     `COMPOUND_LITERAL_EXPR_DECL_STMT' is a `DECL_STMT' containing an
     anonymous `VAR_DECL' for the unnamed object represented by the
     compound literal; the `DECL_INITIAL' of that `VAR_DECL' is a
     `CONSTRUCTOR' representing the brace-enclosed list of initializers
     in the compound literal.  That anonymous `VAR_DECL' can also be
     accessed directly by the `COMPOUND_LITERAL_EXPR_DECL' macro.

`SAVE_EXPR'
     A `SAVE_EXPR' represents an expression (possibly involving
     side-effects) that is used more than once.  The side-effects should
     occur only the first time the expression is evaluated.  Subsequent
     uses should just reuse the computed value.  The first operand to
     the `SAVE_EXPR' is the expression to evaluate.  The side-effects
     should be executed where the `SAVE_EXPR' is first encountered in a
     depth-first preorder traversal of the expression tree.

`TARGET_EXPR'
     A `TARGET_EXPR' represents a temporary object.  The first operand
     is a `VAR_DECL' for the temporary variable.  The second operand is
     the initializer for the temporary.  The initializer is evaluated,
     and copied (bitwise) into the temporary.

     Often, a `TARGET_EXPR' occurs on the right-hand side of an
     assignment, or as the second operand to a comma-expression which is
     itself the right-hand side of an assignment, etc.  In this case,
     we say that the `TARGET_EXPR' is "normal"; otherwise, we say it is
     "orphaned".  For a normal `TARGET_EXPR' the temporary variable
     should be treated as an alias for the left-hand side of the
     assignment, rather than as a new temporary variable.

     The third operand to the `TARGET_EXPR', if present, is a
     cleanup-expression (i.e., destructor call) for the temporary.  If
     this expression is orphaned, then this expression must be executed
     when the statement containing this expression is complete.  These
     cleanups must always be executed in the order opposite to that in
     which they were encountered.  Note that if a temporary is created
     on one branch of a conditional operator (i.e., in the second or
     third operand to a `COND_EXPR'), the cleanup must be run only if
     that branch is actually executed.

     See `STMT_IS_FULL_EXPR_P' for more information about running these
     cleanups.

`AGGR_INIT_EXPR'
     An `AGGR_INIT_EXPR' represents the initialization as the return
     value of a function call, or as the result of a constructor.  An
     `AGGR_INIT_EXPR' will only appear as the second operand of a
     `TARGET_EXPR'.  The first operand to the `AGGR_INIT_EXPR' is the
     address of a function to call, just as in a `CALL_EXPR'.  The
     second operand are the arguments to pass that function, as a
     `TREE_LIST', again in a manner similar to that of a `CALL_EXPR'.
     The value of the expression is that returned by the function.

     If `AGGR_INIT_VIA_CTOR_P' holds of the `AGGR_INIT_EXPR', then the
     initialization is via a constructor call.  The address of the third
     operand of the `AGGR_INIT_EXPR', which is always a `VAR_DECL', is
     taken, and this value replaces the first argument in the argument
     list.  In this case, the value of the expression is the `VAR_DECL'
     given by the third operand to the `AGGR_INIT_EXPR'; constructors do
     not return a value.

`VTABLE_REF'
     A `VTABLE_REF' indicates that the interior expression computes a
     value that is a vtable entry.  It is used with `-fvtable-gc' to
     track the reference through to front end to the middle end, at
     which point we transform this to a `REG_VTABLE_REF' note, which
     survives the balance of code generation.

     The first operand is the expression that computes the vtable
     reference.  The second operand is the `VAR_DECL' of the vtable.
     The third operand is an `INTEGER_CST' of the byte offset into the
     vtable.

`VA_ARG_EXPR'
     This node is used to implement support for the C/C++ variable
     argument-list mechanism.  It represents expressions like `va_arg
     (ap, type)'.  Its `TREE_TYPE' yields the tree representation for
     `type' and its sole argument yields the representation for `ap'.

9 RTL Representation
********************

Most of the work of the compiler is done on an intermediate
representation called register transfer language.  In this language,
the instructions to be output are described, pretty much one by one, in
an algebraic form that describes what the instruction does.

   RTL is inspired by Lisp lists.  It has both an internal form, made
up of structures that point at other structures, and a textual form
that is used in the machine description and in printed debugging dumps.
The textual form uses nested parentheses to indicate the pointers in
the internal form.

9.1 RTL Object Types
====================

RTL uses five kinds of objects: expressions, integers, wide integers,
strings and vectors.  Expressions are the most important ones.  An RTL
expression ("RTX", for short) is a C structure, but it is usually
referred to with a pointer; a type that is given the typedef name `rtx'.

   An integer is simply an `int'; their written form uses decimal
digits.  A wide integer is an integral object whose type is
`HOST_WIDE_INT'; their written form uses decimal digits.

   A string is a sequence of characters.  In core it is represented as a
`char *' in usual C fashion, and it is written in C syntax as well.
However, strings in RTL may never be null.  If you write an empty
string in a machine description, it is represented in core as a null
pointer rather than as a pointer to a null character.  In certain
contexts, these null pointers instead of strings are valid.  Within RTL
code, strings are most commonly found inside `symbol_ref' expressions,
but they appear in other contexts in the RTL expressions that make up
machine descriptions.

   In a machine description, strings are normally written with double
quotes, as you would in C.  However, strings in machine descriptions may
extend over many lines, which is invalid C, and adjacent string
constants are not concatenated as they are in C.  Any string constant
may be surrounded with a single set of parentheses.  Sometimes this
makes the machine description easier to read.

   There is also a special syntax for strings, which can be useful when
C code is embedded in a machine description.  Wherever a string can
appear, it is also valid to write a C-style brace block.  The entire
brace block, including the outermost pair of braces, is considered to be
the string constant.  Double quote characters inside the braces are not
special.  Therefore, if you write string constants in the C code, you
need not escape each quote character with a backslash.

   A vector contains an arbitrary number of pointers to expressions.
The number of elements in the vector is explicitly present in the
vector.  The written form of a vector consists of square brackets
(`[...]') surrounding the elements, in sequence and with whitespace
separating them.  Vectors of length zero are not created; null pointers
are used instead.

   Expressions are classified by "expression codes" (also called RTX
codes).  The expression code is a name defined in `rtl.def', which is
also (in uppercase) a C enumeration constant.  The possible expression
codes and their meanings are machine-independent.  The code of an RTX
can be extracted with the macro `GET_CODE (X)' and altered with
`PUT_CODE (X, NEWCODE)'.

   The expression code determines how many operands the expression
contains, and what kinds of objects they are.  In RTL, unlike Lisp, you
cannot tell by looking at an operand what kind of object it is.
Instead, you must know from its context--from the expression code of
the containing expression.  For example, in an expression of code
`subreg', the first operand is to be regarded as an expression and the
second operand as an integer.  In an expression of code `plus', there
are two operands, both of which are to be regarded as expressions.  In
a `symbol_ref' expression, there is one operand, which is to be
regarded as a string.

   Expressions are written as parentheses containing the name of the
expression type, its flags and machine mode if any, and then the
operands of the expression (separated by spaces).

   Expression code names in the `md' file are written in lowercase, but
when they appear in C code they are written in uppercase.  In this
manual, they are shown as follows: `const_int'.

   In a few contexts a null pointer is valid where an expression is
normally wanted.  The written form of this is `(nil)'.

9.2 RTL Classes and Formats
===========================

The various expression codes are divided into several "classes", which
are represented by single characters.  You can determine the class of
an RTX code with the macro `GET_RTX_CLASS (CODE)'.  Currently,
`rtx.def' defines these classes:

`o'
     An RTX code that represents an actual object, such as a register
     (`REG') or a memory location (`MEM', `SYMBOL_REF').  Constants and
     basic transforms on objects (`ADDRESSOF', `HIGH', `LO_SUM') are
     also included.  Note that `SUBREG' and `STRICT_LOW_PART' are not
     in this class, but in class `x'.

`<'
     An RTX code for a comparison, such as `NE' or `LT'.

`1'
     An RTX code for a unary arithmetic operation, such as `NEG',
     `NOT', or `ABS'.  This category also includes value extension
     (sign or zero) and conversions between integer and floating point.

`c'
     An RTX code for a commutative binary operation, such as `PLUS' or
     `AND'.  `NE' and `EQ' are comparisons, so they have class `<'.

`2'
     An RTX code for a non-commutative binary operation, such as
     `MINUS', `DIV', or `ASHIFTRT'.

`b'
     An RTX code for a bit-field operation.  Currently only
     `ZERO_EXTRACT' and `SIGN_EXTRACT'.  These have three inputs and
     are lvalues (so they can be used for insertion as well).  *Note
     Bit-Fields::.

`3'
     An RTX code for other three input operations.  Currently only
     `IF_THEN_ELSE'.

`i'
     An RTX code for an entire instruction:  `INSN', `JUMP_INSN', and
     `CALL_INSN'.  *Note Insns::.

`m'
     An RTX code for something that matches in insns, such as
     `MATCH_DUP'.  These only occur in machine descriptions.

`a'
     An RTX code for an auto-increment addressing mode, such as
     `POST_INC'.

`x'
     All other RTX codes.  This category includes the remaining codes
     used only in machine descriptions (`DEFINE_*', etc.).  It also
     includes all the codes describing side effects (`SET', `USE',
     `CLOBBER', etc.) and the non-insns that may appear on an insn
     chain, such as `NOTE', `BARRIER', and `CODE_LABEL'.

   For each expression code, `rtl.def' specifies the number of
contained objects and their kinds using a sequence of characters called
the "format" of the expression code.  For example, the format of
`subreg' is `ei'.

   These are the most commonly used format characters:

`e'
     An expression (actually a pointer to an expression).

`i'
     An integer.

`w'
     A wide integer.

`s'
     A string.

`E'
     A vector of expressions.

   A few other format characters are used occasionally:

`u'
     `u' is equivalent to `e' except that it is printed differently in
     debugging dumps.  It is used for pointers to insns.

`n'
     `n' is equivalent to `i' except that it is printed differently in
     debugging dumps.  It is used for the line number or code number of
     a `note' insn.

`S'
     `S' indicates a string which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
     core, `S' is equivalent to `s', but when the object is read, from
     an `md' file, the string value of this operand may be omitted.  An
     omitted string is taken to be the null string.

`V'
     `V' indicates a vector which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
     core, `V' is equivalent to `E', but when the object is read from
     an `md' file, the vector value of this operand may be omitted.  An
     omitted vector is effectively the same as a vector of no elements.

`B'
     `B' indicates a pointer to basic block structure.

`0'
     `0' means a slot whose contents do not fit any normal category.
     `0' slots are not printed at all in dumps, and are often used in
     special ways by small parts of the compiler.

   There are macros to get the number of operands and the format of an
expression code:

`GET_RTX_LENGTH (CODE)'
     Number of operands of an RTX of code CODE.

`GET_RTX_FORMAT (CODE)'
     The format of an RTX of code CODE, as a C string.

   Some classes of RTX codes always have the same format.  For example,
it is safe to assume that all comparison operations have format `ee'.

`1'
     All codes of this class have format `e'.

`<'
`c'
`2'
     All codes of these classes have format `ee'.

`b'
`3'
     All codes of these classes have format `eee'.

`i'
     All codes of this class have formats that begin with `iuueiee'.
     *Note Insns::.  Note that not all RTL objects linked onto an insn
     chain are of class `i'.

`o'
`m'
`x'
     You can make no assumptions about the format of these codes.

9.3 Access to Operands
======================

Operands of expressions are accessed using the macros `XEXP', `XINT',
`XWINT' and `XSTR'.  Each of these macros takes two arguments: an
expression-pointer (RTX) and an operand number (counting from zero).
Thus,

     XEXP (X, 2)

accesses operand 2 of expression X, as an expression.

     XINT (X, 2)

accesses the same operand as an integer.  `XSTR', used in the same
fashion, would access it as a string.

   Any operand can be accessed as an integer, as an expression or as a
string.  You must choose the correct method of access for the kind of
value actually stored in the operand.  You would do this based on the
expression code of the containing expression.  That is also how you
would know how many operands there are.

   For example, if X is a `subreg' expression, you know that it has two
operands which can be correctly accessed as `XEXP (X, 0)' and `XINT (X,
1)'.  If you did `XINT (X, 0)', you would get the address of the
expression operand but cast as an integer; that might occasionally be
useful, but it would be cleaner to write `(int) XEXP (X, 0)'.  `XEXP
(X, 1)' would also compile without error, and would return the second,
integer operand cast as an expression pointer, which would probably
result in a crash when accessed.  Nothing stops you from writing `XEXP
(X, 28)' either, but this will access memory past the end of the
expression with unpredictable results.

   Access to operands which are vectors is more complicated.  You can
use the macro `XVEC' to get the vector-pointer itself, or the macros
`XVECEXP' and `XVECLEN' to access the elements and length of a vector.

`XVEC (EXP, IDX)'
     Access the vector-pointer which is operand number IDX in EXP.

`XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'
     Access the length (number of elements) in the vector which is in
     operand number IDX in EXP.  This value is an `int'.

`XVECEXP (EXP, IDX, ELTNUM)'
     Access element number ELTNUM in the vector which is in operand
     number IDX in EXP.  This value is an RTX.

     It is up to you to make sure that ELTNUM is not negative and is
     less than `XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'.

   All the macros defined in this section expand into lvalues and
therefore can be used to assign the operands, lengths and vector
elements as well as to access them.

9.4 Access to Special Operands
==============================

Some RTL nodes have special annotations associated with them.

`MEM'

    `MEM_ALIAS_SET (X)'
          If 0, X is not in any alias set, and may alias anything.
          Otherwise, X can only alias `MEM's in a conflicting alias
          set.  This value is set in a language-dependent manner in the
          front-end, and should not be altered in the back-end.  In
          some front-ends, these numbers may correspond in some way to
          types, or other language-level entities, but they need not,
          and the back-end makes no such assumptions.  These set
          numbers are tested with `alias_sets_conflict_p'.

    `MEM_EXPR (X)'
          If this register is known to hold the value of some user-level
          declaration, this is that tree node.  It may also be a
          `COMPONENT_REF', in which case this is some field reference,
          and `TREE_OPERAND (X, 0)' contains the declaration, or
          another `COMPONENT_REF', or null if there is no compile-time
          object associated with the reference.

    `MEM_OFFSET (X)'
          The offset from the start of `MEM_EXPR' as a `CONST_INT' rtx.

    `MEM_SIZE (X)'
          The size in bytes of the memory reference as a `CONST_INT'
          rtx.  This is mostly relevant for `BLKmode' references as
          otherwise the size is implied by the mode.

    `MEM_ALIGN (X)'
          The known alignment in bits of the memory reference.

`REG'

    `ORIGINAL_REGNO (X)'
          This field holds the number the register "originally" had;
          for a pseudo register turned into a hard reg this will hold
          the old pseudo register number.

    `REG_EXPR (X)'
          If this register is known to hold the value of some user-level
          declaration, this is that tree node.

    `REG_OFFSET (X)'
          If this register is known to hold the value of some user-level
          declaration, this is the offset into that logical storage.

`SYMBOL_REF'

    `SYMBOL_REF_DECL (X)'
          If the `symbol_ref' X was created for a `VAR_DECL' or a
          `FUNCTION_DECL', that tree is recorded here.  If this value is
          null, then X was created by back end code generation routines,
          and there is no associated front end symbol table entry.

          `SYMBOL_REF_DECL' may also point to a tree of class `'c'',
          that is, some sort of constant.  In this case, the
          `symbol_ref' is an entry in the per-file constant pool;
          again, there is no associated front end symbol table entry.

    `SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS (X)'
          In a `symbol_ref', this is used to communicate various
          predicates about the symbol.  Some of these are common enough
          to be computed by common code, some are specific to the
          target.  The common bits are:

         `SYMBOL_FLAG_FUNCTION'
               Set if the symbol refers to a function.

         `SYMBOL_FLAG_LOCAL'
               Set if the symbol is local to this "module".  See
               `TARGET_BINDS_LOCAL_P'.

         `SYMBOL_FLAG_EXTERNAL'
               Set if this symbol is not defined in this translation
               unit.  Note that this is not the inverse of
               `SYMBOL_FLAG_LOCAL'.

         `SYMBOL_FLAG_SMALL'
               Set if the symbol is located in the small data section.
               See `TARGET_IN_SMALL_DATA_P'.

         `SYMBOL_REF_TLS_MODEL (X)'
               This is a multi-bit field accessor that returns the
               `tls_model' to be used for a thread-local storage
               symbol.  It returns zero for non-thread-local symbols.

          Bits beginning with `SYMBOL_FLAG_MACH_DEP' are available for
          the target's use.

9.5 Flags in an RTL Expression
==============================

RTL expressions contain several flags (one-bit bit-fields) that are
used in certain types of expression.  Most often they are accessed with
the following macros, which expand into lvalues.

`CONSTANT_POOL_ADDRESS_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a `symbol_ref' if it refers to part of the current
     function's constant pool.  For most targets these addresses are in
     a `.rodata' section entirely separate from the function, but for
     some targets the addresses are close to the beginning of the
     function.  In either case GCC assumes these addresses can be
     addressed directly, perhaps with the help of base registers.
     Stored in the `unchanging' field and printed as `/u'.

`CONST_OR_PURE_CALL_P (X)'
     In a `call_insn', `note', or an `expr_list' for notes, indicates
     that the insn represents a call to a const or pure function.
     Stored in the `unchanging' field and printed as `/u'.

`INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P (X)'
     In a `jump_insn', `call_insn', or `insn' indicates that the branch
     is an annulling one.  See the discussion under `sequence' below.
     Stored in the `unchanging' field and printed as `/u'.

`INSN_DEAD_CODE_P (X)'
     In an `insn' during the dead-code elimination pass, nonzero if the
     insn is dead.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`INSN_DELETED_P (X)'
     In an `insn', `call_insn', `jump_insn', `code_label', `barrier',
     or `note', nonzero if the insn has been deleted.  Stored in the
     `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.

`INSN_FROM_TARGET_P (X)'
     In an `insn' or `jump_insn' or `call_insn' in a delay slot of a
     branch, indicates that the insn is from the target of the branch.
     If the branch insn has `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' set, this insn
     will only be executed if the branch is taken.  For annulled
     branches with `INSN_FROM_TARGET_P' clear, the insn will be
     executed only if the branch is not taken.  When
     `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' is not set, this insn will always be
     executed.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`LABEL_OUTSIDE_LOOP_P (X)'
     In `label_ref' expressions, nonzero if this is a reference to a
     label that is outside the innermost loop containing the reference
     to the label.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`LABEL_PRESERVE_P (X)'
     In a `code_label' or `note', indicates that the label is
     referenced by code or data not visible to the RTL of a given
     function.  Labels referenced by a non-local goto will have this
     bit set.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`LABEL_REF_NONLOCAL_P (X)'
     In `label_ref' and `reg_label' expressions, nonzero if this is a
     reference to a non-local label.  Stored in the `volatil' field and
     printed as `/v'.

`MEM_IN_STRUCT_P (X)'
     In `mem' expressions, nonzero for reference to an entire structure,
     union or array, or to a component of one.  Zero for references to a
     scalar variable or through a pointer to a scalar.  If both this
     flag and `MEM_SCALAR_P' are clear, then we don't know whether this
     `mem' is in a structure or not.  Both flags should never be
     simultaneously set.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed
     as `/s'.

`MEM_KEEP_ALIAS_SET_P (X)'
     In `mem' expressions, 1 if we should keep the alias set for this
     mem unchanged when we access a component.  Set to 1, for example,
     when we are already in a non-addressable component of an aggregate.
     Stored in the `jump' field and printed as `/j'.

`MEM_SCALAR_P (X)'
     In `mem' expressions, nonzero for reference to a scalar known not
     to be a member of a structure, union, or array.  Zero for such
     references and for indirections through pointers, even pointers
     pointing to scalar types.  If both this flag and `MEM_IN_STRUCT_P'
     are clear, then we don't know whether this `mem' is in a structure
     or not.  Both flags should never be simultaneously set.  Stored in
     the `frame_related' field and printed as `/f'.

`MEM_VOLATILE_P (X)'
     In `mem', `asm_operands', and `asm_input' expressions, nonzero for
     volatile memory references.  Stored in the `volatil' field and
     printed as `/v'.

`MEM_NOTRAP_P (X)'
     In `mem', nonzero for memory references that will not trap.
     Stored in the `call' field and printed as `/c'.

`REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a `reg' if it is the place in which this function's
     value is going to be returned.  (This happens only in a hard
     register.)  Stored in the `integrated' field and printed as `/i'.

`REG_LOOP_TEST_P (X)'
     In `reg' expressions, nonzero if this register's entire life is
     contained in the exit test code for some loop.  Stored in the
     `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`REG_POINTER (X)'
     Nonzero in a `reg' if the register holds a pointer.  Stored in the
     `frame_related' field and printed as `/f'.

`REG_USERVAR_P (X)'
     In a `reg', nonzero if it corresponds to a variable present in the
     user's source code.  Zero for temporaries generated internally by
     the compiler.  Stored in the `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.

     The same hard register may be used also for collecting the values
     of functions called by this one, but `REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P' is zero
     in this kind of use.

`RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P (X)'
     Nonzero in an `insn', `call_insn', `jump_insn', `barrier', or
     `set' which is part of a function prologue and sets the stack
     pointer, sets the frame pointer, or saves a register.  This flag
     should also be set on an instruction that sets up a temporary
     register to use in place of the frame pointer.  Stored in the
     `frame_related' field and printed as `/f'.

     In particular, on RISC targets where there are limits on the sizes
     of immediate constants, it is sometimes impossible to reach the
     register save area directly from the stack pointer.  In that case,
     a temporary register is used that is near enough to the register
     save area, and the Canonical Frame Address, i.e., DWARF2's logical
     frame pointer, register must (temporarily) be changed to be this
     temporary register.  So, the instruction that sets this temporary
     register must be marked as `RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P'.

     If the marked instruction is overly complex (defined in terms of
     what `dwarf2out_frame_debug_expr' can handle), you will also have
     to create a `REG_FRAME_RELATED_EXPR' note and attach it to the
     instruction.  This note should contain a simple expression of the
     computation performed by this instruction, i.e., one that
     `dwarf2out_frame_debug_expr' can handle.

     This flag is required for exception handling support on targets
     with RTL prologues.

`RTX_INTEGRATED_P (X)'
     Nonzero in an `insn', `call_insn', `jump_insn', `barrier',
     `code_label', `insn_list', `const', or `note' if it resulted from
     an in-line function call.  Stored in the `integrated' field and
     printed as `/i'.

`RTX_UNCHANGING_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a `reg', `mem', or `concat' if the register or memory
     is set at most once, anywhere.  This does not mean that it is
     function invariant.

     GCC uses this flag to determine whether two references conflict.
     As implemented by `true_dependence' in `alias.c' for memory
     references, unchanging memory can't conflict with non-unchanging
     memory; a non-unchanging read can conflict with a non-unchanging
     write; an unchanging read can conflict with an unchanging write
     (since there may be a single store to this address to initialize
     it); and an unchanging store can conflict with a non-unchanging
     read.  This means we must make conservative assumptions when
     choosing the value of this flag for a memory reference to an
     object containing both unchanging and non-unchanging fields: we
     must set the flag when writing to the object and clear it when
     reading from the object.

     Stored in the `unchanging' field and printed as `/u'.

`SCHED_GROUP_P (X)'
     During instruction scheduling, in an `insn', `call_insn' or
     `jump_insn', indicates that the previous insn must be scheduled
     together with this insn.  This is used to ensure that certain
     groups of instructions will not be split up by the instruction
     scheduling pass, for example, `use' insns before a `call_insn' may
     not be separated from the `call_insn'.  Stored in the `in_struct'
     field and printed as `/s'.

`SET_IS_RETURN_P (X)'
     For a `set', nonzero if it is for a return.  Stored in the `jump'
     field and printed as `/j'.

`SIBLING_CALL_P (X)'
     For a `call_insn', nonzero if the insn is a sibling call.  Stored
     in the `jump' field and printed as `/j'.

`STRING_POOL_ADDRESS_P (X)'
     For a `symbol_ref' expression, nonzero if it addresses this
     function's string constant pool.  Stored in the `frame_related'
     field and printed as `/f'.

`SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_P (X)'
     Returns a value greater then zero for a `subreg' that has
     `SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P' nonzero if the object being referenced is
     kept zero-extended, zero if it is kept sign-extended, and less
     then zero if it is extended some other way via the `ptr_extend'
     instruction.  Stored in the `unchanging' field and `volatil'
     field, printed as `/u' and `/v'.  This macro may only be used to
     get the value it may not be used to change the value.  Use
     `SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_SET' to change the value.

`SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_SET (X)'
     Set the `unchanging' and `volatil' fields in a `subreg' to reflect
     zero, sign, or other extension.  If `volatil' is zero, then
     `unchanging' as nonzero means zero extension and as zero means
     sign extension. If `volatil' is nonzero then some other type of
     extension was done via the `ptr_extend' instruction.

`SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a `subreg' if it was made when accessing an object that
     was promoted to a wider mode in accord with the `PROMOTED_MODE'
     machine description macro (*note Storage Layout::).  In this case,
     the mode of the `subreg' is the declared mode of the object and
     the mode of `SUBREG_REG' is the mode of the register that holds
     the object.  Promoted variables are always either sign- or
     zero-extended to the wider mode on every assignment.  Stored in
     the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`SYMBOL_REF_USED (X)'
     In a `symbol_ref', indicates that X has been used.  This is
     normally only used to ensure that X is only declared external
     once.  Stored in the `used' field.

`SYMBOL_REF_WEAK (X)'
     In a `symbol_ref', indicates that X has been declared weak.
     Stored in the `integrated' field and printed as `/i'.

`SYMBOL_REF_FLAG (X)'
     In a `symbol_ref', this is used as a flag for machine-specific
     purposes.  Stored in the `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.

     Most uses of `SYMBOL_REF_FLAG' are historic and may be subsumed by
     `SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS'.  Certainly use of `SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS' is
     mandatory if the target requires more than one bit of storage.

   These are the fields to which the above macros refer:

`call'
     In a `mem', 1 means that the memory reference will not trap.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/c'.

`frame_related'
     In an `insn' or `set' expression, 1 means that it is part of a
     function prologue and sets the stack pointer, sets the frame
     pointer, saves a register, or sets up a temporary register to use
     in place of the frame pointer.

     In `reg' expressions, 1 means that the register holds a pointer.

     In `symbol_ref' expressions, 1 means that the reference addresses
     this function's string constant pool.

     In `mem' expressions, 1 means that the reference is to a scalar.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/f'.

`in_struct'
     In `mem' expressions, it is 1 if the memory datum referred to is
     all or part of a structure or array; 0 if it is (or might be) a
     scalar variable.  A reference through a C pointer has 0 because
     the pointer might point to a scalar variable.  This information
     allows the compiler to determine something about possible cases of
     aliasing.

     In `reg' expressions, it is 1 if the register has its entire life
     contained within the test expression of some loop.

     In `subreg' expressions, 1 means that the `subreg' is accessing an
     object that has had its mode promoted from a wider mode.

     In `label_ref' expressions, 1 means that the referenced label is
     outside the innermost loop containing the insn in which the
     `label_ref' was found.

     In `code_label' expressions, it is 1 if the label may never be
     deleted.  This is used for labels which are the target of
     non-local gotos.  Such a label that would have been deleted is
     replaced with a `note' of type `NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL'.

     In an `insn' during dead-code elimination, 1 means that the insn is
     dead code.

     In an `insn' or `jump_insn' during reorg for an insn in the delay
     slot of a branch, 1 means that this insn is from the target of the
     branch.

     In an `insn' during instruction scheduling, 1 means that this insn
     must be scheduled as part of a group together with the previous
     insn.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/s'.

`integrated'
     In an `insn', `insn_list', or `const', 1 means the RTL was
     produced by procedure integration.

     In `reg' expressions, 1 means the register contains the value to
     be returned by the current function.  On machines that pass
     parameters in registers, the same register number may be used for
     parameters as well, but this flag is not set on such uses.

     In `symbol_ref' expressions, 1 means the referenced symbol is weak.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/i'.

`jump'
     In a `mem' expression, 1 means we should keep the alias set for
     this mem unchanged when we access a component.

     In a `set', 1 means it is for a return.

     In a `call_insn', 1 means it is a sibling call.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/j'.

`unchanging'
     In `reg' and `mem' expressions, 1 means that the value of the
     expression never changes.

     In `subreg' expressions, it is 1 if the `subreg' references an
     unsigned object whose mode has been promoted to a wider mode.

     In an `insn' or `jump_insn' in the delay slot of a branch
     instruction, 1 means an annulling branch should be used.

     In a `symbol_ref' expression, 1 means that this symbol addresses
     something in the per-function constant pool.

     In a `call_insn', `note', or an `expr_list' of notes, 1 means that
     this instruction is a call to a const or pure function.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/u'.

`used'
     This flag is used directly (without an access macro) at the end of
     RTL generation for a function, to count the number of times an
     expression appears in insns.  Expressions that appear more than
     once are copied, according to the rules for shared structure
     (*note Sharing::).

     For a `reg', it is used directly (without an access macro) by the
     leaf register renumbering code to ensure that each register is only
     renumbered once.

     In a `symbol_ref', it indicates that an external declaration for
     the symbol has already been written.

`volatil'
     In a `mem', `asm_operands', or `asm_input' expression, it is 1 if
     the memory reference is volatile.  Volatile memory references may
     not be deleted, reordered or combined.

     In a `symbol_ref' expression, it is used for machine-specific
     purposes.

     In a `reg' expression, it is 1 if the value is a user-level
     variable.  0 indicates an internal compiler temporary.

     In an `insn', 1 means the insn has been deleted.

     In `label_ref' and `reg_label' expressions, 1 means a reference to
     a non-local label.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/v'.

9.6 Machine Modes
=================

A machine mode describes a size of data object and the representation
used for it.  In the C code, machine modes are represented by an
enumeration type, `enum machine_mode', defined in `machmode.def'.  Each
RTL expression has room for a machine mode and so do certain kinds of
tree expressions (declarations and types, to be precise).

   In debugging dumps and machine descriptions, the machine mode of an
RTL expression is written after the expression code with a colon to
separate them.  The letters `mode' which appear at the end of each
machine mode name are omitted.  For example, `(reg:SI 38)' is a `reg'
expression with machine mode `SImode'.  If the mode is `VOIDmode', it
is not written at all.

   Here is a table of machine modes.  The term "byte" below refers to an
object of `BITS_PER_UNIT' bits (*note Storage Layout::).

`BImode'
     "Bit" mode represents a single bit, for predicate registers.

`QImode'
     "Quarter-Integer" mode represents a single byte treated as an
     integer.

`HImode'
     "Half-Integer" mode represents a two-byte integer.

`PSImode'
     "Partial Single Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
     four bytes but which doesn't really use all four.  On some
     machines, this is the right mode to use for pointers.

`SImode'
     "Single Integer" mode represents a four-byte integer.

`PDImode'
     "Partial Double Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
     eight bytes but which doesn't really use all eight.  On some
     machines, this is the right mode to use for certain pointers.

`DImode'
     "Double Integer" mode represents an eight-byte integer.

`TImode'
     "Tetra Integer" (?) mode represents a sixteen-byte integer.

`OImode'
     "Octa Integer" (?) mode represents a thirty-two-byte integer.

`QFmode'
     "Quarter-Floating" mode represents a quarter-precision (single
     byte) floating point number.

`HFmode'
     "Half-Floating" mode represents a half-precision (two byte)
     floating point number.

`TQFmode'
     "Three-Quarter-Floating" (?) mode represents a
     three-quarter-precision (three byte) floating point number.

`SFmode'
     "Single Floating" mode represents a four byte floating point
     number.  In the common case, of a processor with IEEE arithmetic
     and 8-bit bytes, this is a single-precision IEEE floating point
     number; it can also be used for double-precision (on processors
     with 16-bit bytes) and single-precision VAX and IBM types.

`DFmode'
     "Double Floating" mode represents an eight byte floating point
     number.  In the common case, of a processor with IEEE arithmetic
     and 8-bit bytes, this is a double-precision IEEE floating point
     number.

`XFmode'
     "Extended Floating" mode represents a twelve byte floating point
     number.  This mode is used for IEEE extended floating point.  On
     some systems not all bits within these bytes will actually be used.

`TFmode'
     "Tetra Floating" mode represents a sixteen byte floating point
     number.  This gets used for both the 96-bit extended IEEE
     floating-point types padded to 128 bits, and true 128-bit extended
     IEEE floating-point types.

`CCmode'
     "Condition Code" mode represents the value of a condition code,
     which is a machine-specific set of bits used to represent the
     result of a comparison operation.  Other machine-specific modes
     may also be used for the condition code.  These modes are not used
     on machines that use `cc0' (see *note Condition Code::).

`BLKmode'
     "Block" mode represents values that are aggregates to which none of
     the other modes apply.  In RTL, only memory references can have
     this mode, and only if they appear in string-move or vector
     instructions.  On machines which have no such instructions,
     `BLKmode' will not appear in RTL.

`VOIDmode'
     Void mode means the absence of a mode or an unspecified mode.  For
     example, RTL expressions of code `const_int' have mode `VOIDmode'
     because they can be taken to have whatever mode the context
     requires.  In debugging dumps of RTL, `VOIDmode' is expressed by
     the absence of any mode.

`QCmode, HCmode, SCmode, DCmode, XCmode, TCmode'
     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
     floating point values.  The floating point values are in `QFmode',
     `HFmode', `SFmode', `DFmode', `XFmode', and `TFmode', respectively.

`CQImode, CHImode, CSImode, CDImode, CTImode, COImode'
     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
     integer values.  The integer values are in `QImode', `HImode',
     `SImode', `DImode', `TImode', and `OImode', respectively.

   The machine description defines `Pmode' as a C macro which expands
into the machine mode used for addresses.  Normally this is the mode
whose size is `BITS_PER_WORD', `SImode' on 32-bit machines.

   The only modes which a machine description must support are
`QImode', and the modes corresponding to `BITS_PER_WORD',
`FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE' and `DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  The compiler will attempt to
use `DImode' for 8-byte structures and unions, but this can be
prevented by overriding the definition of `MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE'.
Alternatively, you can have the compiler use `TImode' for 16-byte
structures and unions.  Likewise, you can arrange for the C type `short
int' to avoid using `HImode'.

   Very few explicit references to machine modes remain in the compiler
and these few references will soon be removed.  Instead, the machine
modes are divided into mode classes.  These are represented by the
enumeration type `enum mode_class' defined in `machmode.h'.  The
possible mode classes are:

`MODE_INT'
     Integer modes.  By default these are `BImode', `QImode', `HImode',
     `SImode', `DImode', `TImode', and `OImode'.

`MODE_PARTIAL_INT'
     The "partial integer" modes, `PQImode', `PHImode', `PSImode' and
     `PDImode'.

`MODE_FLOAT'
     Floating point modes.  By default these are `QFmode', `HFmode',
     `TQFmode', `SFmode', `DFmode', `XFmode' and `TFmode'.

`MODE_COMPLEX_INT'
     Complex integer modes.  (These are not currently implemented).

`MODE_COMPLEX_FLOAT'
     Complex floating point modes.  By default these are `QCmode',
     `HCmode', `SCmode', `DCmode', `XCmode', and `TCmode'.

`MODE_FUNCTION'
     Algol or Pascal function variables including a static chain.
     (These are not currently implemented).

`MODE_CC'
     Modes representing condition code values.  These are `CCmode' plus
     any modes listed in the `EXTRA_CC_MODES' macro.  *Note Jump
     Patterns::, also see *Note Condition Code::.

`MODE_RANDOM'
     This is a catchall mode class for modes which don't fit into the
     above classes.  Currently `VOIDmode' and `BLKmode' are in
     `MODE_RANDOM'.

   Here are some C macros that relate to machine modes:

`GET_MODE (X)'
     Returns the machine mode of the RTX X.

`PUT_MODE (X, NEWMODE)'
     Alters the machine mode of the RTX X to be NEWMODE.

`NUM_MACHINE_MODES'
     Stands for the number of machine modes available on the target
     machine.  This is one greater than the largest numeric value of any
     machine mode.

`GET_MODE_NAME (M)'
     Returns the name of mode M as a string.

`GET_MODE_CLASS (M)'
     Returns the mode class of mode M.

`GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (M)'
     Returns the next wider natural mode.  For example, the expression
     `GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (QImode)' returns `HImode'.

`GET_MODE_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of a datum of mode M.

`GET_MODE_BITSIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bits of a datum of mode M.

`GET_MODE_MASK (M)'
     Returns a bitmask containing 1 for all bits in a word that fit
     within mode M.  This macro can only be used for modes whose
     bitsize is less than or equal to `HOST_BITS_PER_INT'.

`GET_MODE_ALIGNMENT (M)'
     Return the required alignment, in bits, for an object of mode M.

`GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of the subunits of a datum of mode M.
     This is the same as `GET_MODE_SIZE' except in the case of complex
     modes.  For them, the unit size is the size of the real or
     imaginary part.

`GET_MODE_NUNITS (M)'
     Returns the number of units contained in a mode, i.e.,
     `GET_MODE_SIZE' divided by `GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE'.

`GET_CLASS_NARROWEST_MODE (C)'
     Returns the narrowest mode in mode class C.

   The global variables `byte_mode' and `word_mode' contain modes whose
classes are `MODE_INT' and whose bitsizes are either `BITS_PER_UNIT' or
`BITS_PER_WORD', respectively.  On 32-bit machines, these are `QImode'
and `SImode', respectively.

9.7 Constant Expression Types
=============================

The simplest RTL expressions are those that represent constant values.

`(const_int I)'
     This type of expression represents the integer value I.  I is
     customarily accessed with the macro `INTVAL' as in `INTVAL (EXP)',
     which is equivalent to `XWINT (EXP, 0)'.

     There is only one expression object for the integer value zero; it
     is the value of the variable `const0_rtx'.  Likewise, the only
     expression for integer value one is found in `const1_rtx', the only
     expression for integer value two is found in `const2_rtx', and the
     only expression for integer value negative one is found in
     `constm1_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
     `const_int' and value zero, one, two or negative one will return
     `const0_rtx', `const1_rtx', `const2_rtx' or `constm1_rtx' as
     appropriate.

     Similarly, there is only one object for the integer whose value is
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is found in `const_true_rtx'.  If
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is one, `const_true_rtx' and `const1_rtx' will
     point to the same object.  If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is -1,
     `const_true_rtx' and `constm1_rtx' will point to the same object.

`(const_double:M ADDR I0 I1 ...)'
     Represents either a floating-point constant of mode M or an
     integer constant too large to fit into `HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT'
     bits but small enough to fit within twice that number of bits (GCC
     does not provide a mechanism to represent even larger constants).
     In the latter case, M will be `VOIDmode'.

`(const_vector:M [X0 X1 ...])'
     Represents a vector constant.  The square brackets stand for the
     vector containing the constant elements.  X0, X1 and so on are the
     `const_int' or `const_double' elements.

     The number of units in a `const_vector' is obtained with the macro
     `CONST_VECTOR_NUNITS' as in `CONST_VECTOR_NUNITS (V)'.

     Individual elements in a vector constant are accessed with the
     macro `CONST_VECTOR_ELT' as in `CONST_VECTOR_ELT (V, N)' where V
     is the vector constant and N is the element desired.

     ADDR is used to contain the `mem' expression that corresponds to
     the location in memory that at which the constant can be found.  If
     it has not been allocated a memory location, but is on the chain
     of all `const_double' expressions in this compilation (maintained
     using an undisplayed field), ADDR contains `const0_rtx'.  If it is
     not on the chain, ADDR contains `cc0_rtx'.  ADDR is customarily
     accessed with the macro `CONST_DOUBLE_MEM' and the chain field via
     `CONST_DOUBLE_CHAIN'.

     If M is `VOIDmode', the bits of the value are stored in I0 and I1.
     I0 is customarily accessed with the macro `CONST_DOUBLE_LOW' and
     I1 with `CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH'.

     If the constant is floating point (regardless of its precision),
     then the number of integers used to store the value depends on the
     size of `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' (*note Floating Point::).  The integers
     represent a floating point number, but not precisely in the target
     machine's or host machine's floating point format.  To convert
     them to the precise bit pattern used by the target machine, use
     the macro `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' and friends (*note Data
     Output::).

     The macro `CONST0_RTX (MODE)' refers to an expression with value 0
     in mode MODE.  If mode MODE is of mode class `MODE_INT', it
     returns `const0_rtx'.  If mode MODE is of mode class `MODE_FLOAT',
     it returns a `CONST_DOUBLE' expression in mode MODE.  Otherwise,
     it returns a `CONST_VECTOR' expression in mode MODE.  Similarly,
     the macro `CONST1_RTX (MODE)' refers to an expression with value 1
     in mode MODE and similarly for `CONST2_RTX'.  The `CONST1_RTX' and
     `CONST2_RTX' macros are undefined for vector modes.

`(const_string STR)'
     Represents a constant string with value STR.  Currently this is
     used only for insn attributes (*note Insn Attributes::) since
     constant strings in C are placed in memory.

`(symbol_ref:MODE SYMBOL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for data.  SYMBOL is a
     string that describes the name of the assembler label.  If it
     starts with a `*', the label is the rest of SYMBOL not including
     the `*'.  Otherwise, the label is SYMBOL, usually prefixed with
     `_'.

     The `symbol_ref' contains a mode, which is usually `Pmode'.
     Usually that is the only mode for which a symbol is directly valid.

`(label_ref LABEL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for code.  It contains
     one operand, an expression, which must be a `code_label' or a
     `note' of type `NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL' that appears in the
     instruction sequence to identify the place where the label should
     go.

     The reason for using a distinct expression type for code label
     references is so that jump optimization can distinguish them.

`(const:M EXP)'
     Represents a constant that is the result of an assembly-time
     arithmetic computation.  The operand, EXP, is an expression that
     contains only constants (`const_int', `symbol_ref' and `label_ref'
     expressions) combined with `plus' and `minus'.  However, not all
     combinations are valid, since the assembler cannot do arbitrary
     arithmetic on relocatable symbols.

     M should be `Pmode'.

`(high:M EXP)'
     Represents the high-order bits of EXP, usually a `symbol_ref'.
     The number of bits is machine-dependent and is normally the number
     of bits specified in an instruction that initializes the high
     order bits of a register.  It is used with `lo_sum' to represent
     the typical two-instruction sequence used in RISC machines to
     reference a global memory location.

     M should be `Pmode'.

9.8 Registers and Memory
========================

Here are the RTL expression types for describing access to machine
registers and to main memory.

`(reg:M N)'
     For small values of the integer N (those that are less than
     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'), this stands for a reference to machine
     register number N: a "hard register".  For larger values of N, it
     stands for a temporary value or "pseudo register".  The compiler's
     strategy is to generate code assuming an unlimited number of such
     pseudo registers, and later convert them into hard registers or
     into memory references.

     M is the machine mode of the reference.  It is necessary because
     machines can generally refer to each register in more than one
     mode.  For example, a register may contain a full word but there
     may be instructions to refer to it as a half word or as a single
     byte, as well as instructions to refer to it as a floating point
     number of various precisions.

     Even for a register that the machine can access in only one mode,
     the mode must always be specified.

     The symbol `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER' is defined by the machine
     description, since the number of hard registers on the machine is
     an invariant characteristic of the machine.  Note, however, that
     not all of the machine registers must be general registers.  All
     the machine registers that can be used for storage of data are
     given hard register numbers, even those that can be used only in
     certain instructions or can hold only certain types of data.

     A hard register may be accessed in various modes throughout one
     function, but each pseudo register is given a natural mode and is
     accessed only in that mode.  When it is necessary to describe an
     access to a pseudo register using a nonnatural mode, a `subreg'
     expression is used.

     A `reg' expression with a machine mode that specifies more than
     one word of data may actually stand for several consecutive
     registers.  If in addition the register number specifies a
     hardware register, then it actually represents several consecutive
     hardware registers starting with the specified one.

     Each pseudo register number used in a function's RTL code is
     represented by a unique `reg' expression.

     Some pseudo register numbers, those within the range of
     `FIRST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' to `LAST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' only appear
     during the RTL generation phase and are eliminated before the
     optimization phases.  These represent locations in the stack frame
     that cannot be determined until RTL generation for the function
     has been completed.  The following virtual register numbers are
     defined:

    `VIRTUAL_INCOMING_ARGS_REGNUM'
          This points to the first word of the incoming arguments
          passed on the stack.  Normally these arguments are placed
          there by the caller, but the callee may have pushed some
          arguments that were previously passed in registers.

          When RTL generation is complete, this virtual register is
          replaced by the sum of the register given by
          `ARG_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value of `FIRST_PARM_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM'
          If `FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined, this points to
          immediately above the first variable on the stack.
          Otherwise, it points to the first variable on the stack.

          `VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM' is replaced with the sum of the
          register given by `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_STACK_DYNAMIC_REGNUM'
          This points to the location of dynamically allocated memory
          on the stack immediately after the stack pointer has been
          adjusted by the amount of memory desired.

          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
          given by `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_OUTGOING_ARGS_REGNUM'
          This points to the location in the stack at which outgoing
          arguments should be written when the stack is pre-pushed
          (arguments pushed using push insns should always use
          `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM').

          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
          given by `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STACK_POINTER_OFFSET'.

`(subreg:M REG BYTENUM)'
     `subreg' expressions are used to refer to a register in a machine
     mode other than its natural one, or to refer to one register of a
     multi-part `reg' that actually refers to several registers.

     Each pseudo-register has a natural mode.  If it is necessary to
     operate on it in a different mode--for example, to perform a
     fullword move instruction on a pseudo-register that contains a
     single byte--the pseudo-register must be enclosed in a `subreg'.
     In such a case, BYTENUM is zero.

     Usually M is at least as narrow as the mode of REG, in which case
     it is restricting consideration to only the bits of REG that are
     in M.

     Sometimes M is wider than the mode of REG.  These `subreg'
     expressions are often called "paradoxical".  They are used in
     cases where we want to refer to an object in a wider mode but do
     not care what value the additional bits have.  The reload pass
     ensures that paradoxical references are only made to hard
     registers.

     The other use of `subreg' is to extract the individual registers of
     a multi-register value.  Machine modes such as `DImode' and
     `TImode' can indicate values longer than a word, values which
     usually require two or more consecutive registers.  To access one
     of the registers, use a `subreg' with mode `SImode' and a BYTENUM
     offset that says which register.

     Storing in a non-paradoxical `subreg' has undefined results for
     bits belonging to the same word as the `subreg'.  This laxity makes
     it easier to generate efficient code for such instructions.  To
     represent an instruction that preserves all the bits outside of
     those in the `subreg', use `strict_low_part' around the `subreg'.

     The compilation parameter `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN', if set to 1, says
     that byte number zero is part of the most significant word;
     otherwise, it is part of the least significant word.

     The compilation parameter `BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN', if set to 1, says
     that byte number zero is the most significant byte within a word;
     otherwise, it is the least significant byte within a word.

     On a few targets, `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' disagrees with
     `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.  However, most parts of the compiler treat
     floating point values as if they had the same endianness as
     integer values.  This works because they handle them solely as a
     collection of integer values, with no particular numerical value.
     Only real.c and the runtime libraries care about
     `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.

     Between the combiner pass and the reload pass, it is possible to
     have a paradoxical `subreg' which contains a `mem' instead of a
     `reg' as its first operand.  After the reload pass, it is also
     possible to have a non-paradoxical `subreg' which contains a
     `mem'; this usually occurs when the `mem' is a stack slot which
     replaced a pseudo register.

     Note that it is not valid to access a `DFmode' value in `SFmode'
     using a `subreg'.  On some machines the most significant part of a
     `DFmode' value does not have the same format as a single-precision
     floating value.

     It is also not valid to access a single word of a multi-word value
     in a hard register when less registers can hold the value than
     would be expected from its size.  For example, some 32-bit
     machines have floating-point registers that can hold an entire
     `DFmode' value.  If register 10 were such a register `(subreg:SI
     (reg:DF 10) 1)' would be invalid because there is no way to
     convert that reference to a single machine register.  The reload
     pass prevents `subreg' expressions such as these from being formed.

     The first operand of a `subreg' expression is customarily accessed
     with the `SUBREG_REG' macro and the second operand is customarily
     accessed with the `SUBREG_BYTE' macro.

`(scratch:M)'
     This represents a scratch register that will be required for the
     execution of a single instruction and not used subsequently.  It is
     converted into a `reg' by either the local register allocator or
     the reload pass.

     `scratch' is usually present inside a `clobber' operation (*note
     Side Effects::).

`(cc0)'
     This refers to the machine's condition code register.  It has no
     operands and may not have a machine mode.  There are two ways to
     use it:

        * To stand for a complete set of condition code flags.  This is
          best on most machines, where each comparison sets the entire
          series of flags.

          With this technique, `(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
          compare instructions) and in comparison operators comparing
          against zero (`const_int' with value zero; that is to say,
          `const0_rtx').

        * To stand for a single flag that is the result of a single
          condition.  This is useful on machines that have only a
          single flag bit, and in which comparison instructions must
          specify the condition to test.

          With this technique, `(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
          compare instructions) where the source is a comparison
          operator, and as the first operand of `if_then_else' (in a
          conditional branch).

     There is only one expression object of code `cc0'; it is the value
     of the variable `cc0_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
     code `cc0' will return `cc0_rtx'.

     Instructions can set the condition code implicitly.  On many
     machines, nearly all instructions set the condition code based on
     the value that they compute or store.  It is not necessary to
     record these actions explicitly in the RTL because the machine
     description includes a prescription for recognizing the
     instructions that do so (by means of the macro
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC').  *Note Condition Code::.  Only instructions
     whose sole purpose is to set the condition code, and instructions
     that use the condition code, need mention `(cc0)'.

     On some machines, the condition code register is given a register
     number and a `reg' is used instead of `(cc0)'.  This is usually the
     preferable approach if only a small subset of instructions modify
     the condition code.  Other machines store condition codes in
     general registers; in such cases a pseudo register should be used.

     Some machines, such as the SPARC and RS/6000, have two sets of
     arithmetic instructions, one that sets and one that does not set
     the condition code.  This is best handled by normally generating
     the instruction that does not set the condition code, and making a
     pattern that both performs the arithmetic and sets the condition
     code register (which would not be `(cc0)' in this case).  For
     examples, search for `addcc' and `andcc' in `sparc.md'.

`(pc)'
     This represents the machine's program counter.  It has no operands
     and may not have a machine mode.  `(pc)' may be validly used only
     in certain specific contexts in jump instructions.

     There is only one expression object of code `pc'; it is the value
     of the variable `pc_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
     code `pc' will return `pc_rtx'.

     All instructions that do not jump alter the program counter
     implicitly by incrementing it, but there is no need to mention
     this in the RTL.

`(mem:M ADDR ALIAS)'
     This RTX represents a reference to main memory at an address
     represented by the expression ADDR.  M specifies how large a unit
     of memory is accessed.  ALIAS specifies an alias set for the
     reference.  In general two items are in different alias sets if
     they cannot reference the same memory address.

     The construct `(mem:BLK (scratch))' is considered to alias all
     other memories.  Thus it may be used as a memory barrier in
     epilogue stack deallocation patterns.

`(addressof:M REG)'
     This RTX represents a request for the address of register REG.
     Its mode is always `Pmode'.  If there are any `addressof'
     expressions left in the function after CSE, REG is forced into the
     stack and the `addressof' expression is replaced with a `plus'
     expression for the address of its stack slot.

9.9 RTL Expressions for Arithmetic
==================================

Unless otherwise specified, all the operands of arithmetic expressions
must be valid for mode M.  An operand is valid for mode M if it has
mode M, or if it is a `const_int' or `const_double' and M is a mode of
class `MODE_INT'.

   For commutative binary operations, constants should be placed in the
second operand.

`(plus:M X Y)'
     Represents the sum of the values represented by X and Y carried
     out in machine mode M.

`(lo_sum:M X Y)'
     Like `plus', except that it represents that sum of X and the
     low-order bits of Y.  The number of low order bits is
     machine-dependent but is normally the number of bits in a `Pmode'
     item minus the number of bits set by the `high' code (*note
     Constants::).

     M should be `Pmode'.

`(minus:M X Y)'
     Like `plus' but represents subtraction.

`(ss_plus:M X Y)'
     Like `plus', but using signed saturation in case of an overflow.

`(us_plus:M X Y)'
     Like `plus', but using unsigned saturation in case of an overflow.

`(ss_minus:M X Y)'
     Like `minus', but using signed saturation in case of an overflow.

`(us_minus:M X Y)'
     Like `minus', but using unsigned saturation in case of an overflow.

`(compare:M X Y)'
     Represents the result of subtracting Y from X for purposes of
     comparison.  The result is computed without overflow, as if with
     infinite precision.

     Of course, machines can't really subtract with infinite precision.
     However, they can pretend to do so when only the sign of the
     result will be used, which is the case when the result is stored
     in the condition code.  And that is the _only_ way this kind of
     expression may validly be used: as a value to be stored in the
     condition codes, either `(cc0)' or a register.  *Note
     Comparisons::.

     The mode M is not related to the modes of X and Y, but instead is
     the mode of the condition code value.  If `(cc0)' is used, it is
     `VOIDmode'.  Otherwise it is some mode in class `MODE_CC', often
     `CCmode'.  *Note Condition Code::.  If M is `VOIDmode' or
     `CCmode', the operation returns sufficient information (in an
     unspecified format) so that any comparison operator can be applied
     to the result of the `COMPARE' operation.  For other modes in
     class `MODE_CC', the operation only returns a subset of this
     information.

     Normally, X and Y must have the same mode.  Otherwise, `compare'
     is valid only if the mode of X is in class `MODE_INT' and Y is a
     `const_int' or `const_double' with mode `VOIDmode'.  The mode of X
     determines what mode the comparison is to be done in; thus it must
     not be `VOIDmode'.

     If one of the operands is a constant, it should be placed in the
     second operand and the comparison code adjusted as appropriate.

     A `compare' specifying two `VOIDmode' constants is not valid since
     there is no way to know in what mode the comparison is to be
     performed; the comparison must either be folded during the
     compilation or the first operand must be loaded into a register
     while its mode is still known.

`(neg:M X)'
     Represents the negation (subtraction from zero) of the value
     represented by X, carried out in mode M.

`(mult:M X Y)'
     Represents the signed product of the values represented by X and Y
     carried out in machine mode M.

     Some machines support a multiplication that generates a product
     wider than the operands.  Write the pattern for this as

          (mult:M (sign_extend:M X) (sign_extend:M Y))

     where M is wider than the modes of X and Y, which need not be the
     same.

     For unsigned widening multiplication, use the same idiom, but with
     `zero_extend' instead of `sign_extend'.

`(div:M X Y)'
     Represents the quotient in signed division of X by Y, carried out
     in machine mode M.  If M is a floating point mode, it represents
     the exact quotient; otherwise, the integerized quotient.

     Some machines have division instructions in which the operands and
     quotient widths are not all the same; you should represent such
     instructions using `truncate' and `sign_extend' as in,

          (truncate:M1 (div:M2 X (sign_extend:M2 Y)))

`(udiv:M X Y)'
     Like `div' but represents unsigned division.

`(mod:M X Y)'
`(umod:M X Y)'
     Like `div' and `udiv' but represent the remainder instead of the
     quotient.

`(smin:M X Y)'
`(smax:M X Y)'
     Represents the smaller (for `smin') or larger (for `smax') of X
     and Y, interpreted as signed integers in mode M.

`(umin:M X Y)'
`(umax:M X Y)'
     Like `smin' and `smax', but the values are interpreted as unsigned
     integers.

`(not:M X)'
     Represents the bitwise complement of the value represented by X,
     carried out in mode M, which must be a fixed-point machine mode.

`(and:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise logical-and of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     machine mode.

`(ior:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise inclusive-or of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     mode.

`(xor:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise exclusive-or of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     mode.

`(ashift:M X C)'
     Represents the result of arithmetically shifting X left by C
     places.  X have mode M, a fixed-point machine mode.  C be a
     fixed-point mode or be a constant with mode `VOIDmode'; which mode
     is determined by the mode called for in the machine description
     entry for the left-shift instruction.  For example, on the VAX,
     the mode of C is `QImode' regardless of M.

`(lshiftrt:M X C)'
`(ashiftrt:M X C)'
     Like `ashift' but for right shift.  Unlike the case for left shift,
     these two operations are distinct.

`(rotate:M X C)'
`(rotatert:M X C)'
     Similar but represent left and right rotate.  If C is a constant,
     use `rotate'.

`(abs:M X)'
     Represents the absolute value of X, computed in mode M.

`(sqrt:M X)'
     Represents the square root of X, computed in mode M.  Most often M
     will be a floating point mode.

`(ffs:M X)'
     Represents one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit in X,
     represented as an integer of mode M.  (The value is zero if X is
     zero.)  The mode of X need not be M; depending on the target
     machine, various mode combinations may be valid.

`(clz:M X)'
     Represents the number of leading 0-bits in X, represented as an
     integer of mode M, starting at the most significant bit position.
     If X is zero, the value is determined by
     `CLZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO'.  Note that this is one of the few
     expressions that is not invariant under widening.  The mode of X
     will usually be an integer mode.

`(ctz:M X)'
     Represents the number of trailing 0-bits in X, represented as an
     integer of mode M, starting at the least significant bit position.
     If X is zero, the value is determined by
     `CTZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO'.  Except for this case, `ctz(x)' is
     equivalent to `ffs(X) - 1'.  The mode of X will usually be an
     integer mode.

`(popcount:M X)'
     Represents the number of 1-bits in X, represented as an integer of
     mode M.  The mode of X will usually be an integer mode.

`(parity:M X)'
     Represents the number of 1-bits modulo 2 in X, represented as an
     integer of mode M.  The mode of X will usually be an integer mode.

9.10 Comparison Operations
==========================

Comparison operators test a relation on two operands and are considered
to represent a machine-dependent nonzero value described by, but not
necessarily equal to, `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::) if the relation
holds, or zero if it does not, for comparison operators whose results
have a `MODE_INT' mode, and `FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::) if
the relation holds, or zero if it does not, for comparison operators
that return floating-point values.  The mode of the comparison
operation is independent of the mode of the data being compared.  If
the comparison operation is being tested (e.g., the first operand of an
`if_then_else'), the mode must be `VOIDmode'.

   There are two ways that comparison operations may be used.  The
comparison operators may be used to compare the condition codes `(cc0)'
against zero, as in `(eq (cc0) (const_int 0))'.  Such a construct
actually refers to the result of the preceding instruction in which the
condition codes were set.  The instruction setting the condition code
must be adjacent to the instruction using the condition code; only
`note' insns may separate them.

   Alternatively, a comparison operation may directly compare two data
objects.  The mode of the comparison is determined by the operands; they
must both be valid for a common machine mode.  A comparison with both
operands constant would be invalid as the machine mode could not be
deduced from it, but such a comparison should never exist in RTL due to
constant folding.

   In the example above, if `(cc0)' were last set to `(compare X Y)',
the comparison operation is identical to `(eq X Y)'.  Usually only one
style of comparisons is supported on a particular machine, but the
combine pass will try to merge the operations to produce the `eq' shown
in case it exists in the context of the particular insn involved.

   Inequality comparisons come in two flavors, signed and unsigned.
Thus, there are distinct expression codes `gt' and `gtu' for signed and
unsigned greater-than.  These can produce different results for the same
pair of integer values: for example, 1 is signed greater-than -1 but not
unsigned greater-than, because -1 when regarded as unsigned is actually
`0xffffffff' which is greater than 1.

   The signed comparisons are also used for floating point values.
Floating point comparisons are distinguished by the machine modes of
the operands.

`(eq:M X Y)'
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the values represented by X and Y are equal,
     otherwise 0.

`(ne:M X Y)'
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the values represented by X and Y are not
     equal, otherwise 0.

`(gt:M X Y)'
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the X is greater than Y.  If they are
     fixed-point, the comparison is done in a signed sense.

`(gtu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' but does unsigned comparison, on fixed-point numbers
     only.

`(lt:M X Y)'
`(ltu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "less than".

`(ge:M X Y)'
`(geu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "greater than or equal".

`(le:M X Y)'
`(leu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "less than or equal".

`(if_then_else COND THEN ELSE)'
     This is not a comparison operation but is listed here because it is
     always used in conjunction with a comparison operation.  To be
     precise, COND is a comparison expression.  This expression
     represents a choice, according to COND, between the value
     represented by THEN and the one represented by ELSE.

     On most machines, `if_then_else' expressions are valid only to
     express conditional jumps.

`(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 TEST2 VALUE2 ...] DEFAULT)'
     Similar to `if_then_else', but more general.  Each of TEST1,
     TEST2, ... is performed in turn.  The result of this expression is
     the VALUE corresponding to the first nonzero test, or DEFAULT if
     none of the tests are nonzero expressions.

     This is currently not valid for instruction patterns and is
     supported only for insn attributes.  *Note Insn Attributes::.

9.11 Bit-Fields
===============

Special expression codes exist to represent bit-field instructions.
These types of expressions are lvalues in RTL; they may appear on the
left side of an assignment, indicating insertion of a value into the
specified bit-field.

`(sign_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
     This represents a reference to a sign-extended bit-field contained
     or starting in LOC (a memory or register reference).  The bit-field
     is SIZE bits wide and starts at bit POS.  The compilation option
     `BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' says which end of the memory unit POS counts
     from.

     If LOC is in memory, its mode must be a single-byte integer mode.
     If LOC is in a register, the mode to use is specified by the
     operand of the `insv' or `extv' pattern (*note Standard Names::)
     and is usually a full-word integer mode, which is the default if
     none is specified.

     The mode of POS is machine-specific and is also specified in the
     `insv' or `extv' pattern.

     The mode M is the same as the mode that would be used for LOC if
     it were a register.

`(zero_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
     Like `sign_extract' but refers to an unsigned or zero-extended
     bit-field.  The same sequence of bits are extracted, but they are
     filled to an entire word with zeros instead of by sign-extension.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Vector Operations,  Next: Conversions,  Prev: Bit-Fields,  Up: RTL

9.12 Vector Operations
======================

All normal RTL expressions can be used with vector modes; they are
interpreted as operating on each part of the vector independently.
Additionally, there are a few new expressions to describe specific
vector operations.

`(vec_merge:M VEC1 VEC2 ITEMS)'
     This describes a merge operation between two vectors.  The result
     is a vector of mode M; its elements are selected from either VEC1
     or VEC2.  Which elements are selected is described by ITEMS, which
     is a bit mask represented by a `const_int'; a zero bit indicates
     the corresponding element in the result vector is taken from VEC2
     while a set bit indicates it is taken from VEC1.

`(vec_select:M VEC1 SELECTION)'
     This describes an operation that selects parts of a vector.  VEC1
     is the source vector, SELECTION is a `parallel' that contains a
     `const_int' for each of the subparts of the result vector, giving
     the number of the source subpart that should be stored into it.

`(vec_concat:M VEC1 VEC2)'
     Describes a vector concat operation.  The result is a
     concatenation of the vectors VEC1 and VEC2; its length is the sum
     of the lengths of the two inputs.

`(vec_duplicate:M VEC)'
     This operation converts a small vector into a larger one by
     duplicating the input values.  The output vector mode must have
     the same submodes as the input vector mode, and the number of
     output parts must be an integer multiple of the number of input
     parts.



File: gccint.info,  Node: Conversions,  Next: RTL Declarations,  Prev: Vector Operations,  Up: RTL

9.13 Conversions
================

All conversions between machine modes must be represented by explicit
conversion operations.  For example, an expression which is the sum of
a byte and a full word cannot be written as `(plus:SI (reg:QI 34)
(reg:SI 80))' because the `plus' operation requires two operands of the
same machine mode.  Therefore, the byte-sized operand is enclosed in a
conversion operation, as in

     (plus:SI (sign_extend:SI (reg:QI 34)) (reg:SI 80))

   The conversion operation is not a mere placeholder, because there
may be more than one way of converting from a given starting mode to
the desired final mode.  The conversion operation code says how to do
it.

   For all conversion operations, X must not be `VOIDmode' because the
mode in which to do the conversion would not be known.  The conversion
must either be done at compile-time or X must be placed into a register.

`(sign_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of sign-extending the value X to machine
     mode M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of
     a mode narrower than M.

`(zero_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of zero-extending the value X to machine
     mode M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of
     a mode narrower than M.

`(float_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of extending the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
     mode narrower than M.

`(truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a mode
     wider than M.

`(ss_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M,
     using signed saturation in the case of overflow.  Both M and the
     mode of X must be fixed-point modes.

`(us_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M,
     using unsigned saturation in the case of overflow.  Both M and the
     mode of X must be fixed-point modes.

`(float_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
     mode wider than M.

`(float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
     as signed, to floating point mode M.

`(unsigned_float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
     as unsigned, to floating point mode M.

`(fix:M X)'
     When M is a fixed point mode, represents the result of converting
     floating point value X to mode M, regarded as signed.  How
     rounding is done is not specified, so this operation may be used
     validly in compiling C code only for integer-valued operands.

`(unsigned_fix:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting floating point value X to
     fixed point mode M, regarded as unsigned.  How rounding is done is
     not specified.

`(fix:M X)'
     When M is a floating point mode, represents the result of
     converting floating point value X (valid for mode M) to an
     integer, still represented in floating point mode M, by rounding
     towards zero.


File: gccint.info,  Node: RTL Declarations,  Next: Side Effects,  Prev: Conversions,  Up: RTL

9.14 Declarations
=================

Declaration expression codes do not represent arithmetic operations but
rather state assertions about their operands.

`(strict_low_part (subreg:M (reg:N R) 0))'
     This expression code is used in only one context: as the
     destination operand of a `set' expression.  In addition, the
     operand of this expression must be a non-paradoxical `subreg'
     expression.

     The presence of `strict_low_part' says that the part of the
     register which is meaningful in mode N, but is not part of mode M,
     is not to be altered.  Normally, an assignment to such a subreg is
     allowed to have undefined effects on the rest of the register when
     M is less than a word.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Side Effects,  Next: Incdec,  Prev: RTL Declarations,  Up: RTL

9.15 Side Effect Expressions
============================

The expression codes described so far represent values, not actions.
But machine instructions never produce values; they are meaningful only
for their side effects on the state of the machine.  Special expression
codes are used to represent side effects.

   The body of an instruction is always one of these side effect codes;
the codes described above, which represent values, appear only as the
operands of these.

`(set LVAL X)'
     Represents the action of storing the value of X into the place
     represented by LVAL.  LVAL must be an expression representing a
     place that can be stored in: `reg' (or `subreg', `strict_low_part'
     or `zero_extract'), `mem', `pc', `parallel', or `cc0'.

     If LVAL is a `reg', `subreg' or `mem', it has a machine mode; then
     X must be valid for that mode.

     If LVAL is a `reg' whose machine mode is less than the full width
     of the register, then it means that the part of the register
     specified by the machine mode is given the specified value and the
     rest of the register receives an undefined value.  Likewise, if
     LVAL is a `subreg' whose machine mode is narrower than the mode of
     the register, the rest of the register can be changed in an
     undefined way.

     If LVAL is a `strict_low_part' or `zero_extract' of a `subreg',
     then the part of the register specified by the machine mode of the
     `subreg' is given the value X and the rest of the register is not
     changed.

     If LVAL is `(cc0)', it has no machine mode, and X may be either a
     `compare' expression or a value that may have any mode.  The
     latter case represents a "test" instruction.  The expression `(set
     (cc0) (reg:M N))' is equivalent to `(set (cc0) (compare (reg:M N)
     (const_int 0)))'.  Use the former expression to save space during
     the compilation.

     If LVAL is a `parallel', it is used to represent the case of a
     function returning a structure in multiple registers.  Each element
     of the `parallel' is an `expr_list' whose first operand is a `reg'
     and whose second operand is a `const_int' representing the offset
     (in bytes) into the structure at which the data in that register
     corresponds.  The first element may be null to indicate that the
     structure is also passed partly in memory.

     If LVAL is `(pc)', we have a jump instruction, and the
     possibilities for X are very limited.  It may be a `label_ref'
     expression (unconditional jump).  It may be an `if_then_else'
     (conditional jump), in which case either the second or the third
     operand must be `(pc)' (for the case which does not jump) and the
     other of the two must be a `label_ref' (for the case which does
     jump).  X may also be a `mem' or `(plus:SI (pc) Y)', where Y may
     be a `reg' or a `mem'; these unusual patterns are used to
     represent jumps through branch tables.

     If LVAL is neither `(cc0)' nor `(pc)', the mode of LVAL must not
     be `VOIDmode' and the mode of X must be valid for the mode of LVAL.

     LVAL is customarily accessed with the `SET_DEST' macro and X with
     the `SET_SRC' macro.

`(return)'
     As the sole expression in a pattern, represents a return from the
     current function, on machines where this can be done with one
     instruction, such as VAXen.  On machines where a multi-instruction
     "epilogue" must be executed in order to return from the function,
     returning is done by jumping to a label which precedes the
     epilogue, and the `return' expression code is never used.

     Inside an `if_then_else' expression, represents the value to be
     placed in `pc' to return to the caller.

     Note that an insn pattern of `(return)' is logically equivalent to
     `(set (pc) (return))', but the latter form is never used.

`(call FUNCTION NARGS)'
     Represents a function call.  FUNCTION is a `mem' expression whose
     address is the address of the function to be called.  NARGS is an
     expression which can be used for two purposes: on some machines it
     represents the number of bytes of stack argument; on others, it
     represents the number of argument registers.

     Each machine has a standard machine mode which FUNCTION must have.
     The machine description defines macro `FUNCTION_MODE' to expand
     into the requisite mode name.  The purpose of this mode is to
     specify what kind of addressing is allowed, on machines where the
     allowed kinds of addressing depend on the machine mode being
     addressed.

`(clobber X)'
     Represents the storing or possible storing of an unpredictable,
     undescribed value into X, which must be a `reg', `scratch',
     `parallel' or `mem' expression.

     One place this is used is in string instructions that store
     standard values into particular hard registers.  It may not be
     worth the trouble to describe the values that are stored, but it
     is essential to inform the compiler that the registers will be
     altered, lest it attempt to keep data in them across the string
     instruction.

     If X is `(mem:BLK (const_int 0))' or `(mem:BLK (scratch))', it
     means that all memory locations must be presumed clobbered.  If X
     is a `parallel', it has the same meaning as a `parallel' in a
     `set' expression.

     Note that the machine description classifies certain hard
     registers as "call-clobbered".  All function call instructions are
     assumed by default to clobber these registers, so there is no need
     to use `clobber' expressions to indicate this fact.  Also, each
     function call is assumed to have the potential to alter any memory
     location, unless the function is declared `const'.

     If the last group of expressions in a `parallel' are each a
     `clobber' expression whose arguments are `reg' or `match_scratch'
     (*note RTL Template::) expressions, the combiner phase can add the
     appropriate `clobber' expressions to an insn it has constructed
     when doing so will cause a pattern to be matched.

     This feature can be used, for example, on a machine that whose
     multiply and add instructions don't use an MQ register but which
     has an add-accumulate instruction that does clobber the MQ
     register.  Similarly, a combined instruction might require a
     temporary register while the constituent instructions might not.

     When a `clobber' expression for a register appears inside a
     `parallel' with other side effects, the register allocator
     guarantees that the register is unoccupied both before and after
     that insn.  However, the reload phase may allocate a register used
     for one of the inputs unless the `&' constraint is specified for
     the selected alternative (*note Modifiers::).  You can clobber
     either a specific hard register, a pseudo register, or a `scratch'
     expression; in the latter two cases, GCC will allocate a hard
     register that is available there for use as a temporary.

     For instructions that require a temporary register, you should use
     `scratch' instead of a pseudo-register because this will allow the
     combiner phase to add the `clobber' when required.  You do this by
     coding (`clobber' (`match_scratch' ...)).  If you do clobber a
     pseudo register, use one which appears nowhere else--generate a
     new one each time.  Otherwise, you may confuse CSE.

     There is one other known use for clobbering a pseudo register in a
     `parallel': when one of the input operands of the insn is also
     clobbered by the insn.  In this case, using the same pseudo
     register in the clobber and elsewhere in the insn produces the
     expected results.

`(use X)'
     Represents the use of the value of X.  It indicates that the value
     in X at this point in the program is needed, even though it may
     not be apparent why this is so.  Therefore, the compiler will not
     attempt to delete previous instructions whose only effect is to
     store a value in X.  X must be a `reg' expression.

     In some situations, it may be tempting to add a `use' of a
     register in a `parallel' to describe a situation where the value
     of a special register will modify the behavior of the instruction.
     An hypothetical example might be a pattern for an addition that can
     either wrap around or use saturating addition depending on the
     value of a special control register:

          (parallel [(set (reg:SI 2) (unspec:SI [(reg:SI 3)
                                                 (reg:SI 4)] 0))
                     (use (reg:SI 1))])

     This will not work, several of the optimizers only look at
     expressions locally; it is very likely that if you have multiple
     insns with identical inputs to the `unspec', they will be
     optimized away even if register 1 changes in between.

     This means that `use' can _only_ be used to describe that the
     register is live.  You should think twice before adding `use'
     statements, more often you will want to use `unspec' instead.  The
     `use' RTX is most commonly useful to describe that a fixed
     register is implicitly used in an insn.  It is also safe to use in
     patterns where the compiler knows for other reasons that the result
     of the whole pattern is variable, such as `movstrM' or `call'
     patterns.

     During the reload phase, an insn that has a `use' as pattern can
     carry a reg_equal note.  These `use' insns will be deleted before
     the reload phase exits.

     During the delayed branch scheduling phase, X may be an insn.
     This indicates that X previously was located at this place in the
     code and its data dependencies need to be taken into account.
     These `use' insns will be deleted before the delayed branch
     scheduling phase exits.

`(parallel [X0 X1 ...])'
     Represents several side effects performed in parallel.  The square
     brackets stand for a vector; the operand of `parallel' is a vector
     of expressions.  X0, X1 and so on are individual side effect
     expressions--expressions of code `set', `call', `return',
     `clobber' or `use'.

     "In parallel" means that first all the values used in the
     individual side-effects are computed, and second all the actual
     side-effects are performed.  For example,

          (parallel [(set (reg:SI 1) (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)))
                     (set (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)) (reg:SI 1))])

     says unambiguously that the values of hard register 1 and the
     memory location addressed by it are interchanged.  In both places
     where `(reg:SI 1)' appears as a memory address it refers to the
     value in register 1 _before_ the execution of the insn.

     It follows that it is _incorrect_ to use `parallel' and expect the
     result of one `set' to be available for the next one.  For
     example, people sometimes attempt to represent a jump-if-zero
     instruction this way:

          (parallel [(set (cc0) (reg:SI 34))
                     (set (pc) (if_then_else
                                  (eq (cc0) (const_int 0))
                                  (label_ref ...)
                                  (pc)))])

     But this is incorrect, because it says that the jump condition
     depends on the condition code value _before_ this instruction, not
     on the new value that is set by this instruction.

     Peephole optimization, which takes place together with final
     assembly code output, can produce insns whose patterns consist of
     a `parallel' whose elements are the operands needed to output the
     resulting assembler code--often `reg', `mem' or constant
     expressions.  This would not be well-formed RTL at any other stage
     in compilation, but it is ok then because no further optimization
     remains to be done.  However, the definition of the macro
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC', if any, must deal with such insns if you
     define any peephole optimizations.

`(cond_exec [COND EXPR])'
     Represents a conditionally executed expression.  The EXPR is
     executed only if the COND is nonzero.  The COND expression must
     not have side-effects, but the EXPR may very well have
     side-effects.

`(sequence [INSNS ...])'
     Represents a sequence of insns.  Each of the INSNS that appears in
     the vector is suitable for appearing in the chain of insns, so it
     must be an `insn', `jump_insn', `call_insn', `code_label',
     `barrier' or `note'.

     A `sequence' RTX is never placed in an actual insn during RTL
     generation.  It represents the sequence of insns that result from a
     `define_expand' _before_ those insns are passed to `emit_insn' to
     insert them in the chain of insns.  When actually inserted, the
     individual sub-insns are separated out and the `sequence' is
     forgotten.

     After delay-slot scheduling is completed, an insn and all the
     insns that reside in its delay slots are grouped together into a
     `sequence'.  The insn requiring the delay slot is the first insn
     in the vector; subsequent insns are to be placed in the delay slot.

     `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' is set on an insn in a delay slot to
     indicate that a branch insn should be used that will conditionally
     annul the effect of the insns in the delay slots.  In such a case,
     `INSN_FROM_TARGET_P' indicates that the insn is from the target of
     the branch and should be executed only if the branch is taken;
     otherwise the insn should be executed only if the branch is not
     taken.  *Note Delay Slots::.

   These expression codes appear in place of a side effect, as the body
of an insn, though strictly speaking they do not always describe side
effects as such:

`(asm_input S)'
     Represents literal assembler code as described by the string S.

`(unspec [OPERANDS ...] INDEX)'
`(unspec_volatile [OPERANDS ...] INDEX)'
     Represents a machine-specific operation on OPERANDS.  INDEX
     selects between multiple machine-specific operations.
     `unspec_volatile' is used for volatile operations and operations
     that may trap; `unspec' is used for other operations.

     These codes may appear inside a `pattern' of an insn, inside a
     `parallel', or inside an expression.

`(addr_vec:M [LR0 LR1 ...])'
     Represents a table of jump addresses.  The vector elements LR0,
     etc., are `label_ref' expressions.  The mode M specifies how much
     space is given to each address; normally M would be `Pmode'.

`(addr_diff_vec:M BASE [LR0 LR1 ...] MIN MAX FLAGS)'
     Represents a table of jump addresses expressed as offsets from
     BASE.  The vector elements LR0, etc., are `label_ref' expressions
     and so is BASE.  The mode M specifies how much space is given to
     each address-difference.  MIN and MAX are set up by branch
     shortening and hold a label with a minimum and a maximum address,
     respectively.  FLAGS indicates the relative position of BASE, MIN
     and MAX to the containing insn and of MIN and MAX to BASE.  See
     rtl.def for details.

`(prefetch:M ADDR RW LOCALITY)'
     Represents prefetch of memory at address ADDR.  Operand RW is 1 if
     the prefetch is for data to be written, 0 otherwise; targets that
     do not support write prefetches should treat this as a normal
     prefetch.  Operand LOCALITY specifies the amount of temporal
     locality; 0 if there is none or 1, 2, or 3 for increasing levels
     of temporal locality; targets that do not support locality hints
     should ignore this.

     This insn is used to minimize cache-miss latency by moving data
     into a cache before it is accessed.  It should use only
     non-faulting data prefetch instructions.

9.16 Embedded Side-Effects on Addresses
=======================================

Six special side-effect expression codes appear as memory addresses.

`(pre_dec:M X)'
     Represents the side effect of decrementing X by a standard amount
     and represents also the value that X has after being decremented.
     X must be a `reg' or `mem', but most machines allow only a `reg'.
     M must be the machine mode for pointers on the machine in use.
     The amount X is decremented by is the length in bytes of the
     machine mode of the containing memory reference of which this
     expression serves as the address.  Here is an example of its use:

          (mem:DF (pre_dec:SI (reg:SI 39)))

     This says to decrement pseudo register 39 by the length of a
     `DFmode' value and use the result to address a `DFmode' value.

`(pre_inc:M X)'
     Similar, but specifies incrementing X instead of decrementing it.

`(post_dec:M X)'
     Represents the same side effect as `pre_dec' but a different
     value.  The value represented here is the value X has before being
     decremented.

`(post_inc:M X)'
     Similar, but specifies incrementing X instead of decrementing it.

`(post_modify:M X Y)'
     Represents the side effect of setting X to Y and represents X
     before X is modified.  X must be a `reg' or `mem', but most
     machines allow only a `reg'.  M must be the machine mode for
     pointers on the machine in use.

     The expression Y must be one of three forms:
          `(plus:M X Z)', `(minus:M X Z)', or `(plus:M X I)',
     where Z is an index register and I is a constant.

     Here is an example of its use:

          (mem:SF (post_modify:SI (reg:SI 42) (plus (reg:SI 42)
                                                    (reg:SI 48))))

     This says to modify pseudo register 42 by adding the contents of
     pseudo register 48 to it, after the use of what ever 42 points to.

`(pre_modify:M X EXPR)'
     Similar except side effects happen before the use.

   These embedded side effect expressions must be used with care.
Instruction patterns may not use them.  Until the `flow' pass of the
compiler, they may occur only to represent pushes onto the stack.  The
`flow' pass finds cases where registers are incremented or decremented
in one instruction and used as an address shortly before or after;
these cases are then transformed to use pre- or post-increment or
-decrement.

   If a register used as the operand of these expressions is used in
another address in an insn, the original value of the register is used.
Uses of the register outside of an address are not permitted within the
same insn as a use in an embedded side effect expression because such
insns behave differently on different machines and hence must be treated
as ambiguous and disallowed.

   An instruction that can be represented with an embedded side effect
could also be represented using `parallel' containing an additional
`set' to describe how the address register is altered.  This is not
done because machines that allow these operations at all typically
allow them wherever a memory address is called for.  Describing them as
additional parallel stores would require doubling the number of entries
in the machine description.

9.17 Assembler Instructions as Expressions
==========================================

The RTX code `asm_operands' represents a value produced by a
user-specified assembler instruction.  It is used to represent an `asm'
statement with arguments.  An `asm' statement with a single output
operand, like this:

     asm ("foo %1,%2,%0" : "=a" (outputvar) : "g" (x + y), "di" (*z));

is represented using a single `asm_operands' RTX which represents the
value that is stored in `outputvar':

     (set RTX-FOR-OUTPUTVAR
          (asm_operands "foo %1,%2,%0" "a" 0
                        [RTX-FOR-ADDITION-RESULT RTX-FOR-*Z]
                        [(asm_input:M1 "g")
                         (asm_input:M2 "di")]))

Here the operands of the `asm_operands' RTX are the assembler template
string, the output-operand's constraint, the index-number of the output
operand among the output operands specified, a vector of input operand
RTX's, and a vector of input-operand modes and constraints.  The mode
M1 is the mode of the sum `x+y'; M2 is that of `*z'.

   When an `asm' statement has multiple output values, its insn has
several such `set' RTX's inside of a `parallel'.  Each `set' contains a
`asm_operands'; all of these share the same assembler template and
vectors, but each contains the constraint for the respective output
operand.  They are also distinguished by the output-operand index
number, which is 0, 1, ... for successive output operands.

9.18 Insns
==========

The RTL representation of the code for a function is a doubly-linked
chain of objects called "insns".  Insns are expressions with special
codes that are used for no other purpose.  Some insns are actual
instructions; others represent dispatch tables for `switch' statements;
others represent labels to jump to or various sorts of declarative
information.

   In addition to its own specific data, each insn must have a unique
id-number that distinguishes it from all other insns in the current
function (after delayed branch scheduling, copies of an insn with the
same id-number may be present in multiple places in a function, but
these copies will always be identical and will only appear inside a
`sequence'), and chain pointers to the preceding and following insns.
These three fields occupy the same position in every insn, independent
of the expression code of the insn.  They could be accessed with `XEXP'
and `XINT', but instead three special macros are always used:

`INSN_UID (I)'
     Accesses the unique id of insn I.

`PREV_INSN (I)'
     Accesses the chain pointer to the insn preceding I.  If I is the
     first insn, this is a null pointer.

`NEXT_INSN (I)'
     Accesses the chain pointer to the insn following I.  If I is the
     last insn, this is a null pointer.

   The first insn in the chain is obtained by calling `get_insns'; the
last insn is the result of calling `get_last_insn'.  Within the chain
delimited by these insns, the `NEXT_INSN' and `PREV_INSN' pointers must
always correspond: if INSN is not the first insn,

     NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (INSN)) == INSN

is always true and if INSN is not the last insn,

     PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN (INSN)) == INSN

is always true.

   After delay slot scheduling, some of the insns in the chain might be
`sequence' expressions, which contain a vector of insns.  The value of
`NEXT_INSN' in all but the last of these insns is the next insn in the
vector; the value of `NEXT_INSN' of the last insn in the vector is the
same as the value of `NEXT_INSN' for the `sequence' in which it is
contained.  Similar rules apply for `PREV_INSN'.

   This means that the above invariants are not necessarily true for
insns inside `sequence' expressions.  Specifically, if INSN is the
first insn in a `sequence', `NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (INSN))' is the insn
containing the `sequence' expression, as is the value of `PREV_INSN
(NEXT_INSN (INSN))' if INSN is the last insn in the `sequence'
expression.  You can use these expressions to find the containing
`sequence' expression.

   Every insn has one of the following six expression codes:

`insn'
     The expression code `insn' is used for instructions that do not
     jump and do not do function calls.  `sequence' expressions are
     always contained in insns with code `insn' even if one of those
     insns should jump or do function calls.

     Insns with code `insn' have four additional fields beyond the three
     mandatory ones listed above.  These four are described in a table
     below.

`jump_insn'
     The expression code `jump_insn' is used for instructions that may
     jump (or, more generally, may contain `label_ref' expressions).  If
     there is an instruction to return from the current function, it is
     recorded as a `jump_insn'.

     `jump_insn' insns have the same extra fields as `insn' insns,
     accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
     `JUMP_LABEL' which is defined once jump optimization has completed.

     For simple conditional and unconditional jumps, this field contains
     the `code_label' to which this insn will (possibly conditionally)
     branch.  In a more complex jump, `JUMP_LABEL' records one of the
     labels that the insn refers to; the only way to find the others is
     to scan the entire body of the insn.  In an `addr_vec',
     `JUMP_LABEL' is `NULL_RTX'.

     Return insns count as jumps, but since they do not refer to any
     labels, their `JUMP_LABEL' is `NULL_RTX'.

`call_insn'
     The expression code `call_insn' is used for instructions that may
     do function calls.  It is important to distinguish these
     instructions because they imply that certain registers and memory
     locations may be altered unpredictably.

     `call_insn' insns have the same extra fields as `insn' insns,
     accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
     `CALL_INSN_FUNCTION_USAGE', which contains a list (chain of
     `expr_list' expressions) containing `use' and `clobber'
     expressions that denote hard registers and `MEM's used or
     clobbered by the called function.

     A `MEM' generally points to a stack slots in which arguments passed
     to the libcall by reference (*note FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE:
     Register Arguments.) are stored.  If the argument is caller-copied
     (*note FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES: Register Arguments.), the stack
     slot will be mentioned in `CLOBBER' and `USE' entries; if it's
     callee-copied, only a `USE' will appear, and the `MEM' may point
     to addresses that are not stack slots.  These `MEM's are used only
     in libcalls, because, unlike regular function calls, `CONST_CALL's
     (which libcalls generally are, *note CONST_CALL_P: Flags.) aren't
     assumed to read and write all memory, so flow would consider the
     stores dead and remove them.  Note that, since a libcall must
     never return values in memory (*note RETURN_IN_MEMORY: Aggregate
     Return.), there will never be a `CLOBBER' for a memory address
     holding a return value.

     `CLOBBER'ed registers in this list augment registers specified in
     `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' (*note Register Basics::).

`code_label'
     A `code_label' insn represents a label that a jump insn can jump
     to.  It contains two special fields of data in addition to the
     three standard ones.  `CODE_LABEL_NUMBER' is used to hold the
     "label number", a number that identifies this label uniquely among
     all the labels in the compilation (not just in the current
     function).  Ultimately, the label is represented in the assembler
     output as an assembler label, usually of the form `LN' where N is
     the label number.

     When a `code_label' appears in an RTL expression, it normally
     appears within a `label_ref' which represents the address of the
     label, as a number.

     Besides as a `code_label', a label can also be represented as a
     `note' of type `NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL'.

     The field `LABEL_NUSES' is only defined once the jump optimization
     phase is completed.  It contains the number of times this label is
     referenced in the current function.

     The field `LABEL_KIND' differentiates four different types of
     labels: `LABEL_NORMAL', `LABEL_STATIC_ENTRY',
     `LABEL_GLOBAL_ENTRY', and `LABEL_WEAK_ENTRY'.  The only labels
     that do not have type `LABEL_NORMAL' are "alternate entry points"
     to the current function.  These may be static (visible only in the
     containing translation unit), global (exposed to all translation
     units), or weak (global, but can be overridden by another symbol
     with the same name).

     Much of the compiler treats all four kinds of label identically.
     Some of it needs to know whether or not a label is an alternate
     entry point; for this purpose, the macro `LABEL_ALT_ENTRY_P' is
     provided.  It is equivalent to testing whether `LABEL_KIND (label)
     == LABEL_NORMAL'.  The only place that cares about the distinction
     between static, global, and weak alternate entry points, besides
     the front-end code that creates them, is the function
     `output_alternate_entry_point', in `final.c'.

     To set the kind of a label, use the `SET_LABEL_KIND' macro.

`barrier'
     Barriers are placed in the instruction stream when control cannot
     flow past them.  They are placed after unconditional jump
     instructions to indicate that the jumps are unconditional and
     after calls to `volatile' functions, which do not return (e.g.,
     `exit').  They contain no information beyond the three standard
     fields.

`note'
     `note' insns are used to represent additional debugging and
     declarative information.  They contain two nonstandard fields, an
     integer which is accessed with the macro `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' and a
     string accessed with `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE'.

     If `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' is positive, the note represents the
     position of a source line and `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE' is the source
     file name that the line came from.  These notes control generation
     of line number data in the assembler output.

     Otherwise, `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' is not really a line number but a
     code with one of the following values (and `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE' must
     contain a null pointer):

    `NOTE_INSN_DELETED'
          Such a note is completely ignorable.  Some passes of the
          compiler delete insns by altering them into notes of this
          kind.

    `NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL'
          This marks what used to be a `code_label', but was not used
          for other purposes than taking its address and was
          transformed to mark that no code jumps to it.

    `NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_BEG'
    `NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_END'
          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
          and end of a level of scoping of variable names.  They
          control the output of debugging information.

    `NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_BEG'
    `NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_END'
          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
          and end of a level of scoping for exception handling.
          `NOTE_BLOCK_NUMBER' identifies which `CODE_LABEL' or `note'
          of type `NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL' is associated with the
          given region.

    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG'
    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END'
          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
          and end of a `while' or `for' loop.  They enable the loop
          optimizer to find loops quickly.

    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_CONT'
          Appears at the place in a loop that `continue' statements
          jump to.

    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP'
          This note indicates the place in a loop where the exit test
          begins for those loops in which the exit test has been
          duplicated.  This position becomes another virtual start of
          the loop when considering loop invariants.

    `NOTE_INSN_FUNCTION_END'
          Appears near the end of the function body, just before the
          label that `return' statements jump to (on machine where a
          single instruction does not suffice for returning).  This
          note may be deleted by jump optimization.

    `NOTE_INSN_SETJMP'
          Appears following each call to `setjmp' or a related function.

     These codes are printed symbolically when they appear in debugging
     dumps.

   The machine mode of an insn is normally `VOIDmode', but some phases
use the mode for various purposes.

   The common subexpression elimination pass sets the mode of an insn to
`QImode' when it is the first insn in a block that has already been
processed.

   The second Haifa scheduling pass, for targets that can multiple
issue, sets the mode of an insn to `TImode' when it is believed that the
instruction begins an issue group.  That is, when the instruction
cannot issue simultaneously with the previous.  This may be relied on
by later passes, in particular machine-dependent reorg.

   Here is a table of the extra fields of `insn', `jump_insn' and
`call_insn' insns:

`PATTERN (I)'
     An expression for the side effect performed by this insn.  This
     must be one of the following codes: `set', `call', `use',
     `clobber', `return', `asm_input', `asm_output', `addr_vec',
     `addr_diff_vec', `trap_if', `unspec', `unspec_volatile',
     `parallel', `cond_exec', or `sequence'.  If it is a `parallel',
     each element of the `parallel' must be one these codes, except that
     `parallel' expressions cannot be nested and `addr_vec' and
     `addr_diff_vec' are not permitted inside a `parallel' expression.

`INSN_CODE (I)'
     An integer that says which pattern in the machine description
     matches this insn, or -1 if the matching has not yet been
     attempted.

     Such matching is never attempted and this field remains -1 on an
     insn whose pattern consists of a single `use', `clobber',
     `asm_input', `addr_vec' or `addr_diff_vec' expression.

     Matching is also never attempted on insns that result from an `asm'
     statement.  These contain at least one `asm_operands' expression.
     The function `asm_noperands' returns a non-negative value for such
     insns.

     In the debugging output, this field is printed as a number
     followed by a symbolic representation that locates the pattern in
     the `md' file as some small positive or negative offset from a
     named pattern.

`LOG_LINKS (I)'
     A list (chain of `insn_list' expressions) giving information about
     dependencies between instructions within a basic block.  Neither a
     jump nor a label may come between the related insns.

`REG_NOTES (I)'
     A list (chain of `expr_list' and `insn_list' expressions) giving
     miscellaneous information about the insn.  It is often information
     pertaining to the registers used in this insn.

   The `LOG_LINKS' field of an insn is a chain of `insn_list'
expressions.  Each of these has two operands: the first is an insn, and
the second is another `insn_list' expression (the next one in the
chain).  The last `insn_list' in the chain has a null pointer as second
operand.  The significant thing about the chain is which insns appear
in it (as first operands of `insn_list' expressions).  Their order is
not significant.

   This list is originally set up by the flow analysis pass; it is a
null pointer until then.  Flow only adds links for those data
dependencies which can be used for instruction combination.  For each
insn, the flow analysis pass adds a link to insns which store into
registers values that are used for the first time in this insn.  The
instruction scheduling pass adds extra links so that every dependence
will be represented.  Links represent data dependencies,
antidependencies and output dependencies; the machine mode of the link
distinguishes these three types: antidependencies have mode
`REG_DEP_ANTI', output dependencies have mode `REG_DEP_OUTPUT', and
data dependencies have mode `VOIDmode'.

   The `REG_NOTES' field of an insn is a chain similar to the
`LOG_LINKS' field but it includes `expr_list' expressions in addition
to `insn_list' expressions.  There are several kinds of register notes,
which are distinguished by the machine mode, which in a register note
is really understood as being an `enum reg_note'.  The first operand OP
of the note is data whose meaning depends on the kind of note.

   The macro `REG_NOTE_KIND (X)' returns the kind of register note.
Its counterpart, the macro `PUT_REG_NOTE_KIND (X, NEWKIND)' sets the
register note type of X to be NEWKIND.

   Register notes are of three classes: They may say something about an
input to an insn, they may say something about an output of an insn, or
they may create a linkage between two insns.  There are also a set of
values that are only used in `LOG_LINKS'.

   These register notes annotate inputs to an insn:

`REG_DEAD'
     The value in OP dies in this insn; that is to say, altering the
     value immediately after this insn would not affect the future
     behavior of the program.

     It does not follow that the register OP has no useful value after
     this insn since OP is not necessarily modified by this insn.
     Rather, no subsequent instruction uses the contents of OP.

`REG_UNUSED'
     The register OP being set by this insn will not be used in a
     subsequent insn.  This differs from a `REG_DEAD' note, which
     indicates that the value in an input will not be used subsequently.
     These two notes are independent; both may be present for the same
     register.

`REG_INC'
     The register OP is incremented (or decremented; at this level
     there is no distinction) by an embedded side effect inside this
     insn.  This means it appears in a `post_inc', `pre_inc',
     `post_dec' or `pre_dec' expression.

`REG_NONNEG'
     The register OP is known to have a nonnegative value when this
     insn is reached.  This is used so that decrement and branch until
     zero instructions, such as the m68k dbra, can be matched.

     The `REG_NONNEG' note is added to insns only if the machine
     description has a `decrement_and_branch_until_zero' pattern.

`REG_NO_CONFLICT'
     This insn does not cause a conflict between OP and the item being
     set by this insn even though it might appear that it does.  In
     other words, if the destination register and OP could otherwise be
     assigned the same register, this insn does not prevent that
     assignment.

     Insns with this note are usually part of a block that begins with a
     `clobber' insn specifying a multi-word pseudo register (which will
     be the output of the block), a group of insns that each set one
     word of the value and have the `REG_NO_CONFLICT' note attached,
     and a final insn that copies the output to itself with an attached
     `REG_EQUAL' note giving the expression being computed.  This block
     is encapsulated with `REG_LIBCALL' and `REG_RETVAL' notes on the
     first and last insns, respectively.

`REG_LABEL'
     This insn uses OP, a `code_label' or a `note' of type
     `NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL', but is not a `jump_insn', or it is a
     `jump_insn' that required the label to be held in a register.  The
     presence of this note allows jump optimization to be aware that OP
     is, in fact, being used, and flow optimization to build an
     accurate flow graph.

   The following notes describe attributes of outputs of an insn:

`REG_EQUIV'
`REG_EQUAL'
     This note is only valid on an insn that sets only one register and
     indicates that that register will be equal to OP at run time; the
     scope of this equivalence differs between the two types of notes.
     The value which the insn explicitly copies into the register may
     look different from OP, but they will be equal at run time.  If the
     output of the single `set' is a `strict_low_part' expression, the
     note refers to the register that is contained in `SUBREG_REG' of
     the `subreg' expression.

     For `REG_EQUIV', the register is equivalent to OP throughout the
     entire function, and could validly be replaced in all its
     occurrences by OP.  ("Validly" here refers to the data flow of the
     program; simple replacement may make some insns invalid.)  For
     example, when a constant is loaded into a register that is never
     assigned any other value, this kind of note is used.

     When a parameter is copied into a pseudo-register at entry to a
     function, a note of this kind records that the register is
     equivalent to the stack slot where the parameter was passed.
     Although in this case the register may be set by other insns, it
     is still valid to replace the register by the stack slot
     throughout the function.

     A `REG_EQUIV' note is also used on an instruction which copies a
     register parameter into a pseudo-register at entry to a function,
     if there is a stack slot where that parameter could be stored.
     Although other insns may set the pseudo-register, it is valid for
     the compiler to replace the pseudo-register by stack slot
     throughout the function, provided the compiler ensures that the
     stack slot is properly initialized by making the replacement in
     the initial copy instruction as well.  This is used on machines
     for which the calling convention allocates stack space for
     register parameters.  See `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' in *Note Stack
     Arguments::.

     In the case of `REG_EQUAL', the register that is set by this insn
     will be equal to OP at run time at the end of this insn but not
     necessarily elsewhere in the function.  In this case, OP is
     typically an arithmetic expression.  For example, when a sequence
     of insns such as a library call is used to perform an arithmetic
     operation, this kind of note is attached to the insn that produces
     or copies the final value.

     These two notes are used in different ways by the compiler passes.
     `REG_EQUAL' is used by passes prior to register allocation (such as
     common subexpression elimination and loop optimization) to tell
     them how to think of that value.  `REG_EQUIV' notes are used by
     register allocation to indicate that there is an available
     substitute expression (either a constant or a `mem' expression for
     the location of a parameter on the stack) that may be used in
     place of a register if insufficient registers are available.

     Except for stack homes for parameters, which are indicated by a
     `REG_EQUIV' note and are not useful to the early optimization
     passes and pseudo registers that are equivalent to a memory
     location throughout their entire life, which is not detected until
     later in the compilation, all equivalences are initially indicated
     by an attached `REG_EQUAL' note.  In the early stages of register
     allocation, a `REG_EQUAL' note is changed into a `REG_EQUIV' note
     if OP is a constant and the insn represents the only set of its
     destination register.

     Thus, compiler passes prior to register allocation need only check
     for `REG_EQUAL' notes and passes subsequent to register allocation
     need only check for `REG_EQUIV' notes.

   These notes describe linkages between insns.  They occur in pairs:
one insn has one of a pair of notes that points to a second insn, which
has the inverse note pointing back to the first insn.

`REG_RETVAL'
     This insn copies the value of a multi-insn sequence (for example, a
     library call), and OP is the first insn of the sequence (for a
     library call, the first insn that was generated to set up the
     arguments for the library call).

     Loop optimization uses this note to treat such a sequence as a
     single operation for code motion purposes and flow analysis uses
     this note to delete such sequences whose results are dead.

     A `REG_EQUAL' note will also usually be attached to this insn to
     provide the expression being computed by the sequence.

     These notes will be deleted after reload, since they are no longer
     accurate or useful.

`REG_LIBCALL'
     This is the inverse of `REG_RETVAL': it is placed on the first
     insn of a multi-insn sequence, and it points to the last one.

     These notes are deleted after reload, since they are no longer
     useful or accurate.

`REG_CC_SETTER'
`REG_CC_USER'
     On machines that use `cc0', the insns which set and use `cc0' set
     and use `cc0' are adjacent.  However, when branch delay slot
     filling is done, this may no longer be true.  In this case a
     `REG_CC_USER' note will be placed on the insn setting `cc0' to
     point to the insn using `cc0' and a `REG_CC_SETTER' note will be
     placed on the insn using `cc0' to point to the insn setting `cc0'.

   These values are only used in the `LOG_LINKS' field, and indicate
the type of dependency that each link represents.  Links which indicate
a data dependence (a read after write dependence) do not use any code,
they simply have mode `VOIDmode', and are printed without any
descriptive text.

`REG_DEP_ANTI'
     This indicates an anti dependence (a write after read dependence).

`REG_DEP_OUTPUT'
     This indicates an output dependence (a write after write
     dependence).

   These notes describe information gathered from gcov profile data.
They are stored in the `REG_NOTES' field of an insn as an `expr_list'.

`REG_BR_PROB'
     This is used to specify the ratio of branches to non-branches of a
     branch insn according to the profile data.  The value is stored as
     a value between 0 and REG_BR_PROB_BASE; larger values indicate a
     higher probability that the branch will be taken.

`REG_BR_PRED'
     These notes are found in JUMP insns after delayed branch scheduling
     has taken place.  They indicate both the direction and the
     likelihood of the JUMP.  The format is a bitmask of ATTR_FLAG_*
     values.

`REG_FRAME_RELATED_EXPR'
     This is used on an RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P insn wherein the attached
     expression is used in place of the actual insn pattern.  This is
     done in cases where the pattern is either complex or misleading.

   For convenience, the machine mode in an `insn_list' or `expr_list'
is printed using these symbolic codes in debugging dumps.

   The only difference between the expression codes `insn_list' and
`expr_list' is that the first operand of an `insn_list' is assumed to
be an insn and is printed in debugging dumps as the insn's unique id;
the first operand of an `expr_list' is printed in the ordinary way as
an expression.

9.19 RTL Representation of Function-Call Insns
==============================================

Insns that call subroutines have the RTL expression code `call_insn'.
These insns must satisfy special rules, and their bodies must use a
special RTL expression code, `call'.

   A `call' expression has two operands, as follows:

     (call (mem:FM ADDR) NBYTES)

Here NBYTES is an operand that represents the number of bytes of
argument data being passed to the subroutine, FM is a machine mode
(which must equal as the definition of the `FUNCTION_MODE' macro in the
machine description) and ADDR represents the address of the subroutine.

   For a subroutine that returns no value, the `call' expression as
shown above is the entire body of the insn, except that the insn might
also contain `use' or `clobber' expressions.

   For a subroutine that returns a value whose mode is not `BLKmode',
the value is returned in a hard register.  If this register's number is
R, then the body of the call insn looks like this:

     (set (reg:M R)
          (call (mem:FM ADDR) NBYTES))

This RTL expression makes it clear (to the optimizer passes) that the
appropriate register receives a useful value in this insn.

   When a subroutine returns a `BLKmode' value, it is handled by
passing to the subroutine the address of a place to store the value.
So the call insn itself does not "return" any value, and it has the
same RTL form as a call that returns nothing.

   On some machines, the call instruction itself clobbers some register,
for example to contain the return address.  `call_insn' insns on these
machines should have a body which is a `parallel' that contains both
the `call' expression and `clobber' expressions that indicate which
registers are destroyed.  Similarly, if the call instruction requires
some register other than the stack pointer that is not explicitly
mentioned it its RTL, a `use' subexpression should mention that
register.

   Functions that are called are assumed to modify all registers listed
in the configuration macro `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' (*note Register
Basics::) and, with the exception of `const' functions and library
calls, to modify all of memory.

   Insns containing just `use' expressions directly precede the
`call_insn' insn to indicate which registers contain inputs to the
function.  Similarly, if registers other than those in
`CALL_USED_REGISTERS' are clobbered by the called function, insns
containing a single `clobber' follow immediately after the call to
indicate which registers.

9.20 Structure Sharing Assumptions
==================================

The compiler assumes that certain kinds of RTL expressions are unique;
there do not exist two distinct objects representing the same value.
In other cases, it makes an opposite assumption: that no RTL expression
object of a certain kind appears in more than one place in the
containing structure.

   These assumptions refer to a single function; except for the RTL
objects that describe global variables and external functions, and a
few standard objects such as small integer constants, no RTL objects
are common to two functions.

   * Each pseudo-register has only a single `reg' object to represent
     it, and therefore only a single machine mode.

   * For any symbolic label, there is only one `symbol_ref' object
     referring to it.

   * All `const_int' expressions with equal values are shared.

   * There is only one `pc' expression.

   * There is only one `cc0' expression.

   * There is only one `const_double' expression with value 0 for each
     floating point mode.  Likewise for values 1 and 2.

   * There is only one `const_vector' expression with value 0 for each
     vector mode, be it an integer or a double constant vector.

   * No `label_ref' or `scratch' appears in more than one place in the
     RTL structure; in other words, it is safe to do a tree-walk of all
     the insns in the function and assume that each time a `label_ref'
     or `scratch' is seen it is distinct from all others that are seen.

   * Only one `mem' object is normally created for each static variable
     or stack slot, so these objects are frequently shared in all the
     places they appear.  However, separate but equal objects for these
     variables are occasionally made.

   * When a single `asm' statement has multiple output operands, a
     distinct `asm_operands' expression is made for each output operand.
     However, these all share the vector which contains the sequence of
     input operands.  This sharing is used later on to test whether two
     `asm_operands' expressions come from the same statement, so all
     optimizations must carefully preserve the sharing if they copy the
     vector at all.

   * No RTL object appears in more than one place in the RTL structure
     except as described above.  Many passes of the compiler rely on
     this by assuming that they can modify RTL objects in place without
     unwanted side-effects on other insns.

   * During initial RTL generation, shared structure is freely
     introduced.  After all the RTL for a function has been generated,
     all shared structure is copied by `unshare_all_rtl' in
     `emit-rtl.c', after which the above rules are guaranteed to be
     followed.

   * During the combiner pass, shared structure within an insn can exist
     temporarily.  However, the shared structure is copied before the
     combiner is finished with the insn.  This is done by calling
     `copy_rtx_if_shared', which is a subroutine of `unshare_all_rtl'.

9.21 Reading RTL
================

To read an RTL object from a file, call `read_rtx'.  It takes one
argument, a stdio stream, and returns a single RTL object.  This routine
is defined in `read-rtl.c'.  It is not available in the compiler
itself, only the various programs that generate the compiler back end
from the machine description.

   People frequently have the idea of using RTL stored as text in a
file as an interface between a language front end and the bulk of GCC.
This idea is not feasible.

   GCC was designed to use RTL internally only.  Correct RTL for a given
program is very dependent on the particular target machine.  And the RTL
does not contain all the information about the program.

   The proper way to interface GCC to a new language front end is with
the "tree" data structure, described in the files `tree.h' and
`tree.def'.  The documentation for this structure (*note Trees::) is
incomplete.

10 Machine Descriptions
***********************

A machine description has two parts: a file of instruction patterns
(`.md' file) and a C header file of macro definitions.

   The `.md' file for a target machine contains a pattern for each
instruction that the target machine supports (or at least each
instruction that is worth telling the compiler about).  It may also
contain comments.  A semicolon causes the rest of the line to be a
comment, unless the semicolon is inside a quoted string.

   See the next chapter for information on the C header file.

10.1 Overview of How the Machine Description is Used
====================================================

There are three main conversions that happen in the compiler:

  1. The front end reads the source code and builds a parse tree.

  2. The parse tree is used to generate an RTL insn list based on named
     instruction patterns.

  3. The insn list is matched against the RTL templates to produce
     assembler code.


   For the generate pass, only the names of the insns matter, from
either a named `define_insn' or a `define_expand'.  The compiler will
choose the pattern with the right name and apply the operands according
to the documentation later in this chapter, without regard for the RTL
template or operand constraints.  Note that the names the compiler looks
for are hard-coded in the compiler--it will ignore unnamed patterns and
patterns with names it doesn't know about, but if you don't provide a
named pattern it needs, it will abort.

   If a `define_insn' is used, the template given is inserted into the
insn list.  If a `define_expand' is used, one of three things happens,
based on the condition logic.  The condition logic may manually create
new insns for the insn list, say via `emit_insn()', and invoke `DONE'.
For certain named patterns, it may invoke `FAIL' to tell the compiler
to use an alternate way of performing that task.  If it invokes neither
`DONE' nor `FAIL', the template given in the pattern is inserted, as if
the `define_expand' were a `define_insn'.

   Once the insn list is generated, various optimization passes convert,
replace, and rearrange the insns in the insn list.  This is where the
`define_split' and `define_peephole' patterns get used, for example.

   Finally, the insn list's RTL is matched up with the RTL templates in
the `define_insn' patterns, and those patterns are used to emit the
final assembly code.  For this purpose, each named `define_insn' acts
like it's unnamed, since the names are ignored.

10.2 Everything about Instruction Patterns
==========================================

Each instruction pattern contains an incomplete RTL expression, with
pieces to be filled in later, operand constraints that restrict how the
pieces can be filled in, and an output pattern or C code to generate
the assembler output, all wrapped up in a `define_insn' expression.

   A `define_insn' is an RTL expression containing four or five
operands:

  1. An optional name.  The presence of a name indicate that this
     instruction pattern can perform a certain standard job for the
     RTL-generation pass of the compiler.  This pass knows certain
     names and will use the instruction patterns with those names, if
     the names are defined in the machine description.

     The absence of a name is indicated by writing an empty string
     where the name should go.  Nameless instruction patterns are never
     used for generating RTL code, but they may permit several simpler
     insns to be combined later on.

     Names that are not thus known and used in RTL-generation have no
     effect; they are equivalent to no name at all.

     For the purpose of debugging the compiler, you may also specify a
     name beginning with the `*' character.  Such a name is used only
     for identifying the instruction in RTL dumps; it is entirely
     equivalent to having a nameless pattern for all other purposes.

  2. The "RTL template" (*note RTL Template::) is a vector of incomplete
     RTL expressions which show what the instruction should look like.
     It is incomplete because it may contain `match_operand',
     `match_operator', and `match_dup' expressions that stand for
     operands of the instruction.

     If the vector has only one element, that element is the template
     for the instruction pattern.  If the vector has multiple elements,
     then the instruction pattern is a `parallel' expression containing
     the elements described.

  3. A condition.  This is a string which contains a C expression that
     is the final test to decide whether an insn body matches this
     pattern.

     For a named pattern, the condition (if present) may not depend on
     the data in the insn being matched, but only the
     target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to test these
     conditions during initialization in order to learn exactly which
     named instructions are available in a particular run.

     For nameless patterns, the condition is applied only when matching
     an individual insn, and only after the insn has matched the
     pattern's recognition template.  The insn's operands may be found
     in the vector `operands'.  For an insn where the condition has
     once matched, it can't be used to control register allocation, for
     example by excluding certain hard registers or hard register
     combinations.

  4. The "output template": a string that says how to output matching
     insns as assembler code.  `%' in this string specifies where to
     substitute the value of an operand.  *Note Output Template::.

     When simple substitution isn't general enough, you can specify a
     piece of C code to compute the output.  *Note Output Statement::.

  5. Optionally, a vector containing the values of attributes for insns
     matching this pattern.  *Note Insn Attributes::.

10.3 Example of `define_insn'
=============================

Here is an actual example of an instruction pattern, for the
68000/68020.

     (define_insn "tstsi"
       [(set (cc0)
             (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "rm"))]
       ""
       "*
     {
       if (TARGET_68020 || ! ADDRESS_REG_P (operands[0]))
         return \"tstl %0\";
       return \"cmpl #0,%0\";
     }")

This can also be written using braced strings:

     (define_insn "tstsi"
       [(set (cc0)
             (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "rm"))]
       ""
     {
       if (TARGET_68020 || ! ADDRESS_REG_P (operands[0]))
         return "tstl %0";
       return "cmpl #0,%0";
     })

   This is an instruction that sets the condition codes based on the
value of a general operand.  It has no condition, so any insn whose RTL
description has the form shown may be handled according to this
pattern.  The name `tstsi' means "test a `SImode' value" and tells the
RTL generation pass that, when it is necessary to test such a value, an
insn to do so can be constructed using this pattern.

   The output control string is a piece of C code which chooses which
output template to return based on the kind of operand and the specific
type of CPU for which code is being generated.

   `"rm"' is an operand constraint.  Its meaning is explained below.

10.4 RTL Template
=================

The RTL template is used to define which insns match the particular
pattern and how to find their operands.  For named patterns, the RTL
template also says how to construct an insn from specified operands.

   Construction involves substituting specified operands into a copy of
the template.  Matching involves determining the values that serve as
the operands in the insn being matched.  Both of these activities are
controlled by special expression types that direct matching and
substitution of the operands.

`(match_operand:M N PREDICATE CONSTRAINT)'
     This expression is a placeholder for operand number N of the insn.
     When constructing an insn, operand number N will be substituted
     at this point.  When matching an insn, whatever appears at this
     position in the insn will be taken as operand number N; but it
     must satisfy PREDICATE or this instruction pattern will not match
     at all.

     Operand numbers must be chosen consecutively counting from zero in
     each instruction pattern.  There may be only one `match_operand'
     expression in the pattern for each operand number.  Usually
     operands are numbered in the order of appearance in `match_operand'
     expressions.  In the case of a `define_expand', any operand numbers
     used only in `match_dup' expressions have higher values than all
     other operand numbers.

     PREDICATE is a string that is the name of a C function that
     accepts two arguments, an expression and a machine mode.  During
     matching, the function will be called with the putative operand as
     the expression and M as the mode argument (if M is not specified,
     `VOIDmode' will be used, which normally causes PREDICATE to accept
     any mode).  If it returns zero, this instruction pattern fails to
     match.  PREDICATE may be an empty string; then it means no test is
     to be done on the operand, so anything which occurs in this
     position is valid.

     Most of the time, PREDICATE will reject modes other than M--but
     not always.  For example, the predicate `address_operand' uses M
     as the mode of memory ref that the address should be valid for.
     Many predicates accept `const_int' nodes even though their mode is
     `VOIDmode'.

     CONSTRAINT controls reloading and the choice of the best register
     class to use for a value, as explained later (*note Constraints::).

     People are often unclear on the difference between the constraint
     and the predicate.  The predicate helps decide whether a given
     insn matches the pattern.  The constraint plays no role in this
     decision; instead, it controls various decisions in the case of an
     insn which does match.

     On CISC machines, the most common PREDICATE is
     `"general_operand"'.  This function checks that the putative
     operand is either a constant, a register or a memory reference,
     and that it is valid for mode M.

     For an operand that must be a register, PREDICATE should be
     `"register_operand"'.  Using `"general_operand"' would be valid,
     since the reload pass would copy any non-register operands through
     registers, but this would make GCC do extra work, it would prevent
     invariant operands (such as constant) from being removed from
     loops, and it would prevent the register allocator from doing the
     best possible job.  On RISC machines, it is usually most efficient
     to allow PREDICATE to accept only objects that the constraints
     allow.

     For an operand that must be a constant, you must be sure to either
     use `"immediate_operand"' for PREDICATE, or make the instruction
     pattern's extra condition require a constant, or both.  You cannot
     expect the constraints to do this work!  If the constraints allow
     only constants, but the predicate allows something else, the
     compiler will crash when that case arises.

`(match_scratch:M N CONSTRAINT)'
     This expression is also a placeholder for operand number N and
     indicates that operand must be a `scratch' or `reg' expression.

     When matching patterns, this is equivalent to

          (match_operand:M N "scratch_operand" PRED)

     but, when generating RTL, it produces a (`scratch':M) expression.

     If the last few expressions in a `parallel' are `clobber'
     expressions whose operands are either a hard register or
     `match_scratch', the combiner can add or delete them when
     necessary.  *Note Side Effects::.

`(match_dup N)'
     This expression is also a placeholder for operand number N.  It is
     used when the operand needs to appear more than once in the insn.

     In construction, `match_dup' acts just like `match_operand': the
     operand is substituted into the insn being constructed.  But in
     matching, `match_dup' behaves differently.  It assumes that operand
     number N has already been determined by a `match_operand'
     appearing earlier in the recognition template, and it matches only
     an identical-looking expression.

     Note that `match_dup' should not be used to tell the compiler that
     a particular register is being used for two operands (example:
     `add' that adds one register to another; the second register is
     both an input operand and the output operand).  Use a matching
     constraint (*note Simple Constraints::) for those.  `match_dup' is
     for the cases where one operand is used in two places in the
     template, such as an instruction that computes both a quotient and
     a remainder, where the opcode takes two input operands but the RTL
     template has to refer to each of those twice; once for the
     quotient pattern and once for the remainder pattern.

`(match_operator:M N PREDICATE [OPERANDS...])'
     This pattern is a kind of placeholder for a variable RTL expression
     code.

     When constructing an insn, it stands for an RTL expression whose
     expression code is taken from that of operand N, and whose
     operands are constructed from the patterns OPERANDS.

     When matching an expression, it matches an expression if the
     function PREDICATE returns nonzero on that expression _and_ the
     patterns OPERANDS match the operands of the expression.

     Suppose that the function `commutative_operator' is defined as
     follows, to match any expression whose operator is one of the
     commutative arithmetic operators of RTL and whose mode is MODE:

          int
          commutative_operator (x, mode)
               rtx x;
               enum machine_mode mode;
          {
            enum rtx_code code = GET_CODE (x);
            if (GET_MODE (x) != mode)
              return 0;
            return (GET_RTX_CLASS (code) == 'c'
                    || code == EQ || code == NE);
          }

     Then the following pattern will match any RTL expression consisting
     of a commutative operator applied to two general operands:

          (match_operator:SI 3 "commutative_operator"
            [(match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "g")
             (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g")])

     Here the vector `[OPERANDS...]' contains two patterns because the
     expressions to be matched all contain two operands.

     When this pattern does match, the two operands of the commutative
     operator are recorded as operands 1 and 2 of the insn.  (This is
     done by the two instances of `match_operand'.)  Operand 3 of the
     insn will be the entire commutative expression: use `GET_CODE
     (operands[3])' to see which commutative operator was used.

     The machine mode M of `match_operator' works like that of
     `match_operand': it is passed as the second argument to the
     predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
     deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.

     When constructing an insn, argument 3 of the gen-function will
     specify the operation (i.e. the expression code) for the
     expression to be made.  It should be an RTL expression, whose
     expression code is copied into a new expression whose operands are
     arguments 1 and 2 of the gen-function.  The subexpressions of
     argument 3 are not used; only its expression code matters.

     When `match_operator' is used in a pattern for matching an insn,
     it usually best if the operand number of the `match_operator' is
     higher than that of the actual operands of the insn.  This improves
     register allocation because the register allocator often looks at
     operands 1 and 2 of insns to see if it can do register tying.

     There is no way to specify constraints in `match_operator'.  The
     operand of the insn which corresponds to the `match_operator'
     never has any constraints because it is never reloaded as a whole.
     However, if parts of its OPERANDS are matched by `match_operand'
     patterns, those parts may have constraints of their own.

`(match_op_dup:M N[OPERANDS...])'
     Like `match_dup', except that it applies to operators instead of
     operands.  When constructing an insn, operand number N will be
     substituted at this point.  But in matching, `match_op_dup' behaves
     differently.  It assumes that operand number N has already been
     determined by a `match_operator' appearing earlier in the
     recognition template, and it matches only an identical-looking
     expression.

`(match_parallel N PREDICATE [SUBPAT...])'
     This pattern is a placeholder for an insn that consists of a
     `parallel' expression with a variable number of elements.  This
     expression should only appear at the top level of an insn pattern.

     When constructing an insn, operand number N will be substituted at
     this point.  When matching an insn, it matches if the body of the
     insn is a `parallel' expression with at least as many elements as
     the vector of SUBPAT expressions in the `match_parallel', if each
     SUBPAT matches the corresponding element of the `parallel', _and_
     the function PREDICATE returns nonzero on the `parallel' that is
     the body of the insn.  It is the responsibility of the predicate
     to validate elements of the `parallel' beyond those listed in the
     `match_parallel'.

     A typical use of `match_parallel' is to match load and store
     multiple expressions, which can contain a variable number of
     elements in a `parallel'.  For example,

          (define_insn ""
            [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
               [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
                (use (reg:SI 179))
                (clobber (reg:SI 179))])]
            ""
            "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")

     This example comes from `a29k.md'.  The function
     `load_multiple_operation' is defined in `a29k.c' and checks that
     subsequent elements in the `parallel' are the same as the `set' in
     the pattern, except that they are referencing subsequent registers
     and memory locations.

     An insn that matches this pattern might look like:

          (parallel
           [(set (reg:SI 20) (mem:SI (reg:SI 100)))
            (use (reg:SI 179))
            (clobber (reg:SI 179))
            (set (reg:SI 21)
                 (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
                                  (const_int 4))))
            (set (reg:SI 22)
                 (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
                                  (const_int 8))))])

`(match_par_dup N [SUBPAT...])'
     Like `match_op_dup', but for `match_parallel' instead of
     `match_operator'.

`(match_insn PREDICATE)'
     Match a complete insn.  Unlike the other `match_*' recognizers,
     `match_insn' does not take an operand number.

     The machine mode M of `match_insn' works like that of
     `match_operand': it is passed as the second argument to the
     predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
     deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.

`(match_insn2 N PREDICATE)'
     Match a complete insn.

     The machine mode M of `match_insn2' works like that of
     `match_operand': it is passed as the second argument to the
     predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
     deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.

10.5 Output Templates and Operand Substitution
==============================================

The "output template" is a string which specifies how to output the
assembler code for an instruction pattern.  Most of the template is a
fixed string which is output literally.  The character `%' is used to
specify where to substitute an operand; it can also be used to identify
places where different variants of the assembler require different
syntax.

   In the simplest case, a `%' followed by a digit N says to output
operand N at that point in the string.

   `%' followed by a letter and a digit says to output an operand in an
alternate fashion.  Four letters have standard, built-in meanings
described below.  The machine description macro `PRINT_OPERAND' can
define additional letters with nonstandard meanings.

   `%cDIGIT' can be used to substitute an operand that is a constant
value without the syntax that normally indicates an immediate operand.

   `%nDIGIT' is like `%cDIGIT' except that the value of the constant is
negated before printing.

   `%aDIGIT' can be used to substitute an operand as if it were a
memory reference, with the actual operand treated as the address.  This
may be useful when outputting a "load address" instruction, because
often the assembler syntax for such an instruction requires you to
write the operand as if it were a memory reference.

   `%lDIGIT' is used to substitute a `label_ref' into a jump
instruction.

   `%=' outputs a number which is unique to each instruction in the
entire compilation.  This is useful for making local labels to be
referred to more than once in a single template that generates multiple
assembler instructions.

   `%' followed by a punctuation character specifies a substitution that
does not use an operand.  Only one case is standard: `%%' outputs a `%'
into the assembler code.  Other nonstandard cases can be defined in the
`PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  You must also define which punctuation
characters are valid with the `PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' macro.

   The template may generate multiple assembler instructions.  Write
the text for the instructions, with `\;' between them.

   When the RTL contains two operands which are required by constraint
to match each other, the output template must refer only to the
lower-numbered operand.  Matching operands are not always identical,
and the rest of the compiler arranges to put the proper RTL expression
for printing into the lower-numbered operand.

   One use of nonstandard letters or punctuation following `%' is to
distinguish between different assembler languages for the same machine;
for example, Motorola syntax versus MIT syntax for the 68000.  Motorola
syntax requires periods in most opcode names, while MIT syntax does
not.  For example, the opcode `movel' in MIT syntax is `move.l' in
Motorola syntax.  The same file of patterns is used for both kinds of
output syntax, but the character sequence `%.' is used in each place
where Motorola syntax wants a period.  The `PRINT_OPERAND' macro for
Motorola syntax defines the sequence to output a period; the macro for
MIT syntax defines it to do nothing.

   As a special case, a template consisting of the single character `#'
instructs the compiler to first split the insn, and then output the
resulting instructions separately.  This helps eliminate redundancy in
the output templates.   If you have a `define_insn' that needs to emit
multiple assembler instructions, and there is an matching `define_split'
already defined, then you can simply use `#' as the output template
instead of writing an output template that emits the multiple assembler
instructions.

   If the macro `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' is defined, you can use construct
of the form `{option0|option1|option2}' in the templates.  These
describe multiple variants of assembler language syntax.  *Note
Instruction Output::.

10.6 C Statements for Assembler Output
======================================

Often a single fixed template string cannot produce correct and
efficient assembler code for all the cases that are recognized by a
single instruction pattern.  For example, the opcodes may depend on the
kinds of operands; or some unfortunate combinations of operands may
require extra machine instructions.

   If the output control string starts with a `@', then it is actually
a series of templates, each on a separate line.  (Blank lines and
leading spaces and tabs are ignored.)  The templates correspond to the
pattern's constraint alternatives (*note Multi-Alternative::).  For
example, if a target machine has a two-address add instruction `addr'
to add into a register and another `addm' to add a register to memory,
you might write this pattern:

     (define_insn "addsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0,0")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g,r")))]
       ""
       "@
        addr %2,%0
        addm %2,%0")

   If the output control string starts with a `*', then it is not an
output template but rather a piece of C program that should compute a
template.  It should execute a `return' statement to return the
template-string you want.  Most such templates use C string literals,
which require doublequote characters to delimit them.  To include these
doublequote characters in the string, prefix each one with `\'.

   If the output control string is written as a brace block instead of a
double-quoted string, it is automatically assumed to be C code.  In that
case, it is not necessary to put in a leading asterisk, or to escape the
doublequotes surrounding C string literals.

   The operands may be found in the array `operands', whose C data type
is `rtx []'.

   It is very common to select different ways of generating assembler
code based on whether an immediate operand is within a certain range.
Be careful when doing this, because the result of `INTVAL' is an
integer on the host machine.  If the host machine has more bits in an
`int' than the target machine has in the mode in which the constant
will be used, then some of the bits you get from `INTVAL' will be
superfluous.  For proper results, you must carefully disregard the
values of those bits.

   It is possible to output an assembler instruction and then go on to
output or compute more of them, using the subroutine `output_asm_insn'.
This receives two arguments: a template-string and a vector of
operands.  The vector may be `operands', or it may be another array of
`rtx' that you declare locally and initialize yourself.

   When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints,
often the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by
which alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code can test
the variable `which_alternative', which is the ordinal number of the
alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for the first, 1 for the
second alternative, etc.).

   For example, suppose there are two opcodes for storing zero, `clrreg'
for registers and `clrmem' for memory locations.  Here is how a pattern
could use `which_alternative' to choose between them:

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
             (const_int 0))]
       ""
       {
       return (which_alternative == 0
               ? "clrreg %0" : "clrmem %0");
       })

   The example above, where the assembler code to generate was _solely_
determined by the alternative, could also have been specified as
follows, having the output control string start with a `@':

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
             (const_int 0))]
       ""

10.7 Operand Constraints
========================

Each `match_operand' in an instruction pattern can specify a constraint
for the type of operands allowed.  Constraints can say whether an
operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register; whether the
operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of address; whether
the operand may be an immediate constant, and which possible values it
may have.  Constraints can also require two operands to match.

10.7.1 Simple Constraints
-------------------------

The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are the
letters that are allowed:

whitespace
     Whitespace characters are ignored and can be inserted at any
     position except the first.  This enables each alternative for
     different operands to be visually aligned in the machine
     description even if they have different number of constraints and
     modifiers.

`m'
     A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the
     machine supports in general.

`o'
     A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
     "offsettable".  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
     the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine
     mode) may be added to the address and the result is also a valid
     memory address.

     For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
     address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
     slightly larger constant is also within the range of
     address-offsets supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or
     autodecrement address is not offsettable.  More complicated
     indirect/indexed addresses may or may not be offsettable depending
     on the other addressing modes that the machine supports.

     Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
     operand, the constraint letter `o' is valid only when accompanied
     by both `<' (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
     and `>' (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).

`V'
     A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words,
     anything that would fit the `m' constraint but not the `o'
     constraint.

`<'
     A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either
     predecrement or postdecrement) is allowed.

`>'
     A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either
     preincrement or postincrement) is allowed.

`r'
     A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
     register.

`i'
     An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed.
     This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
     assembly time.

`n'
     An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed.
     Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands
     less than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use
     `n' rather than `i'.

`I', `J', `K', ... `P'
     Other letters in the range `I' through `P' may be defined in a
     machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
     explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
     68000, `I' is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8.
     This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
     instructions.

`E'
     An immediate floating operand (expression code `const_double') is
     allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same
     as that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).

`F'
     An immediate floating operand (expression code `const_double' or
     `const_vector') is allowed.

`G', `H'
     `G' and `H' may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to
     permit immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.

`s'
     An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit
     integer is allowed.

     This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand
     with a value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow
     any known value.  So why use `s' instead of `i'?  Sometimes it
     allows better code to be generated.

     For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible
     to use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between
     -128 and 127, better code results from loading the value into a
     register and using the register.  This is because the load into
     the register can be done with a `moveq' instruction.  We arrange
     for this to happen by defining the letter `K' to mean "any integer
     outside the range -128 to 127", and then specifying `Ks' in the
     operand constraints.

`g'
     Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed,
     except for registers that are not general registers.

`X'
     Any operand whatsoever is allowed, even if it does not satisfy
     `general_operand'.  This is normally used in the constraint of a
     `match_scratch' when certain alternatives will not actually
     require a scratch register.

`0', `1', `2', ... `9'
     An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.
     If a digit is used together with letters within the same
     alternative, the digit should come last.

     This number is allowed to be more than a single digit.  If multiple
     digits are encountered consecutively, they are interpreted as a
     single decimal integer.  There is scant chance for ambiguity,
     since to-date it has never been desirable that `10' be interpreted
     as matching either operand 1 _or_ operand 0.  Should this be
     desired, one can use multiple alternatives instead.

     This is called a "matching constraint" and what it really means is
     that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
     considered separate in the RTL insn.  For example, an add insn has
     two input operands and one output operand in the RTL, but on most
     CISC machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one
     of them an input-output operand:

          addl #35,r12

     Matching constraints are used in these circumstances.  More
     precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
     operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
     smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
     constraint.

     For operands to match in a particular case usually means that they
     are identical-looking RTL expressions.  But in a few special cases
     specific kinds of dissimilarity are allowed.  For example, `*x' as
     an input operand will match `*x++' as an output operand.  For
     proper results in such cases, the output template should always
     use the output-operand's number when printing the operand.

`p'
     An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is for
     "load address" and "push address" instructions.

     `p' in the constraint must be accompanied by `address_operand' as
     the predicate in the `match_operand'.  This predicate interprets
     the mode specified in the `match_operand' as the mode of the memory
     reference for which the address would be valid.

OTHER-LETTERS
     Other letters can be defined in machine-dependent fashion to stand
     for particular classes of registers or other arbitrary operand
     types.  `d', `a' and `f' are defined on the 68000/68020 to stand
     for data, address and floating point registers.

     The machine description macro `REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER' has first
     cut at the otherwise unused letters.  If it evaluates to `NO_REGS',
     then `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT' is evaluated.

     A typical use for `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT' would be to distinguish
     certain types of memory references that affect other insn operands.

   In order to have valid assembler code, each operand must satisfy its
constraint.  But a failure to do so does not prevent the pattern from
applying to an insn.  Instead, it directs the compiler to modify the
code so that the constraint will be satisfied.  Usually this is done by
copying an operand into a register.

   Contrast, therefore, the two instruction patterns that follow:

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
             (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
                      (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "...")

which has two operands, one of which must appear in two places, and

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "...")

which has three operands, two of which are required by a constraint to
be identical.  If we are considering an insn of the form

     (insn N PREV NEXT
       (set (reg:SI 3)
            (plus:SI (reg:SI 6) (reg:SI 109)))
       ...)

the first pattern would not apply at all, because this insn does not
contain two identical subexpressions in the right place.  The pattern
would say, "That does not look like an add instruction; try other
patterns."  The second pattern would say, "Yes, that's an add
instruction, but there is something wrong with it."  It would direct
the reload pass of the compiler to generate additional insns to make
the constraint true.  The results might look like this:

     (insn N2 PREV N
       (set (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 6))
       ...)

     (insn N N2 NEXT
       (set (reg:SI 3)
            (plus:SI (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 109)))
       ...)

   It is up to you to make sure that each operand, in each pattern, has
constraints that can handle any RTL expression that could be present for
that operand.  (When multiple alternatives are in use, each pattern
must, for each possible combination of operand expressions, have at
least one alternative which can handle that combination of operands.)
The constraints don't need to _allow_ any possible operand--when this is
the case, they do not constrain--but they must at least point the way to
reloading any possible operand so that it will fit.

   * If the constraint accepts whatever operands the predicate permits,
     there is no problem: reloading is never necessary for this operand.

     For example, an operand whose constraints permit everything except
     registers is safe provided its predicate rejects registers.

     An operand whose predicate accepts only constant values is safe
     provided its constraints include the letter `i'.  If any possible
     constant value is accepted, then nothing less than `i' will do; if
     the predicate is more selective, then the constraints may also be
     more selective.

   * Any operand expression can be reloaded by copying it into a
     register.  So if an operand's constraints allow some kind of
     register, it is certain to be safe.  It need not permit all
     classes of registers; the compiler knows how to copy a register
     into another register of the proper class in order to make an
     instruction valid.

   * A nonoffsettable memory reference can be reloaded by copying the
     address into a register.  So if the constraint uses the letter
     `o', all memory references are taken care of.

   * A constant operand can be reloaded by allocating space in memory to
     hold it as preinitialized data.  Then the memory reference can be
     used in place of the constant.  So if the constraint uses the
     letters `o' or `m', constant operands are not a problem.

   * If the constraint permits a constant and a pseudo register used in
     an insn was not allocated to a hard register and is equivalent to
     a constant, the register will be replaced with the constant.  If
     the predicate does not permit a constant and the insn is
     re-recognized for some reason, the compiler will crash.  Thus the
     predicate must always recognize any objects allowed by the
     constraint.

   If the operand's predicate can recognize registers, but the
constraint does not permit them, it can make the compiler crash.  When
this operand happens to be a register, the reload pass will be stymied,
because it does not know how to copy a register temporarily into memory.

   If the predicate accepts a unary operator, the constraint applies to
the operand.  For example, the MIPS processor at ISA level 3 supports an
instruction which adds two registers in `SImode' to produce a `DImode'
result, but only if the registers are correctly sign extended.  This
predicate for the input operands accepts a `sign_extend' of an `SImode'
register.  Write the constraint to indicate the type of register that
is required for the operand of the `sign_extend'.

10.7.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints
---------------------------------------

Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can
combine register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine
any kind of operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory
location into another.

   These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An
alternative can be described by a series of letters for each operand.
The overall constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this
operand from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this
operand from the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last
alternative.  Here is how it is done for fullword logical-or on the
68000:

     (define_insn "iorsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=m,d")
             (ior:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dKs,dmKs")))]
       ...)

   The first alternative has `m' (memory) for operand 0, `0' for
operand 1 (meaning it must match operand 0), and `dKs' for operand 2.
The second alternative has `d' (data register) for operand 0, `0' for
operand 1, and `dmKs' for operand 2.  The `=' and `%' in the
constraints apply to all the alternatives; their meaning is explained
in the next section (*note Class Preferences::).

   If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is
valid.  Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many
instructions must be added to copy the operands so that that
alternative applies.  The alternative requiring the least copying is
chosen.  If two alternatives need the same amount of copying, the one
that comes first is chosen.  These choices can be altered with the `?'
and `!' characters:

`?'
     Disparage slightly the alternative that the `?' appears in, as a
     choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
     this alternative as one unit more costly for each `?' that appears
     in it.

`!'
     Disparage severely the alternative that the `!' appears in.  This
     alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading, but if
     reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.

   When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints,
often the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which
alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code for writing the
assembler code can use the variable `which_alternative', which is the
ordinal number of the alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for
the first, 1 for the second alternative, etc.).  *Note Output
Statement::.

10.7.3 Register Class Preferences
---------------------------------

The operand constraints have another function: they enable the compiler
to decide which kind of hardware register a pseudo register is best
allocated to.  The compiler examines the constraints that apply to the
insns that use the pseudo register, looking for the machine-dependent
letters such as `d' and `a' that specify classes of registers.  The
pseudo register is put in whichever class gets the most "votes".  The
constraint letters `g' and `r' also vote: they vote in favor of a
general register.  The machine description says which registers are
considered general.

   Of course, on some machines all registers are equivalent, and no
register classes are defined.  Then none of this complexity is relevant.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Modifiers,  Next: Machine Constraints,  Prev: Class Preferences,  Up: Constraints

10.7.4 Constraint Modifier Characters
-------------------------------------

Here are constraint modifier characters.

`='
     Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the
     previous value is discarded and replaced by output data.

`+'
     Means that this operand is both read and written by the
     instruction.

     When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
     it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
     which are outputs from it.  `=' identifies an output; `+'
     identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other
     operands are assumed to be input only.

     If you specify `=' or `+' in a constraint, you put it in the first
     character of the constraint string.

`&'
     Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
     "earlyclobber" operand, which is modified before the instruction is
     finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may
     not lie in a register that is used as an input operand or as part
     of any memory address.

     `&' applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
     constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
     requires `&' while others do not.  See, for example, the `movdf'
     insn of the 68000.

     An input operand can be tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only
     use as an input occurs before the early result is written.  Adding
     alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce better code
     when only some of the inputs can be affected by the earlyclobber.
     See, for example, the `mulsi3' insn of the ARM.

     `&' does not obviate the need to write `='.

`%'
     Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
     following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange
     the two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands
     fit the constraints.  This is often used in patterns for addition
     instructions that really have only two operands: the result must
     go in one of the arguments.  Here for example, is how the 68000
     halfword-add instruction is defined:

          (define_insn "addhi3"
            [(set (match_operand:HI 0 "general_operand" "=m,r")
               (plus:HI (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                        (match_operand:HI 2 "general_operand" "di,g")))]
            ...)
     GCC can only handle one commutative pair in an asm; if you use
     more, the compiler may fail.  Note that you need not use the
     modifier if the two alternatives are strictly identical; this
     would only waste time in the reload pass.

`#'
     Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
     ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
     register preferences.

`*'
     Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
     register preferences.  `*' has no effect on the meaning of the
     constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.

     Here is an example: the 68000 has an instruction to sign-extend a
     halfword in a data register, and can also sign-extend a value by
     copying it into an address register.  While either kind of
     register is acceptable, the constraints on an address-register
     destination are less strict, so it is best if register allocation
     makes an address register its goal.  Therefore, `*' is used so
     that the `d' constraint letter (for data register) is ignored when
     computing register preferences.

          (define_insn "extendhisi2"
            [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=*d,a")
                  (sign_extend:SI
                   (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "0,g")))]
            ...)

10.7.5 Constraints for Particular Machines
------------------------------------------

Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint letters
in `asm' arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily to
people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters
that usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are `m' and `r' (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; *note Simple Constraints::), and
`I', usually the letter indicating the most common immediate-constant
format.

   For each machine architecture, the `config/MACHINE/MACHINE.h' file
defines additional constraints.  These constraints are used by the
compiler itself for instruction generation, as well as for `asm'
statements; therefore, some of the constraints are not particularly
interesting for `asm'.  The constraints are defined through these
macros:

`REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER'
     Register class constraints (usually lowercase).

`CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P'
     Immediate constant constraints, for non-floating point constants of
     word size or smaller precision (usually uppercase).

`CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P'
     Immediate constant constraints, for all floating point constants
     and for constants of greater than word size precision (usually
     uppercase).

`EXTRA_CONSTRAINT'
     Special cases of registers or memory.  This macro is not required,
     and is only defined for some machines.

   Inspecting these macro definitions in the compiler source for your
machine is the best way to be certain you have the right constraints.

10.8 Standard Pattern Names For Generation
==========================================

Here is a table of the instruction names that are meaningful in the RTL
generation pass of the compiler.  Giving one of these names to an
instruction pattern tells the RTL generation pass that it can use the
pattern to accomplish a certain task.

`movM'
     Here M stands for a two-letter machine mode name, in lowercase.
     This instruction pattern moves data with that machine mode from
     operand 1 to operand 0.  For example, `movsi' moves full-word data.

     If operand 0 is a `subreg' with mode M of a register whose own
     mode is wider than M, the effect of this instruction is to store
     the specified value in the part of the register that corresponds
     to mode M.  Bits outside of M, but which are within the same
     target word as the `subreg' are undefined.  Bits which are outside
     the target word are left unchanged.

     This class of patterns is special in several ways.  First of all,
     each of these names up to and including full word size _must_ be
     defined, because there is no other way to copy a datum from one
     place to another.  If there are patterns accepting operands in
     larger modes, `movM' must be defined for integer modes of those
     sizes.

     Second, these patterns are not used solely in the RTL generation
     pass.  Even the reload pass can generate move insns to copy values
     from stack slots into temporary registers.  When it does so, one
     of the operands is a hard register and the other is an operand
     that can need to be reloaded into a register.

     Therefore, when given such a pair of operands, the pattern must
     generate RTL which needs no reloading and needs no temporary
     registers--no registers other than the operands.  For example, if
     you support the pattern with a `define_expand', then in such a
     case the `define_expand' mustn't call `force_reg' or any other such
     function which might generate new pseudo registers.

     This requirement exists even for subword modes on a RISC machine
     where fetching those modes from memory normally requires several
     insns and some temporary registers.

     During reload a memory reference with an invalid address may be
     passed as an operand.  Such an address will be replaced with a
     valid address later in the reload pass.  In this case, nothing may
     be done with the address except to use it as it stands.  If it is
     copied, it will not be replaced with a valid address.  No attempt
     should be made to make such an address into a valid address and no
     routine (such as `change_address') that will do so may be called.
     Note that `general_operand' will fail when applied to such an
     address.

     The global variable `reload_in_progress' (which must be explicitly
     declared if required) can be used to determine whether such special
     handling is required.

     The variety of operands that have reloads depends on the rest of
     the machine description, but typically on a RISC machine these can
     only be pseudo registers that did not get hard registers, while on
     other machines explicit memory references will get optional
     reloads.

     If a scratch register is required to move an object to or from
     memory, it can be allocated using `gen_reg_rtx' prior to life
     analysis.

     If there are cases which need scratch registers during or after
     reload, you must define `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' and/or
     `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to detect them, and provide
     patterns `reload_inM' or `reload_outM' to handle them.  *Note
     Register Classes::.

     The global variable `no_new_pseudos' can be used to determine if it
     is unsafe to create new pseudo registers.  If this variable is
     nonzero, then it is unsafe to call `gen_reg_rtx' to allocate a new
     pseudo.

     The constraints on a `movM' must permit moving any hard register
     to any other hard register provided that `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
     permits mode M in both registers and `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied
     to their classes returns a value of 2.

     It is obligatory to support floating point `movM' instructions
     into and out of any registers that can hold fixed point values,
     because unions and structures (which have modes `SImode' or
     `DImode') can be in those registers and they may have floating
     point members.

     There may also be a need to support fixed point `movM'
     instructions in and out of floating point registers.
     Unfortunately, I have forgotten why this was so, and I don't know
     whether it is still true.  If `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' rejects fixed
     point values in floating point registers, then the constraints of
     the fixed point `movM' instructions must be designed to avoid ever
     trying to reload into a floating point register.

`reload_inM'
`reload_outM'
     Like `movM', but used when a scratch register is required to move
     between operand 0 and operand 1.  Operand 2 describes the scratch
     register.  See the discussion of the `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS'
     macro in *note Register Classes::.

     There are special restrictions on the form of the `match_operand's
     used in these patterns.  First, only the predicate for the reload
     operand is examined, i.e., `reload_in' examines operand 1, but not
     the predicates for operand 0 or 2.  Second, there may be only one
     alternative in the constraints.  Third, only a single register
     class letter may be used for the constraint; subsequent constraint
     letters are ignored.  As a special exception, an empty constraint
     string matches the `ALL_REGS' register class.  This may relieve
     ports of the burden of defining an `ALL_REGS' constraint letter
     just for these patterns.

`movstrictM'
     Like `movM' except that if operand 0 is a `subreg' with mode M of
     a register whose natural mode is wider, the `movstrictM'
     instruction is guaranteed not to alter any of the register except
     the part which belongs to mode M.

`load_multiple'
     Load several consecutive memory locations into consecutive
     registers.  Operand 0 is the first of the consecutive registers,
     operand 1 is the first memory location, and operand 2 is a
     constant: the number of consecutive registers.

     Define this only if the target machine really has such an
     instruction; do not define this if the most efficient way of
     loading consecutive registers from memory is to do them one at a
     time.

     On some machines, there are restrictions as to which consecutive
     registers can be stored into memory, such as particular starting or
     ending register numbers or only a range of valid counts.  For those
     machines, use a `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) and
     make the pattern fail if the restrictions are not met.

     Write the generated insn as a `parallel' with elements being a
     `set' of one register from the appropriate memory location (you may
     also need `use' or `clobber' elements).  Use a `match_parallel'
     (*note RTL Template::) to recognize the insn.  See `rs6000.md' for
     examples of the use of this insn pattern.

`store_multiple'
     Similar to `load_multiple', but store several consecutive registers
     into consecutive memory locations.  Operand 0 is the first of the
     consecutive memory locations, operand 1 is the first register, and
     operand 2 is a constant: the number of consecutive registers.

`pushM'
     Output a push instruction.  Operand 0 is value to push.  Used only
     when `PUSH_ROUNDING' is defined.  For historical reason, this
     pattern may be missing and in such case an `mov' expander is used
     instead, with a `MEM' expression forming the push operation.  The
     `mov' expander method is deprecated.

`addM3'
     Add operand 2 and operand 1, storing the result in operand 0.  All
     operands must have mode M.  This can be used even on two-address
     machines, by means of constraints requiring operands 1 and 0 to be
     the same location.

`subM3', `mulM3'
`divM3', `udivM3', `modM3', `umodM3'
`sminM3', `smaxM3', `uminM3', `umaxM3'
`andM3', `iorM3', `xorM3'
     Similar, for other arithmetic operations.  

`minM3', `maxM3'
     Floating point min and max operations.  If both operands are zeros,
     or if either operand is NaN, then it is unspecified which of the
     two operands is returned as the result.

`mulhisi3'
     Multiply operands 1 and 2, which have mode `HImode', and store a
     `SImode' product in operand 0.

`mulqihi3', `mulsidi3'
     Similar widening-multiplication instructions of other widths.

`umulqihi3', `umulhisi3', `umulsidi3'
     Similar widening-multiplication instructions that do unsigned
     multiplication.

`smulM3_highpart'
     Perform a signed multiplication of operands 1 and 2, which have
     mode M, and store the most significant half of the product in
     operand 0.  The least significant half of the product is discarded.

`umulM3_highpart'
     Similar, but the multiplication is unsigned.

`divmodM4'
     Signed division that produces both a quotient and a remainder.
     Operand 1 is divided by operand 2 to produce a quotient stored in
     operand 0 and a remainder stored in operand 3.

     For machines with an instruction that produces both a quotient and
     a remainder, provide a pattern for `divmodM4' but do not provide
     patterns for `divM3' and `modM3'.  This allows optimization in the
     relatively common case when both the quotient and remainder are
     computed.

     If an instruction that just produces a quotient or just a remainder
     exists and is more efficient than the instruction that produces
     both, write the output routine of `divmodM4' to call
     `find_reg_note' and look for a `REG_UNUSED' note on the quotient
     or remainder and generate the appropriate instruction.

`udivmodM4'
     Similar, but does unsigned division.

`ashlM3'
     Arithmetic-shift operand 1 left by a number of bits specified by
     operand 2, and store the result in operand 0.  Here M is the mode
     of operand 0 and operand 1; operand 2's mode is specified by the
     instruction pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to
     that mode before generating the instruction.

`ashrM3', `lshrM3', `rotlM3', `rotrM3'
     Other shift and rotate instructions, analogous to the `ashlM3'
     instructions.

     Negate operand 1 and store the result in operand 0.

     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type

     operand 0.

     The `pow' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type `double' and the `powf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     `float'.

`atan2M3'
     Store the arc tangent (inverse tangent) of operand 1 divided by
     operand 2 into operand 0, using the signs of both arguments to
     determine the quadrant of the result.

     The `atan2' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type `double' and the `atan2f' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     `float'.

`floorM2'
     Store the largest integral value not greater than argument.

     The `floor' built-in function of C always uses the mode which

     corresponds to the C data type `double' and the `nearbyintf'
     built-in function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data
     type `float'.

`ffsM2'
     Store into operand 0 one plus the index of the least significant
     1-bit of operand 1.  If operand 1 is zero, store zero.  M is the
     mode of operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
     pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode
     before generating the instruction.

     The `ffs' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type `int'.

`clzM2'
     Store into operand 0 the number of leading 0-bits in X, starting
     at the most significant bit position.  If X is 0, the result is
     undefined.  M is the mode of operand 0; operand 1's mode is
     specified by the instruction pattern, and the compiler will
     convert the operand to that mode before generating the instruction.

`ctzM2'
     Store into operand 0 the number of trailing 0-bits in X, starting
     at the least significant bit position.  If X is 0, the result is
     undefined.  M is the mode of operand 0; operand 1's mode is
     specified by the instruction pattern, and the compiler will
     convert the operand to that mode before generating the instruction.

`popcountM2'
     Store into operand 0 the number of 1-bits in X.  M is the mode of
     operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
     pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode
     before generating the instruction.

`parityM2'
     Store into operand 0 the parity of X, i.e. the number of 1-bits in
     X modulo 2.  M is the mode of operand 0; operand 1's mode is
     specified by the instruction pattern, and the compiler will convert
     the operand to that mode before generating the instruction.

`one_cmplM2'
     Store the bitwise-complement of operand 1 into operand 0.

`cmpM'
     Compare operand 0 and operand 1, and set the condition codes.  The
     RTL pattern should look like this:

          (set (cc0) (compare (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                              (match_operand:M 1 ...)))

`tstM'
     Compare operand 0 against zero, and set the condition codes.  The
     RTL pattern should look like this:

          (set (cc0) (match_operand:M 0 ...))

     `tstM' patterns should not be defined for machines that do not use
     `(cc0)'.  Doing so would confuse the optimizer since it would no
     longer be clear which `set' operations were comparisons.  The
     `cmpM' patterns should be used instead.

`movstrM'
     Block move instruction.  The addresses of the destination and
     source strings are the first two operands, and both are in mode
     `Pmode'.

     The number of bytes to move is the third operand, in mode M.
     Usually, you specify `word_mode' for M.  However, if you can
     generate better code knowing the range of valid lengths is smaller
     than those representable in a full word, you should provide a
     pattern with a mode corresponding to the range of values you can
     handle efficiently (e.g., `QImode' for values in the range 0-127;
     note we avoid numbers that appear negative) and also a pattern
     with `word_mode'.

     The fourth operand is the known shared alignment of the source and
     destination, in the form of a `const_int' rtx.  Thus, if the
     compiler knows that both source and destination are word-aligned,
     it may provide the value 4 for this operand.

     Descriptions of multiple `movstrM' patterns can only be beneficial
     if the patterns for smaller modes have fewer restrictions on their
     first, second and fourth operands.  Note that the mode M in
     `movstrM' does not impose any restriction on the mode of
     individually moved data units in the block.

     These patterns need not give special consideration to the
     possibility that the source and destination strings might overlap.

`clrstrM'
     Block clear instruction.  The addresses of the destination string
     is the first operand, in mode `Pmode'.  The number of bytes to
     clear is the second operand, in mode M.  See `movstrM' for a
     discussion of the choice of mode.

     The third operand is the known alignment of the destination, in
     the form of a `const_int' rtx.  Thus, if the compiler knows that
     the destination is word-aligned, it may provide the value 4 for
     this operand.

     The use for multiple `clrstrM' is as for `movstrM'.

`cmpstrM'
     String compare instruction, with five operands.  Operand 0 is the
     output; it has mode M.  The remaining four operands are like the
     operands of `movstrM'.  The two memory blocks specified are
     compared byte by byte in lexicographic order starting at the
     beginning of each string.  The instruction is not allowed to
     prefetch more than one byte at a time since either string may end
     in the first byte and reading past that may access an invalid page
     or segment and cause a fault.  The effect of the instruction is to
     store a value in operand 0 whose sign indicates the result of the
     comparison.

`cmpmemM'
     Block compare instruction, with five operands like the operands of
     `cmpstrM'.  The two memory blocks specified are compared byte by
     byte in lexicographic order starting at the beginning of each
     block.  Unlike `cmpstrM' the instruction can prefetch any bytes in
     the two memory blocks.  The effect of the instruction is to store
     a value in operand 0 whose sign indicates the result of the
     comparison.

`strlenM'
     Compute the length of a string, with three operands.  Operand 0 is
     the result (of mode M), operand 1 is a `mem' referring to the
     first character of the string, operand 2 is the character to
     search for (normally zero), and operand 3 is a constant describing
     the known alignment of the beginning of the string.

`floatMN2'
     Convert signed integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode M) to
     floating point mode N and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).

`floatunsMN2'
     Convert unsigned integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode M)
     to floating point mode N and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).

`fixMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as a signed number and store in operand 0 (which has mode
     N).  This instruction's result is defined only when the value of
     operand 1 is an integer.

`fixunsMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as an unsigned number and store in operand 0 (which has
     mode N).  This instruction's result is defined only when the value
     of operand 1 is an integer.

`ftruncM2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to an integer
     value, still represented in floating point mode M, and store it in
     operand 0 (valid for floating point mode M).

`fix_truncMN2'
     Like `fixMN2' but works for any floating point value of mode M by
     converting the value to an integer.

`fixuns_truncMN2'
     Like `fixunsMN2' but works for any floating point value of mode M
     by converting the value to an integer.

`truncMN2'
     Truncate operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point or
     both floating point.

`extendMN2'
     Sign-extend operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point or
     both floating point.

`zero_extendMN2'
     Zero-extend operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point.

`extv'
     Extract a bit-field from operand 1 (a register or memory operand),
     where operand 2 specifies the width in bits and operand 3 the
     starting bit, and store it in operand 0.  Operand 0 must have mode
     `word_mode'.  Operand 1 may have mode `byte_mode' or `word_mode';
     often `word_mode' is allowed only for registers.  Operands 2 and 3
     must be valid for `word_mode'.

     The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with
     constants for operands 2 and 3.

     The bit-field value is sign-extended to a full word integer before
     it is stored in operand 0.

`extzv'
     Like `extv' except that the bit-field value is zero-extended.

`insv'
     Store operand 3 (which must be valid for `word_mode') into a
     bit-field in operand 0, where operand 1 specifies the width in
     bits and operand 2 the starting bit.  Operand 0 may have mode
     `byte_mode' or `word_mode'; often `word_mode' is allowed only for
     registers.  Operands 1 and 2 must be valid for `word_mode'.

     The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with
     constants for operands 1 and 2.

`movMODEcc'
     Conditionally move operand 2 or operand 3 into operand 0 according
     to the comparison in operand 1.  If the comparison is true,
     operand 2 is moved into operand 0, otherwise operand 3 is moved.

     The mode of the operands being compared need not be the same as
     the operands being moved.  Some machines, sparc64 for example,
     have instructions that conditionally move an integer value based
     on the floating point condition codes and vice versa.

     If the machine does not have conditional move instructions, do not
     define these patterns.

`addMODEcc'
     Similar to `movMODEcc' but for conditional addition.  Conditionally
     move operand 2 or (operands 2 + operand 3) into operand 0
     according to the comparison in operand 1.  If the comparison is
     true, operand 2 is moved into operand 0, otherwise (operand 2 +
     operand 3) is moved.

`sCOND'
     Store zero or nonzero in the operand according to the condition
     codes.  Value stored is nonzero iff the condition COND is true.
     COND is the name of a comparison operation expression code, such
     as `eq', `lt' or `leu'.

     You specify the mode that the operand must have when you write the
     `match_operand' expression.  The compiler automatically sees which
     mode you have used and supplies an operand of that mode.

     The value stored for a true condition must have 1 as its low bit,
     or else must be negative.  Otherwise the instruction is not
     suitable and you should omit it from the machine description.  You
     describe to the compiler exactly which value is stored by defining
     the macro `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::).  If a description
     cannot be found that can be used for all the `sCOND' patterns, you
     should omit those operations from the machine description.

     These operations may fail, but should do so only in relatively
     uncommon cases; if they would fail for common cases involving
     integer comparisons, it is best to omit these patterns.

     If these operations are omitted, the compiler will usually
     generate code that copies the constant one to the target and
     branches around an assignment of zero to the target.  If this code
     is more efficient than the potential instructions used for the
     `sCOND' pattern followed by those required to convert the result
     into a 1 or a zero in `SImode', you should omit the `sCOND'
     operations from the machine description.

`bCOND'
     Conditional branch instruction.  Operand 0 is a `label_ref' that
     refers to the label to jump to.  Jump if the condition codes meet
     condition COND.

     Some machines do not follow the model assumed here where a
     comparison instruction is followed by a conditional branch
     instruction.  In that case, the `cmpM' (and `tstM') patterns should
     simply store the operands away and generate all the required insns
     in a `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) for the
     conditional branch operations.  All calls to expand `bCOND'
     patterns are immediately preceded by calls to expand either a
     `cmpM' pattern or a `tstM' pattern.

     Machines that use a pseudo register for the condition code value,
     or where the mode used for the comparison depends on the condition
     being tested, should also use the above mechanism.  *Note Jump
     Patterns::.

     The above discussion also applies to the `movMODEcc' and `sCOND'
     patterns.

`jump'
     A jump inside a function; an unconditional branch.  Operand 0 is
     the `label_ref' of the label to jump to.  This pattern name is
     mandatory on all machines.

`call'
     Subroutine call instruction returning no value.  Operand 0 is the
     function to call; operand 1 is the number of bytes of arguments
     pushed as a `const_int'; operand 2 is the number of registers used
     as operands.

     On most machines, operand 2 is not actually stored into the RTL
     pattern.  It is supplied for the sake of some RISC machines which
     need to put this information into the assembler code; they can put
     it in the RTL instead of operand 1.

     Operand 0 should be a `mem' RTX whose address is the address of the
     function.  Note, however, that this address can be a `symbol_ref'
     expression even if it would not be a legitimate memory address on
     the target machine.  If it is also not a valid argument for a call
     instruction, the pattern for this operation should be a
     `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) that places the
     address into a register and uses that register in the call
     instruction.

`call_value'
     Subroutine call instruction returning a value.  Operand 0 is the
     hard register in which the value is returned.  There are three more
     operands, the same as the three operands of the `call' instruction
     (but with numbers increased by one).

     Subroutines that return `BLKmode' objects use the `call' insn.

`call_pop', `call_value_pop'
     Similar to `call' and `call_value', except used if defined and if
     `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' is nonzero.  They should emit a `parallel' that
     contains both the function call and a `set' to indicate the
     adjustment made to the frame pointer.

     For machines where `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' can be nonzero, the use of
     these patterns increases the number of functions for which the
     frame pointer can be eliminated, if desired.

`untyped_call'
     Subroutine call instruction returning a value of any type.
     Operand 0 is the function to call; operand 1 is a memory location
     where the result of calling the function is to be stored; operand
     2 is a `parallel' expression where each element is a `set'
     expression that indicates the saving of a function return value
     into the result block.

     This instruction pattern should be defined to support
     `__builtin_apply' on machines where special instructions are needed
     to call a subroutine with arbitrary arguments or to save the value
     returned.  This instruction pattern is required on machines that
     have multiple registers that can hold a return value (i.e.
     `FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' is true for more than one register).

`return'
     Subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern name
     should be defined only if a single instruction can do all the work
     of returning from a function.

     Like the `movM' patterns, this pattern is also used after the RTL
     generation phase.  In this case it is to support machines where
     multiple instructions are usually needed to return from a
     function, but some class of functions only requires one
     instruction to implement a return.  Normally, the applicable
     functions are those which do not need to save any registers or
     allocate stack space.

     For such machines, the condition specified in this pattern should
     only be true when `reload_completed' is nonzero and the function's
     epilogue would only be a single instruction.  For machines with
     register windows, the routine `leaf_function_p' may be used to
     determine if a register window push is required.

     Machines that have conditional return instructions should define
     patterns such as

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (pc)
                  (if_then_else (match_operator
                                   0 "comparison_operator"
                                   [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                                (return)
                                (pc)))]
            "CONDITION"
            "...")

     where CONDITION would normally be the same condition specified on
     the named `return' pattern.

`untyped_return'
     Untyped subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern
     should be defined to support `__builtin_return' on machines where
     special instructions are needed to return a value of any type.

     Operand 0 is a memory location where the result of calling a
     function with `__builtin_apply' is stored; operand 1 is a
     `parallel' expression where each element is a `set' expression
     that indicates the restoring of a function return value from the
     result block.

`nop'
     No-op instruction.  This instruction pattern name should always be
     defined to output a no-op in assembler code.  `(const_int 0)' will
     do as an RTL pattern.

`indirect_jump'
     An instruction to jump to an address which is operand zero.  This
     pattern name is mandatory on all machines.

`casesi'
     Instruction to jump through a dispatch table, including bounds
     checking.  This instruction takes five operands:

       1. The index to dispatch on, which has mode `SImode'.

       2. The lower bound for indices in the table, an integer constant.

       3. The total range of indices in the table--the largest index
          minus the smallest one (both inclusive).

       4. A label that precedes the table itself.

       5. A label to jump to if the index has a value outside the
          bounds.  (If the machine-description macro
          `CASE_DROPS_THROUGH' is defined, then an out-of-bounds index
          drops through to the code following the jump table instead of
          jumping to this label.  In that case, this label is not
          actually used by the `casesi' instruction, but it is always
          provided as an operand.)

     The table is a `addr_vec' or `addr_diff_vec' inside of a
     `jump_insn'.  The number of elements in the table is one plus the
     difference between the upper bound and the lower bound.

`tablejump'
     Instruction to jump to a variable address.  This is a low-level
     capability which can be used to implement a dispatch table when
     there is no `casesi' pattern.

     This pattern requires two operands: the address or offset, and a
     label which should immediately precede the jump table.  If the
     macro `CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE' evaluates to a nonzero value then
     the first operand is an offset which counts from the address of
     the table; otherwise, it is an absolute address to jump to.  In
     either case, the first operand has mode `Pmode'.

     The `tablejump' insn is always the last insn before the jump table
     it uses.  Its assembler code normally has no need to use the
     second operand, but you should incorporate it in the RTL pattern so
     that the jump optimizer will not delete the table as unreachable
     code.

`decrement_and_branch_until_zero'
     Conditional branch instruction that decrements a register and
     jumps if the register is nonzero.  Operand 0 is the register to
     decrement and test; operand 1 is the label to jump to if the
     register is nonzero.  *Note Looping Patterns::.

     This optional instruction pattern is only used by the combiner,
     typically for loops reversed by the loop optimizer when strength
     reduction is enabled.

`doloop_end'
     Conditional branch instruction that decrements a register and
     jumps if the register is nonzero.  This instruction takes five
     operands: Operand 0 is the register to decrement and test; operand
     1 is the number of loop iterations as a `const_int' or
     `const0_rtx' if this cannot be determined until run-time; operand
     2 is the actual or estimated maximum number of iterations as a
     `const_int'; operand 3 is the number of enclosed loops as a
     `const_int' (an innermost loop has a value of 1); operand 4 is the
     label to jump to if the register is nonzero.  *Note Looping
     Patterns::.

     This optional instruction pattern should be defined for machines
     with low-overhead looping instructions as the loop optimizer will
     try to modify suitable loops to utilize it.  If nested
     low-overhead looping is not supported, use a `define_expand'
     (*note Expander Definitions::) and make the pattern fail if
     operand 3 is not `const1_rtx'.  Similarly, if the actual or
     estimated maximum number of iterations is too large for this
     instruction, make it fail.

`doloop_begin'
     Companion instruction to `doloop_end' required for machines that
     need to perform some initialization, such as loading special
     registers used by a low-overhead looping instruction.  If
     initialization insns do not always need to be emitted, use a
     `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) and make it fail.

`canonicalize_funcptr_for_compare'
     Canonicalize the function pointer in operand 1 and store the result
     into operand 0.

     Operand 0 is always a `reg' and has mode `Pmode'; operand 1 may be
     a `reg', `mem', `symbol_ref', `const_int', etc and also has mode
     `Pmode'.

     Canonicalization of a function pointer usually involves computing
     the address of the function which would be called if the function
     pointer were used in an indirect call.

     Only define this pattern if function pointers on the target machine
     can have different values but still call the same function when
     used in an indirect call.

`save_stack_block'
`save_stack_function'
`save_stack_nonlocal'
`restore_stack_block'
`restore_stack_function'
`restore_stack_nonlocal'
     Most machines save and restore the stack pointer by copying it to
     or from an object of mode `Pmode'.  Do not define these patterns on
     such machines.

     Some machines require special handling for stack pointer saves and
     restores.  On those machines, define the patterns corresponding to
     the non-standard cases by using a `define_expand' (*note Expander
     Definitions::) that produces the required insns.  The three types
     of saves and restores are:

       1. `save_stack_block' saves the stack pointer at the start of a
          block that allocates a variable-sized object, and
          `restore_stack_block' restores the stack pointer when the
          block is exited.

       2. `save_stack_function' and `restore_stack_function' do a
          similar job for the outermost block of a function and are
          used when the function allocates variable-sized objects or
          calls `alloca'.  Only the epilogue uses the restored stack
          pointer, allowing a simpler save or restore sequence on some
          machines.

       3. `save_stack_nonlocal' is used in functions that contain labels
          branched to by nested functions.  It saves the stack pointer
          in such a way that the inner function can use
          `restore_stack_nonlocal' to restore the stack pointer.  The
          compiler generates code to restore the frame and argument
          pointer registers, but some machines require saving and
          restoring additional data such as register window information
          or stack backchains.  Place insns in these patterns to save
          and restore any such required data.

     When saving the stack pointer, operand 0 is the save area and
     operand 1 is the stack pointer.  The mode used to allocate the
     save area defaults to `Pmode' but you can override that choice by
     defining the `STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE' macro (*note Storage Layout::).
     You must specify an integral mode, or `VOIDmode' if no save area
     is needed for a particular type of save (either because no save is
     needed or because a machine-specific save area can be used).
     Operand 0 is the stack pointer and operand 1 is the save area for
     restore operations.  If `save_stack_block' is defined, operand 0
     must not be `VOIDmode' since these saves can be arbitrarily nested.

     A save area is a `mem' that is at a constant offset from
     `virtual_stack_vars_rtx' when the stack pointer is saved for use by
     nonlocal gotos and a `reg' in the other two cases.

`allocate_stack'
     Subtract (or add if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is undefined) operand 1
     from the stack pointer to create space for dynamically allocated
     data.

     Store the resultant pointer to this space into operand 0.  If you
     are allocating space from the main stack, do this by emitting a
     move insn to copy `virtual_stack_dynamic_rtx' to operand 0.  If
     you are allocating the space elsewhere, generate code to copy the
     location of the space to operand 0.  In the latter case, you must
     ensure this space gets freed when the corresponding space on the
     main stack is free.

     Do not define this pattern if all that must be done is the
     subtraction.  Some machines require other operations such as stack
     probes or maintaining the back chain.  Define this pattern to emit
     those operations in addition to updating the stack pointer.

`check_stack'
     If stack checking cannot be done on your system by probing the
     stack with a load or store instruction (*note Stack Checking::),
     define this pattern to perform the needed check and signaling an
     error if the stack has overflowed.  The single operand is the
     location in the stack furthest from the current stack pointer that
     you need to validate.  Normally, on machines where this pattern is
     needed, you would obtain the stack limit from a global or
     thread-specific variable or register.

`nonlocal_goto'
     Emit code to generate a non-local goto, e.g., a jump from one
     function to a label in an outer function.  This pattern has four
     arguments, each representing a value to be used in the jump.  The
     first argument is to be loaded into the frame pointer, the second
     is the address to branch to (code to dispatch to the actual label),
     the third is the address of a location where the stack is saved,
     and the last is the address of the label, to be placed in the
     location for the incoming static chain.

     On most machines you need not define this pattern, since GCC will
     already generate the correct code, which is to load the frame
     pointer and static chain, restore the stack (using the
     `restore_stack_nonlocal' pattern, if defined), and jump indirectly
     to the dispatcher.  You need only define this pattern if this code
     will not work on your machine.

`nonlocal_goto_receiver'
     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the target of a
     nonlocal goto after the code already generated by GCC.  You will
     not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical reason why
     you might need this pattern is if some value, such as a pointer to
     a global table, must be restored when the frame pointer is
     restored.  Note that a nonlocal goto only occurs within a
     unit-of-translation, so a global table pointer that is shared by
     all functions of a given module need not be restored.  There are
     no arguments.

`exception_receiver'
     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the site of an
     exception handler that isn't needed at the site of a nonlocal
     goto.  You will not normally need to define this pattern.  A
     typical reason why you might need this pattern is if some value,
     such as a pointer to a global table, must be restored after
     control flow is branched to the handler of an exception.  There
     are no arguments.

`builtin_setjmp_setup'
     This pattern, if defined, contains additional code needed to
     initialize the `jmp_buf'.  You will not normally need to define
     this pattern.  A typical reason why you might need this pattern is
     if some value, such as a pointer to a global table, must be
     restored.  Though it is preferred that the pointer value be
     recalculated if possible (given the address of a label for
     instance).  The single argument is a pointer to the `jmp_buf'.
     Note that the buffer is five words long and that the first three
     are normally used by the generic mechanism.

`builtin_setjmp_receiver'
     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the site of an
     built-in setjmp that isn't needed at the site of a nonlocal goto.
     You will not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical
     reason why you might need this pattern is if some value, such as a
     pointer to a global table, must be restored.  It takes one
     argument, which is the label to which builtin_longjmp transfered
     control; this pattern may be emitted at a small offset from that
     label.

`builtin_longjmp'
     This pattern, if defined, performs the entire action of the
     longjmp.  You will not normally need to define this pattern unless
     you also define `builtin_setjmp_setup'.  The single argument is a
     pointer to the `jmp_buf'.

`eh_return'
     This pattern, if defined, affects the way `__builtin_eh_return',
     and thence the call frame exception handling library routines, are
     built.  It is intended to handle non-trivial actions needed along
     the abnormal return path.

     The address of the exception handler to which the function should
     return is passed as operand to this pattern.  It will normally
     need to copied by the pattern to some special register or memory
     location.  If the pattern needs to determine the location of the
     target call frame in order to do so, it may use
     `EH_RETURN_STACKADJ_RTX', if defined; it will have already been
     assigned.

     If this pattern is not defined, the default action will be to
     simply copy the return address to `EH_RETURN_HANDLER_RTX'.  Either
     that macro or this pattern needs to be defined if call frame
     exception handling is to be used.

`prologue'
     This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for entry to a function.  The
     function entry is responsible for setting up the stack frame,
     initializing the frame pointer register, saving callee saved
     registers, etc.

     Using a prologue pattern is generally preferred over defining
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' to emit assembly code for the
     prologue.

     The `prologue' pattern is particularly useful for targets which
     perform instruction scheduling.

`epilogue'
     This pattern emits RTL for exit from a function.  The function
     exit is responsible for deallocating the stack frame, restoring
     callee saved registers and emitting the return instruction.

     Using an epilogue pattern is generally preferred over defining
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to emit assembly code for the
     epilogue.

     The `epilogue' pattern is particularly useful for targets which
     perform instruction scheduling or which have delay slots for their
     return instruction.

`sibcall_epilogue'
     This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for exit from a function
     without the final branch back to the calling function.  This
     pattern will be emitted before any sibling call (aka tail call)
     sites.

     The `sibcall_epilogue' pattern must not clobber any arguments used
     for parameter passing or any stack slots for arguments passed to
     the current function.

`trap'
     This pattern, if defined, signals an error, typically by causing
     some kind of signal to be raised.  Among other places, it is used
     by the Java front end to signal `invalid array index' exceptions.

`conditional_trap'
     Conditional trap instruction.  Operand 0 is a piece of RTL which
     performs a comparison.  Operand 1 is the trap code, an integer.

     A typical `conditional_trap' pattern looks like

          (define_insn "conditional_trap"
            [(trap_if (match_operator 0 "trap_operator"
                       [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                      (match_operand 1 "const_int_operand" "i"))]
            ""
            "...")

`prefetch'
     This pattern, if defined, emits code for a non-faulting data
     prefetch instruction.  Operand 0 is the address of the memory to
     prefetch.  Operand 1 is a constant 1 if the prefetch is preparing
     for a write to the memory address, or a constant 0 otherwise.
     Operand 2 is the expected degree of temporal locality of the data
     and is a value between 0 and 3, inclusive; 0 means that the data
     has no temporal locality, so it need not be left in the cache
     after the access; 3 means that the data has a high degree of
     temporal locality and should be left in all levels of cache
     possible;  1 and 2 mean, respectively, a low or moderate degree of
     temporal locality.

     Targets that do not support write prefetches or locality hints can
     ignore the values of operands 1 and 2.

10.9 When the Order of Patterns Matters
=======================================

Sometimes an insn can match more than one instruction pattern.  Then the
pattern that appears first in the machine description is the one used.
Therefore, more specific patterns (patterns that will match fewer
things) and faster instructions (those that will produce better code
when they do match) should usually go first in the description.

   In some cases the effect of ordering the patterns can be used to hide
a pattern when it is not valid.  For example, the 68000 has an
instruction for converting a fullword to floating point and another for
converting a byte to floating point.  An instruction converting an
integer to floating point could match either one.  We put the pattern
to convert the fullword first to make sure that one will be used rather
than the other.  (Otherwise a large integer might be generated as a
single-byte immediate quantity, which would not work.)  Instead of
using this pattern ordering it would be possible to make the pattern
for convert-a-byte smart enough to deal properly with any constant
value.

10.10 Interdependence of Patterns
=================================

Every machine description must have a named pattern for each of the
conditional branch names `bCOND'.  The recognition template must always
have the form

     (set (pc)
          (if_then_else (COND (cc0) (const_int 0))
                        (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))
                        (pc)))

In addition, every machine description must have an anonymous pattern
for each of the possible reverse-conditional branches.  Their templates
look like

     (set (pc)
          (if_then_else (COND (cc0) (const_int 0))
                        (pc)
                        (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))))

They are necessary because jump optimization can turn direct-conditional
branches into reverse-conditional branches.

   It is often convenient to use the `match_operator' construct to
reduce the number of patterns that must be specified for branches.  For
example,

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (pc)
             (if_then_else (match_operator 0 "comparison_operator"
                                           [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                           (pc)
                           (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))))]
       "CONDITION"
       "...")

   In some cases machines support instructions identical except for the
machine mode of one or more operands.  For example, there may be
"sign-extend halfword" and "sign-extend byte" instructions whose
patterns are

     (set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)
          (extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 ...)))

     (set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)
          (extend:SI (match_operand:QI 1 ...)))

Constant integers do not specify a machine mode, so an instruction to
extend a constant value could match either pattern.  The pattern it
actually will match is the one that appears first in the file.  For
correct results, this must be the one for the widest possible mode
(`HImode', here).  If the pattern matches the `QImode' instruction, the
results will be incorrect if the constant value does not actually fit
that mode.

   Such instructions to extend constants are rarely generated because
they are optimized away, but they do occasionally happen in nonoptimized
compilations.

   If a constraint in a pattern allows a constant, the reload pass may
replace a register with a constant permitted by the constraint in some
cases.  Similarly for memory references.  Because of this substitution,
you should not provide separate patterns for increment and decrement
instructions.  Instead, they should be generated from the same pattern
that supports register-register add insns by examining the operands and
generating the appropriate machine instruction.

10.11 Defining Jump Instruction Patterns
========================================

For most machines, GCC assumes that the machine has a condition code.
A comparison insn sets the condition code, recording the results of both
signed and unsigned comparison of the given operands.  A separate branch
insn tests the condition code and branches or not according its value.
The branch insns come in distinct signed and unsigned flavors.  Many
common machines, such as the VAX, the 68000 and the 32000, work this
way.

   Some machines have distinct signed and unsigned compare
instructions, and only one set of conditional branch instructions.  The
easiest way to handle these machines is to treat them just like the
others until the final stage where assembly code is written.  At this
time, when outputting code for the compare instruction, peek ahead at
the following branch using `next_cc0_user (insn)'.  (The variable
`insn' refers to the insn being output, in the output-writing code in
an instruction pattern.)  If the RTL says that is an unsigned branch,
output an unsigned compare; otherwise output a signed compare.  When
the branch itself is output, you can treat signed and unsigned branches
identically.

   The reason you can do this is that GCC always generates a pair of
consecutive RTL insns, possibly separated by `note' insns, one to set
the condition code and one to test it, and keeps the pair inviolate
until the end.

   To go with this technique, you must define the machine-description
macro `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to do `CC_STATUS_INIT'; in other words, no
compare instruction is superfluous.

   Some machines have compare-and-branch instructions and no condition
code.  A similar technique works for them.  When it is time to "output"
a compare instruction, record its operands in two static variables.
When outputting the branch-on-condition-code instruction that follows,
actually output a compare-and-branch instruction that uses the
remembered operands.

   It also works to define patterns for compare-and-branch instructions.
In optimizing compilation, the pair of compare and branch instructions
will be combined according to these patterns.  But this does not happen
if optimization is not requested.  So you must use one of the solutions
above in addition to any special patterns you define.

   In many RISC machines, most instructions do not affect the condition
code and there may not even be a separate condition code register.  On
these machines, the restriction that the definition and use of the
condition code be adjacent insns is not necessary and can prevent
important optimizations.  For example, on the IBM RS/6000, there is a
delay for taken branches unless the condition code register is set three
instructions earlier than the conditional branch.  The instruction
scheduler cannot perform this optimization if it is not permitted to
separate the definition and use of the condition code register.

   On these machines, do not use `(cc0)', but instead use a register to
represent the condition code.  If there is a specific condition code
register in the machine, use a hard register.  If the condition code or
comparison result can be placed in any general register, or if there are
multiple condition registers, use a pseudo register.

   On some machines, the type of branch instruction generated may
depend on the way the condition code was produced; for example, on the
68k and SPARC, setting the condition code directly from an add or
subtract instruction does not clear the overflow bit the way that a test
instruction does, so a different branch instruction must be used for
some conditional branches.  For machines that use `(cc0)', the set and
use of the condition code must be adjacent (separated only by `note'
insns) allowing flags in `cc_status' to be used.  (*Note Condition
Code::.)  Also, the comparison and branch insns can be located from
each other by using the functions `prev_cc0_setter' and `next_cc0_user'.

   However, this is not true on machines that do not use `(cc0)'.  On
those machines, no assumptions can be made about the adjacency of the
compare and branch insns and the above methods cannot be used.  Instead,
we use the machine mode of the condition code register to record
different formats of the condition code register.

   Registers used to store the condition code value should have a mode
that is in class `MODE_CC'.  Normally, it will be `CCmode'.  If
additional modes are required (as for the add example mentioned above in
the SPARC), define the macro `EXTRA_CC_MODES' to list the additional
modes required (*note Condition Code::).  Also define `SELECT_CC_MODE'
to choose a mode given an operand of a compare.

   If it is known during RTL generation that a different mode will be
required (for example, if the machine has separate compare instructions
for signed and unsigned quantities, like most IBM processors), they can
be specified at that time.

   If the cases that require different modes would be made by
instruction combination, the macro `SELECT_CC_MODE' determines which
machine mode should be used for the comparison result.  The patterns
should be written using that mode.  To support the case of the add on
the SPARC discussed above, we have the pattern

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (reg:CC_NOOV 0)
             (compare:CC_NOOV
               (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "%r")
                        (match_operand:SI 1 "arith_operand" "rI"))
               (const_int 0)))]
       ""
       "...")

   The `SELECT_CC_MODE' macro on the SPARC returns `CC_NOOVmode' for
comparisons whose argument is a `plus'.

10.12 Defining Looping Instruction Patterns
===========================================

Some machines have special jump instructions that can be utilized to
make loops more efficient.  A common example is the 68000 `dbra'
instruction which performs a decrement of a register and a branch if the
result was greater than zero.  Other machines, in particular digital
signal processors (DSPs), have special block repeat instructions to
provide low-overhead loop support.  For example, the TI TMS320C3x/C4x
DSPs have a block repeat instruction that loads special registers to
mark the top and end of a loop and to count the number of loop
iterations.  This avoids the need for fetching and executing a
`dbra'-like instruction and avoids pipeline stalls associated with the
jump.

   GCC has three special named patterns to support low overhead looping.
They are `decrement_and_branch_until_zero', `doloop_begin', and
`doloop_end'.  The first pattern, `decrement_and_branch_until_zero', is
not emitted during RTL generation but may be emitted during the
instruction combination phase.  This requires the assistance of the
loop optimizer, using information collected during strength reduction,
to reverse a loop to count down to zero.  Some targets also require the
loop optimizer to add a `REG_NONNEG' note to indicate that the
iteration count is always positive.  This is needed if the target
performs a signed loop termination test.  For example, the 68000 uses a
pattern similar to the following for its `dbra' instruction:

     (define_insn "decrement_and_branch_until_zero"
       [(set (pc)
     	(if_then_else
     	  (ge (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "+d*am")
     		       (const_int -1))
     	      (const_int 0))
     	  (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))
     	  (pc)))
        (set (match_dup 0)
     	(plus:SI (match_dup 0)
     		 (const_int -1)))]
       "find_reg_note (insn, REG_NONNEG, 0)"
       "...")

   Note that since the insn is both a jump insn and has an output, it
must deal with its own reloads, hence the `m' constraints.  Also note
that since this insn is generated by the instruction combination phase
combining two sequential insns together into an implicit parallel insn,
the iteration counter needs to be biased by the same amount as the
decrement operation, in this case -1.  Note that the following similar
pattern will not be matched by the combiner.

     (define_insn "decrement_and_branch_until_zero"
       [(set (pc)
     	(if_then_else
     	  (ge (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "+d*am")
     	      (const_int 1))
     	  (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))
     	  (pc)))
        (set (match_dup 0)
     	(plus:SI (match_dup 0)
     		 (const_int -1)))]
       "find_reg_note (insn, REG_NONNEG, 0)"
       "...")

   The other two special looping patterns, `doloop_begin' and
`doloop_end', are emitted by the loop optimizer for certain
well-behaved loops with a finite number of loop iterations using
information collected during strength reduction.

   The `doloop_end' pattern describes the actual looping instruction
(or the implicit looping operation) and the `doloop_begin' pattern is
an optional companion pattern that can be used for initialization
needed for some low-overhead looping instructions.

   Note that some machines require the actual looping instruction to be
emitted at the top of the loop (e.g., the TMS320C3x/C4x DSPs).  Emitting
the true RTL for a looping instruction at the top of the loop can cause
problems with flow analysis.  So instead, a dummy `doloop' insn is
emitted at the end of the loop.  The machine dependent reorg pass checks
for the presence of this `doloop' insn and then searches back to the
top of the loop, where it inserts the true looping insn (provided there
are no instructions in the loop which would cause problems).  Any
additional labels can be emitted at this point.  In addition, if the
desired special iteration counter register was not allocated, this
machine dependent reorg pass could emit a traditional compare and jump
instruction pair.

   The essential difference between the
`decrement_and_branch_until_zero' and the `doloop_end' patterns is that
the loop optimizer allocates an additional pseudo register for the
latter as an iteration counter.  This pseudo register cannot be used
within the loop (i.e., general induction variables cannot be derived
from it), however, in many cases the loop induction variable may become
redundant and removed by the flow pass.

10.13 Canonicalization of Instructions
======================================

There are often cases where multiple RTL expressions could represent an
operation performed by a single machine instruction.  This situation is
most commonly encountered with logical, branch, and multiply-accumulate
instructions.  In such cases, the compiler attempts to convert these
multiple RTL expressions into a single canonical form to reduce the
number of insn patterns required.

   In addition to algebraic simplifications, following canonicalizations
are performed:

   * For commutative and comparison operators, a constant is always
     made the second operand.  If a machine only supports a constant as
     the second operand, only patterns that match a constant in the
     second operand need be supplied.

     For these operators, if only one operand is a `neg', `not',
     `mult', `plus', or `minus' expression, it will be the first
     operand.

   * In combinations of `neg', `mult', `plus', and `minus', the `neg'
     operations (if any) will be moved inside the operations as far as
     possible.  For instance, `(neg (mult A B))' is canonicalized as
     `(mult (neg A) B)', but `(plus (mult (neg A) B) C)' is
     canonicalized as `(minus A (mult B C))'.

   * For the `compare' operator, a constant is always the second operand
     on machines where `cc0' is used (*note Jump Patterns::).  On other
     machines, there are rare cases where the compiler might want to
     construct a `compare' with a constant as the first operand.
     However, these cases are not common enough for it to be worthwhile
     to provide a pattern matching a constant as the first operand
     unless the machine actually has such an instruction.

     An operand of `neg', `not', `mult', `plus', or `minus' is made the
     first operand under the same conditions as above.

   * `(minus X (const_int N))' is converted to `(plus X (const_int
     -N))'.

   * Within address computations (i.e., inside `mem'), a left shift is
     converted into the appropriate multiplication by a power of two.

   * De`Morgan's Law is used to move bitwise negation inside a bitwise
     logical-and or logical-or operation.  If this results in only one
     operand being a `not' expression, it will be the first one.

     A machine that has an instruction that performs a bitwise
     logical-and of one operand with the bitwise negation of the other
     should specify the pattern for that instruction as

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                  (and:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
                               (match_operand:M 2 ...)))]
            "..."
            "...")

     Similarly, a pattern for a "NAND" instruction should be written

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                  (ior:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
                               (not:M (match_operand:M 2 ...))))]
            "..."
            "...")

     In both cases, it is not necessary to include patterns for the many
     logically equivalent RTL expressions.

   * The only possible RTL expressions involving both bitwise
     exclusive-or and bitwise negation are `(xor:M X Y)' and `(not:M
     (xor:M X Y))'.

   * The sum of three items, one of which is a constant, will only
     appear in the form

          (plus:M (plus:M X Y) CONSTANT)

   * On machines that do not use `cc0', `(compare X (const_int 0))'
     will be converted to X.

   * Equality comparisons of a group of bits (usually a single bit)
     with zero will be written using `zero_extract' rather than the
     equivalent `and' or `sign_extract' operations.

10.14 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation
================================================

On some target machines, some standard pattern names for RTL generation
cannot be handled with single insn, but a sequence of RTL insns can
represent them.  For these target machines, you can write a
`define_expand' to specify how to generate the sequence of RTL.

   A `define_expand' is an RTL expression that looks almost like a
`define_insn'; but, unlike the latter, a `define_expand' is used only
for RTL generation and it can produce more than one RTL insn.

   A `define_expand' RTX has four operands:

   * The name.  Each `define_expand' must have a name, since the only
     use for it is to refer to it by name.

   * The RTL template.  This is a vector of RTL expressions representing
     a sequence of separate instructions.  Unlike `define_insn', there
     is no implicit surrounding `PARALLEL'.

   * The condition, a string containing a C expression.  This
     expression is used to express how the availability of this pattern
     depends on subclasses of target machine, selected by command-line
     options when GCC is run.  This is just like the condition of a
     `define_insn' that has a standard name.  Therefore, the condition
     (if present) may not depend on the data in the insn being matched,
     but only the target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to
     test these conditions during initialization in order to learn
     exactly which named instructions are available in a particular run.

   * The preparation statements, a string containing zero or more C
     statements which are to be executed before RTL code is generated
     from the RTL template.

     Usually these statements prepare temporary registers for use as
     internal operands in the RTL template, but they can also generate
     RTL insns directly by calling routines such as `emit_insn', etc.
     Any such insns precede the ones that come from the RTL template.

   Every RTL insn emitted by a `define_expand' must match some
`define_insn' in the machine description.  Otherwise, the compiler will
crash when trying to generate code for the insn or trying to optimize
it.

   The RTL template, in addition to controlling generation of RTL insns,
also describes the operands that need to be specified when this pattern
is used.  In particular, it gives a predicate for each operand.

   A true operand, which needs to be specified in order to generate RTL
from the pattern, should be described with a `match_operand' in its
first occurrence in the RTL template.  This enters information on the
operand's predicate into the tables that record such things.  GCC uses
the information to preload the operand into a register if that is
required for valid RTL code.  If the operand is referred to more than
once, subsequent references should use `match_dup'.

   The RTL template may also refer to internal "operands" which are
temporary registers or labels used only within the sequence made by the
`define_expand'.  Internal operands are substituted into the RTL
template with `match_dup', never with `match_operand'.  The values of
the internal operands are not passed in as arguments by the compiler
when it requests use of this pattern.  Instead, they are computed
within the pattern, in the preparation statements.  These statements
compute the values and store them into the appropriate elements of
`operands' so that `match_dup' can find them.

   There are two special macros defined for use in the preparation
statements: `DONE' and `FAIL'.  Use them with a following semicolon, as
a statement.

`DONE'
     Use the `DONE' macro to end RTL generation for the pattern.  The
     only RTL insns resulting from the pattern on this occasion will be
     those already emitted by explicit calls to `emit_insn' within the
     preparation statements; the RTL template will not be generated.

`FAIL'
     Make the pattern fail on this occasion.  When a pattern fails, it
     means that the pattern was not truly available.  The calling
     routines in the compiler will try other strategies for code
     generation using other patterns.

     Failure is currently supported only for binary (addition,
     multiplication, shifting, etc.) and bit-field (`extv', `extzv',
     and `insv') operations.

   If the preparation falls through (invokes neither `DONE' nor
`FAIL'), then the `define_expand' acts like a `define_insn' in that the
RTL template is used to generate the insn.

   The RTL template is not used for matching, only for generating the
initial insn list.  If the preparation statement always invokes `DONE'
or `FAIL', the RTL template may be reduced to a simple list of
operands, such as this example:

     (define_expand "addsi3"
       [(match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
        (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
        (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "")]
       ""
       "
     {
       handle_add (operands[0], operands[1], operands[2]);
       DONE;
     }")

   Here is an example, the definition of left-shift for the SPUR chip:

     (define_expand "ashlsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (ashift:SI
               (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
               (match_operand:SI 2 "nonmemory_operand" "")))]
       ""
       "

     {
       if (GET_CODE (operands[2]) != CONST_INT
           || (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) > 3)
         FAIL;
     }")

This example uses `define_expand' so that it can generate an RTL insn
for shifting when the shift-count is in the supported range of 0 to 3
but fail in other cases where machine insns aren't available.  When it
fails, the compiler tries another strategy using different patterns
(such as, a library call).

   If the compiler were able to handle nontrivial condition-strings in
patterns with names, then it would be possible to use a `define_insn'
in that case.  Here is another case (zero-extension on the 68000) which
makes more use of the power of `define_expand':

     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "")
             (const_int 0))
        (set (strict_low_part
               (subreg:HI
                 (match_dup 0)
                 0))
             (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" ""))]
       ""
       "operands[1] = make_safe_from (operands[1], operands[0]);")

Here two RTL insns are generated, one to clear the entire output operand
and the other to copy the input operand into its low half.  This
sequence is incorrect if the input operand refers to [the old value of]
the output operand, so the preparation statement makes sure this isn't
so.  The function `make_safe_from' copies the `operands[1]' into a
temporary register if it refers to `operands[0]'.  It does this by
emitting another RTL insn.

   Finally, a third example shows the use of an internal operand.
Zero-extension on the SPUR chip is done by `and'-ing the result against
a halfword mask.  But this mask cannot be represented by a `const_int'
because the constant value is too large to be legitimate on this
machine.  So it must be copied into a register with `force_reg' and
then the register used in the `and'.

     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (and:SI (subreg:SI
                       (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "")
                       0)
                     (match_dup 2)))]
       ""
       "operands[2]
          = force_reg (SImode, GEN_INT (65535)); ")

   *Note_* If the `define_expand' is used to serve a standard binary or
unary arithmetic operation or a bit-field operation, then the last insn
it generates must not be a `code_label', `barrier' or `note'.  It must
be an `insn', `jump_insn' or `call_insn'.  If you don't need a real insn
at the end, emit an insn to copy the result of the operation into
itself.  Such an insn will generate no code, but it can avoid problems
in the compiler.

10.15 Defining How to Split Instructions
========================================

There are two cases where you should specify how to split a pattern
into multiple insns.  On machines that have instructions requiring
delay slots (*note Delay Slots::) or that have instructions whose
output is not available for multiple cycles (*note Processor pipeline
description::), the compiler phases that optimize these cases need to
be able to move insns into one-instruction delay slots.  However, some
insns may generate more than one machine instruction.  These insns
cannot be placed into a delay slot.

   Often you can rewrite the single insn as a list of individual insns,
each corresponding to one machine instruction.  The disadvantage of
doing so is that it will cause the compilation to be slower and require
more space.  If the resulting insns are too complex, it may also
suppress some optimizations.  The compiler splits the insn if there is a
reason to believe that it might improve instruction or delay slot
scheduling.

   The insn combiner phase also splits putative insns.  If three insns
are merged into one insn with a complex expression that cannot be
matched by some `define_insn' pattern, the combiner phase attempts to
split the complex pattern into two insns that are recognized.  Usually
it can break the complex pattern into two patterns by splitting out some
subexpression.  However, in some other cases, such as performing an
addition of a large constant in two insns on a RISC machine, the way to
split the addition into two insns is machine-dependent.

   The `define_split' definition tells the compiler how to split a
complex insn into several simpler insns.  It looks like this:

     (define_split
       [INSN-PATTERN]
       "CONDITION"
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "PREPARATION-STATEMENTS")

   INSN-PATTERN is a pattern that needs to be split and CONDITION is
the final condition to be tested, as in a `define_insn'.  When an insn
matching INSN-PATTERN and satisfying CONDITION is found, it is replaced
in the insn list with the insns given by NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1,
NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2, etc.

   The PREPARATION-STATEMENTS are similar to those statements that are
specified for `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) and are
executed before the new RTL is generated to prepare for the generated
code or emit some insns whose pattern is not fixed.  Unlike those in
`define_expand', however, these statements must not generate any new
pseudo-registers.  Once reload has completed, they also must not
allocate any space in the stack frame.

   Patterns are matched against INSN-PATTERN in two different
circumstances.  If an insn needs to be split for delay slot scheduling
or insn scheduling, the insn is already known to be valid, which means
that it must have been matched by some `define_insn' and, if
`reload_completed' is nonzero, is known to satisfy the constraints of
that `define_insn'.  In that case, the new insn patterns must also be
insns that are matched by some `define_insn' and, if `reload_completed'
is nonzero, must also satisfy the constraints of those definitions.

   As an example of this usage of `define_split', consider the following
example from `a29k.md', which splits a `sign_extend' from `HImode' to
`SImode' into a pair of shift insns:

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
             (sign_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0)
             (ashift:SI (match_dup 1)
                        (const_int 16)))
        (set (match_dup 0)
             (ashiftrt:SI (match_dup 0)
                          (const_int 16)))]
       "
     { operands[1] = gen_lowpart (SImode, operands[1]); }")

   When the combiner phase tries to split an insn pattern, it is always
the case that the pattern is _not_ matched by any `define_insn'.  The
combiner pass first tries to split a single `set' expression and then
the same `set' expression inside a `parallel', but followed by a
`clobber' of a pseudo-reg to use as a scratch register.  In these
cases, the combiner expects exactly two new insn patterns to be
generated.  It will verify that these patterns match some `define_insn'
definitions, so you need not do this test in the `define_split' (of
course, there is no point in writing a `define_split' that will never
produce insns that match).

   Here is an example of this use of `define_split', taken from
`rs6000.md':

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "non_add_cint_operand" "")))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 3)))
        (set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4)))]
     "
     {
       int low = INTVAL (operands[2]) & 0xffff;
       int high = (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) >> 16;

       if (low & 0x8000)
         high++, low |= 0xffff0000;

       operands[3] = GEN_INT (high << 16);
       operands[4] = GEN_INT (low);
     }")

   Here the predicate `non_add_cint_operand' matches any `const_int'
that is _not_ a valid operand of a single add insn.  The add with the
smaller displacement is written so that it can be substituted into the
address of a subsequent operation.

   An example that uses a scratch register, from the same file,
generates an equality comparison of a register and a large constant:

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:CC 0 "cc_reg_operand" "")
             (compare:CC (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                         (match_operand:SI 2 "non_short_cint_operand" "")))
        (clobber (match_operand:SI 3 "gen_reg_operand" ""))]
       "find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)
        && (GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == EQ
            || GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == NE)"
       [(set (match_dup 3) (xor:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 4)))
        (set (match_dup 0) (compare:CC (match_dup 3) (match_dup 5)))]
       "
     {
       /* Get the constant we are comparing against, C, and see what it
          looks like sign-extended to 16 bits.  Then see what constant
          could be XOR'ed with C to get the sign-extended value.  */

       int c = INTVAL (operands[2]);
       int sextc = (c << 16) >> 16;
       int xorv = c ^ sextc;

       operands[4] = GEN_INT (xorv);
       operands[5] = GEN_INT (sextc);
     }")

   To avoid confusion, don't write a single `define_split' that accepts
some insns that match some `define_insn' as well as some insns that
don't.  Instead, write two separate `define_split' definitions, one for
the insns that are valid and one for the insns that are not valid.

   The splitter is allowed to split jump instructions into sequence of
jumps or create new jumps in while splitting non-jump instructions.  As
the central flowgraph and branch prediction information needs to be
updated, several restriction apply.

   Splitting of jump instruction into sequence that over by another jump
instruction is always valid, as compiler expect identical behavior of
new jump.  When new sequence contains multiple jump instructions or new
labels, more assistance is needed.  Splitter is required to create only
unconditional jumps, or simple conditional jump instructions.
Additionally it must attach a `REG_BR_PROB' note to each conditional
jump.  A global variable `split_branch_probability' hold the
probability of original branch in case it was an simple conditional
jump, -1 otherwise.  To simplify recomputing of edge frequencies, new
sequence is required to have only forward jumps to the newly created
labels.

   For the common case where the pattern of a define_split exactly
matches the pattern of a define_insn, use `define_insn_and_split'.  It
looks like this:

     (define_insn_and_split
       [INSN-PATTERN]
       "CONDITION"
       "OUTPUT-TEMPLATE"
       "SPLIT-CONDITION"
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "PREPARATION-STATEMENTS"
       [INSN-ATTRIBUTES])

   INSN-PATTERN, CONDITION, OUTPUT-TEMPLATE, and INSN-ATTRIBUTES are
used as in `define_insn'.  The NEW-INSN-PATTERN vector and the
PREPARATION-STATEMENTS are used as in a `define_split'.  The
SPLIT-CONDITION is also used as in `define_split', with the additional
behavior that if the condition starts with `&&', the condition used for
the split will be the constructed as a logical "and" of the split
condition with the insn condition.  For example, from i386.md:

     (define_insn_and_split "zero_extendhisi2_and"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=r")
          (zero_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "0")))
        (clobber (reg:CC 17))]
       "TARGET_ZERO_EXTEND_WITH_AND && !optimize_size"
       "#"
       "&& reload_completed"
       [(parallel [(set (match_dup 0)
                        (and:SI (match_dup 0) (const_int 65535)))
     	      (clobber (reg:CC 17))])]
       ""
       [(set_attr "type" "alu1")])

   In this case, the actual split condition will be
`TARGET_ZERO_EXTEND_WITH_AND && !optimize_size && reload_completed'.

   The `define_insn_and_split' construction provides exactly the same
functionality as two separate `define_insn' and `define_split'
patterns.  It exists for compactness, and as a maintenance tool to
prevent having to ensure the two patterns' templates match.

10.16 Including Patterns in Machine Descriptions.
=================================================

The `include' pattern tells the compiler tools where to look for
patterns that are in files other than in the file `.md'. This is used
only at build time and there is no preprocessing allowed.

   It looks like:


     (include
       PATHNAME)

   For example:


     (include "filestuff")

   Where PATHNAME is a string that specifies the location of the file,
specifies the include file to be in `gcc/config/target/filestuff'. The
directory `gcc/config/target' is regarded as the default directory.

   Machine descriptions may be split up into smaller more manageable
subsections and placed into subdirectories.

   By specifying:


     (include "BOGUS/filestuff")

   the include file is specified to be in
`gcc/config/TARGET/BOGUS/filestuff'.

   Specifying an absolute path for the include file such as;

     (include "/u2/BOGUS/filestuff")
   is permitted but is not encouraged.

10.16.1 RTL Generation Tool Options for Directory Search
--------------------------------------------------------

The `-IDIR' option specifies directories to search for machine
descriptions.  For example:


     genrecog -I/p1/abc/proc1 -I/p2/abcd/pro2 target.md

   Add the directory DIR to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system
machine definition file, substituting your own version, since these
directories are searched before the default machine description file
directories.  If you use more than one `-I' option, the directories are
scanned in left-to-right order; the standard default directory come
after.

10.17 Machine-Specific Peephole Optimizers
==========================================

In addition to instruction patterns the `md' file may contain
definitions of machine-specific peephole optimizations.

   The combiner does not notice certain peephole optimizations when the
data flow in the program does not suggest that it should try them.  For
example, sometimes two consecutive insns related in purpose can be
combined even though the second one does not appear to use a register
computed in the first one.  A machine-specific peephole optimizer can
detect such opportunities.

   There are two forms of peephole definitions that may be used.  The
original `define_peephole' is run at assembly output time to match
insns and substitute assembly text.  Use of `define_peephole' is
deprecated.

   A newer `define_peephole2' matches insns and substitutes new insns.
The `peephole2' pass is run after register allocation but before
scheduling, which may result in much better code for targets that do
scheduling.

File: gccint.info,  Node: define_peephole,  Next: define_peephole2,  Up: Peephole Definitions

10.17.1 RTL to Text Peephole Optimizers
---------------------------------------

A definition looks like this:

     (define_peephole
       [INSN-PATTERN-1
        INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "CONDITION"
       "TEMPLATE"
       "OPTIONAL-INSN-ATTRIBUTES")

The last string operand may be omitted if you are not using any
machine-specific information in this machine description.  If present,
it must obey the same rules as in a `define_insn'.

   In this skeleton, INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on are patterns to match
consecutive insns.  The optimization applies to a sequence of insns when
INSN-PATTERN-1 matches the first one, INSN-PATTERN-2 matches the next,
and so on.

   Each of the insns matched by a peephole must also match a
`define_insn'.  Peepholes are checked only at the last stage just
before code generation, and only optionally.  Therefore, any insn which
would match a peephole but no `define_insn' will cause a crash in code
generation in an unoptimized compilation, or at various optimization
stages.

   The operands of the insns are matched with `match_operands',
`match_operator', and `match_dup', as usual.  What is not usual is that
the operand numbers apply to all the insn patterns in the definition.
So, you can check for identical operands in two insns by using
`match_operand' in one insn and `match_dup' in the other.

   The operand constraints used in `match_operand' patterns do not have
any direct effect on the applicability of the peephole, but they will
be validated afterward, so make sure your constraints are general enough
to apply whenever the peephole matches.  If the peephole matches but
the constraints are not satisfied, the compiler will crash.

   It is safe to omit constraints in all the operands of the peephole;
or you can write constraints which serve as a double-check on the
criteria previously tested.

   Once a sequence of insns matches the patterns, the CONDITION is
checked.  This is a C expression which makes the final decision whether
to perform the optimization (we do so if the expression is nonzero).  If
CONDITION is omitted (in other words, the string is empty) then the
optimization is applied to every sequence of insns that matches the
patterns.

   The defined peephole optimizations are applied after register
allocation is complete.  Therefore, the peephole definition can check
which operands have ended up in which kinds of registers, just by
looking at the operands.

   The way to refer to the operands in CONDITION is to write
`operands[I]' for operand number I (as matched by `(match_operand I
...)').  Use the variable `insn' to refer to the last of the insns
being matched; use `prev_active_insn' to find the preceding insns.

   When optimizing computations with intermediate results, you can use
CONDITION to match only when the intermediate results are not used
elsewhere.  Use the C expression `dead_or_set_p (INSN, OP)', where INSN
is the insn in which you expect the value to be used for the last time
(from the value of `insn', together with use of `prev_nonnote_insn'),
and OP is the intermediate value (from `operands[I]').

   Applying the optimization means replacing the sequence of insns with
one new insn.  The TEMPLATE controls ultimate output of assembler code
for this combined insn.  It works exactly like the template of a
`define_insn'.  Operand numbers in this template are the same ones used
in matching the original sequence of insns.

   The result of a defined peephole optimizer does not need to match
any of the insn patterns in the machine description; it does not even
have an opportunity to match them.  The peephole optimizer definition
itself serves as the insn pattern to control how the insn is output.

   Defined peephole optimizers are run as assembler code is being
output, so the insns they produce are never combined or rearranged in
any way.

   Here is an example, taken from the 68000 machine description:

     (define_peephole
       [(set (reg:SI 15) (plus:SI (reg:SI 15) (const_int 4)))
        (set (match_operand:DF 0 "register_operand" "=f")
             (match_operand:DF 1 "register_operand" "ad"))]
       "FP_REG_P (operands[0]) && ! FP_REG_P (operands[1])"
     {
       rtx xoperands[2];
       xoperands[1] = gen_rtx (REG, SImode, REGNO (operands[1]) + 1);
     #ifdef MOTOROLA
       output_asm_insn ("move.l %1,(sp)", xoperands);
       output_asm_insn ("move.l %1,-(sp)", operands);
       return "fmove.d (sp)+,%0";
     #else
       output_asm_insn ("movel %1,sp@", xoperands);
       output_asm_insn ("movel %1,sp@-", operands);
       return "fmoved sp@+,%0";
     #endif
     })

   The effect of this optimization is to change

     jbsr _foobar
     addql #4,sp
     movel d1,sp@-
     movel d0,sp@-
     fmoved sp@+,fp0

into

     jbsr _foobar
     movel d1,sp@
     movel d0,sp@-
     fmoved sp@+,fp0

   INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on look _almost_ like the second operand of
`define_insn'.  There is one important difference: the second operand
of `define_insn' consists of one or more RTX's enclosed in square
brackets.  Usually, there is only one: then the same action can be
written as an element of a `define_peephole'.  But when there are
multiple actions in a `define_insn', they are implicitly enclosed in a
`parallel'.  Then you must explicitly write the `parallel', and the
square brackets within it, in the `define_peephole'.  Thus, if an insn
pattern looks like this,

     (define_insn "divmodsi4"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
             (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
        (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
             (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))]
       "TARGET_68020"
       "divsl%.l %2,%3:%0")

then the way to mention this insn in a peephole is as follows:

     (define_peephole
       [...
        (parallel
         [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
               (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                       (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
          (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
               (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))])
        ...]
       ...)

10.17.2 RTL to RTL Peephole Optimizers
--------------------------------------

The `define_peephole2' definition tells the compiler how to substitute
one sequence of instructions for another sequence, what additional
scratch registers may be needed and what their lifetimes must be.

     (define_peephole2
       [INSN-PATTERN-1
        INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "CONDITION"
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "PREPARATION-STATEMENTS")

   The definition is almost identical to `define_split' (*note Insn
Splitting::) except that the pattern to match is not a single
instruction, but a sequence of instructions.

   It is possible to request additional scratch registers for use in the
output template.  If appropriate registers are not free, the pattern
will simply not match.

   Scratch registers are requested with a `match_scratch' pattern at
the top level of the input pattern.  The allocated register (initially)
will be dead at the point requested within the original sequence.  If
the scratch is used at more than a single point, a `match_dup' pattern
at the top level of the input pattern marks the last position in the
input sequence at which the register must be available.

   Here is an example from the IA-32 machine description:

     (define_peephole2
       [(match_scratch:SI 2 "r")
        (parallel [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
                        (match_operator:SI 3 "arith_or_logical_operator"
                          [(match_dup 0)
                           (match_operand:SI 1 "memory_operand" "")]))
                   (clobber (reg:CC 17))])]
       "! optimize_size && ! TARGET_READ_MODIFY"
       [(set (match_dup 2) (match_dup 1))
        (parallel [(set (match_dup 0)
                        (match_op_dup 3 [(match_dup 0) (match_dup 2)]))
                   (clobber (reg:CC 17))])]
       "")

This pattern tries to split a load from its use in the hopes that we'll
be able to schedule around the memory load latency.  It allocates a
single `SImode' register of class `GENERAL_REGS' (`"r"') that needs to
be live only at the point just before the arithmetic.

   A real example requiring extended scratch lifetimes is harder to
come by, so here's a silly made-up example:

     (define_peephole2
       [(match_scratch:SI 4 "r")
        (set (match_operand:SI 0 "" "") (match_operand:SI 1 "" ""))
        (set (match_operand:SI 2 "" "") (match_dup 1))
        (match_dup 4)
        (set (match_operand:SI 3 "" "") (match_dup 1))]
       "/* determine 1 does not overlap 0 and 2 */"
       [(set (match_dup 4) (match_dup 1))
        (set (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4))
        (set (match_dup 2) (match_dup 4))]
        (set (match_dup 3) (match_dup 4))]
       "")

If we had not added the `(match_dup 4)' in the middle of the input
sequence, it might have been the case that the register we chose at the
beginning of the sequence is killed by the first or second `set'.

10.18 Instruction Attributes
============================

In addition to describing the instruction supported by the target
machine, the `md' file also defines a group of "attributes" and a set of
values for each.  Every generated insn is assigned a value for each
attribute.  One possible attribute would be the effect that the insn
has on the machine's condition code.  This attribute can then be used
by `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to track the condition codes.

* Menu:

* Defining Attributes:: Specifying attributes and their values.
* Expressions::         Valid expressions for attribute values.
* Tagging Insns::       Assigning attribute values to insns.
* Attr Example::        An example of assigning attributes.
* Insn Lengths::        Computing the length of insns.
* Constant Attributes:: Defining attributes that are constant.
* Delay Slots::         Defining delay slots required for a machine.
* Processor pipeline description:: Specifying information for insn scheduling.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Defining Attributes,  Next: Expressions,  Up: Insn Attributes

10.18.1 Defining Attributes and their Values
--------------------------------------------

The `define_attr' expression is used to define each attribute required
by the target machine.  It looks like:

     (define_attr NAME LIST-OF-VALUES DEFAULT)

   NAME is a string specifying the name of the attribute being defined.

   LIST-OF-VALUES is either a string that specifies a comma-separated
list of values that can be assigned to the attribute, or a null string
to indicate that the attribute takes numeric values.

   DEFAULT is an attribute expression that gives the value of this
attribute for insns that match patterns whose definition does not
include an explicit value for this attribute.  *Note Attr Example::,
for more information on the handling of defaults.  *Note Constant
Attributes::, for information on attributes that do not depend on any
particular insn.

   For each defined attribute, a number of definitions are written to
the `insn-attr.h' file.  For cases where an explicit set of values is
specified for an attribute, the following are defined:

   * A `#define' is written for the symbol `HAVE_ATTR_NAME'.

   * An enumerated class is defined for `attr_NAME' with elements of
     the form `UPPER-NAME_UPPER-VALUE' where the attribute name and
     value are first converted to uppercase.

   * A function `get_attr_NAME' is defined that is passed an insn and
     returns the attribute value for that insn.

   For example, if the following is present in the `md' file:

     (define_attr "type" "branch,fp,load,store,arith" ...)

the following lines will be written to the file `insn-attr.h'.

     #define HAVE_ATTR_type
     enum attr_type {TYPE_BRANCH, TYPE_FP, TYPE_LOAD,
                      TYPE_STORE, TYPE_ARITH};
     extern enum attr_type get_attr_type ();

   If the attribute takes numeric values, no `enum' type will be
defined and the function to obtain the attribute's value will return

10.18.2 Attribute Expressions
-----------------------------

RTL expressions used to define attributes use the codes described above
plus a few specific to attribute definitions, to be discussed below.
Attribute value expressions must have one of the following forms:

`(const_int I)'
     The integer I specifies the value of a numeric attribute.  I must
     be non-negative.

     The value of a numeric attribute can be specified either with a
     `const_int', or as an integer represented as a string in
     `const_string', `eq_attr' (see below), `attr', `symbol_ref',
     simple arithmetic expressions, and `set_attr' overrides on
     specific instructions (*note Tagging Insns::).

`(const_string VALUE)'
     The string VALUE specifies a constant attribute value.  If VALUE
     is specified as `"*"', it means that the default value of the
     attribute is to be used for the insn containing this expression.
     `"*"' obviously cannot be used in the DEFAULT expression of a
     `define_attr'.

     If the attribute whose value is being specified is numeric, VALUE
     must be a string containing a non-negative integer (normally
     `const_int' would be used in this case).  Otherwise, it must
     contain one of the valid values for the attribute.

`(if_then_else TEST TRUE-VALUE FALSE-VALUE)'
     TEST specifies an attribute test, whose format is defined below.
     The value of this expression is TRUE-VALUE if TEST is true,
     otherwise it is FALSE-VALUE.

`(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 ...] DEFAULT)'
     The first operand of this expression is a vector containing an even
     number of expressions and consisting of pairs of TEST and VALUE
     expressions.  The value of the `cond' expression is that of the
     VALUE corresponding to the first true TEST expression.  If none of
     the TEST expressions are true, the value of the `cond' expression
     is that of the DEFAULT expression.

   TEST expressions can have one of the following forms:

`(const_int I)'
     This test is true if I is nonzero and false otherwise.

`(not TEST)'
`(ior TEST1 TEST2)'
`(and TEST1 TEST2)'
     These tests are true if the indicated logical function is true.

`(match_operand:M N PRED CONSTRAINTS)'
     This test is true if operand N of the insn whose attribute value
     is being determined has mode M (this part of the test is ignored
     if M is `VOIDmode') and the function specified by the string PRED
     returns a nonzero value when passed operand N and mode M (this
     part of the test is ignored if PRED is the null string).

     The CONSTRAINTS operand is ignored and should be the null string.

`(le ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(leu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(lt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ltu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(gt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(gtu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ge ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(geu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ne ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(eq ARITH1 ARITH2)'
     These tests are true if the indicated comparison of the two
     arithmetic expressions is true.  Arithmetic expressions are formed
     with `plus', `minus', `mult', `div', `mod', `abs', `neg', `and',
     `ior', `xor', `not', `ashift', `lshiftrt', and `ashiftrt'
     expressions.

     `const_int' and `symbol_ref' are always valid terms (*note Insn
     Lengths::,for additional forms).  `symbol_ref' is a string
     denoting a C expression that yields an `int' when evaluated by the
     `get_attr_...' routine.  It should normally be a global variable.

`(eq_attr NAME VALUE)'
     NAME is a string specifying the name of an attribute.

     VALUE is a string that is either a valid value for attribute NAME,
     a comma-separated list of values, or `!' followed by a value or
     list.  If VALUE does not begin with a `!', this test is true if
     the value of the NAME attribute of the current insn is in the list
     specified by VALUE.  If VALUE begins with a `!', this test is true
     if the attribute's value is _not_ in the specified list.

     For example,

          (eq_attr "type" "load,store")

     is equivalent to

          (ior (eq_attr "type" "load") (eq_attr "type" "store"))

     If NAME specifies an attribute of `alternative', it refers to the
     value of the compiler variable `which_alternative' (*note Output
     Statement::) and the values must be small integers.  For example,

          (eq_attr "alternative" "2,3")

     is equivalent to

          (ior (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 2))
               (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 3)))

     Note that, for most attributes, an `eq_attr' test is simplified in
     cases where the value of the attribute being tested is known for
     all insns matching a particular pattern.  This is by far the most
     common case.

`(attr_flag NAME)'
     The value of an `attr_flag' expression is true if the flag
     specified by NAME is true for the `insn' currently being scheduled.

     NAME is a string specifying one of a fixed set of flags to test.
     Test the flags `forward' and `backward' to determine the direction
     of a conditional branch.  Test the flags `very_likely', `likely',
     `very_unlikely', and `unlikely' to determine if a conditional
     branch is expected to be taken.

     If the `very_likely' flag is true, then the `likely' flag is also
     true.  Likewise for the `very_unlikely' and `unlikely' flags.

     This example describes a conditional branch delay slot which can
     be nullified for forward branches that are taken (annul-true) or
     for backward branches which are not taken (annul-false).

          (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "cbranch")
            [(eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
                  (attr_flag "forward"))
             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
                  (attr_flag "backward"))])

     The `forward' and `backward' flags are false if the current `insn'
     being scheduled is not a conditional branch.

     The `very_likely' and `likely' flags are true if the `insn' being
     scheduled is not a conditional branch.  The `very_unlikely' and
     `unlikely' flags are false if the `insn' being scheduled is not a
     conditional branch.

     `attr_flag' is only used during delay slot scheduling and has no
     meaning to other passes of the compiler.

`(attr NAME)'
     The value of another attribute is returned.  This is most useful
     for numeric attributes, as `eq_attr' and `attr_flag' produce more
     efficient code for non-numeric attributes.

10.18.3 Assigning Attribute Values to Insns
-------------------------------------------

The value assigned to an attribute of an insn is primarily determined by
which pattern is matched by that insn (or which `define_peephole'
generated it).  Every `define_insn' and `define_peephole' can have an
optional last argument to specify the values of attributes for matching
insns.  The value of any attribute not specified in a particular insn
is set to the default value for that attribute, as specified in its
`define_attr'.  Extensive use of default values for attributes permits
the specification of the values for only one or two attributes in the
definition of most insn patterns, as seen in the example in the next
section.

   The optional last argument of `define_insn' and `define_peephole' is
a vector of expressions, each of which defines the value for a single
attribute.  The most general way of assigning an attribute's value is
to use a `set' expression whose first operand is an `attr' expression
giving the name of the attribute being set.  The second operand of the
`set' is an attribute expression (*note Expressions::) giving the value
of the attribute.

   When the attribute value depends on the `alternative' attribute
(i.e., which is the applicable alternative in the constraint of the
insn), the `set_attr_alternative' expression can be used.  It allows
the specification of a vector of attribute expressions, one for each
alternative.

   When the generality of arbitrary attribute expressions is not
required, the simpler `set_attr' expression can be used, which allows
specifying a string giving either a single attribute value or a list of
attribute values, one for each alternative.

   The form of each of the above specifications is shown below.  In
each case, NAME is a string specifying the attribute to be set.

`(set_attr NAME VALUE-STRING)'
     VALUE-STRING is either a string giving the desired attribute value,
     or a string containing a comma-separated list giving the values for
     succeeding alternatives.  The number of elements must match the
     number of alternatives in the constraint of the insn pattern.

     Note that it may be useful to specify `*' for some alternative, in
     which case the attribute will assume its default value for insns
     matching that alternative.

`(set_attr_alternative NAME [VALUE1 VALUE2 ...])'
     Depending on the alternative of the insn, the value will be one of
     the specified values.  This is a shorthand for using a `cond' with
     tests on the `alternative' attribute.

`(set (attr NAME) VALUE)'
     The first operand of this `set' must be the special RTL expression
     `attr', whose sole operand is a string giving the name of the
     attribute being set.  VALUE is the value of the attribute.

   The following shows three different ways of representing the same
attribute value specification:

     (set_attr "type" "load,store,arith")

     (set_attr_alternative "type"
                           [(const_string "load") (const_string "store")
                            (const_string "arith")])

     (set (attr "type")
          (cond [(eq_attr "alternative" "1") (const_string "load")
                 (eq_attr "alternative" "2") (const_string "store")]
                (const_string "arith")))

   The `define_asm_attributes' expression provides a mechanism to
specify the attributes assigned to insns produced from an `asm'
statement.  It has the form:

     (define_asm_attributes [ATTR-SETS])

where ATTR-SETS is specified the same as for both the `define_insn' and
the `define_peephole' expressions.

   These values will typically be the "worst case" attribute values.
For example, they might indicate that the condition code will be
clobbered.

   A specification for a `length' attribute is handled specially.  The
way to compute the length of an `asm' insn is to multiply the length
specified in the expression `define_asm_attributes' by the number of
machine instructions specified in the `asm' statement, determined by
counting the number of semicolons and newlines in the string.
Therefore, the value of the `length' attribute specified in a
`define_asm_attributes' should be the maximum possible length of a
single machine instruction.

10.18.4 Example of Attribute Specifications
-------------------------------------------

The judicious use of defaulting is important in the efficient use of
insn attributes.  Typically, insns are divided into "types" and an
attribute, customarily called `type', is used to represent this value.
This attribute is normally used only to define the default value for
other attributes.  An example will clarify this usage.

   Assume we have a RISC machine with a condition code and in which only
full-word operations are performed in registers.  Let us assume that we
can divide all insns into loads, stores, (integer) arithmetic
operations, floating point operations, and branches.

   Here we will concern ourselves with determining the effect of an
insn on the condition code and will limit ourselves to the following
possible effects:  The condition code can be set unpredictably
(clobbered), not be changed, be set to agree with the results of the
operation, or only changed if the item previously set into the
condition code has been modified.

   Here is part of a sample `md' file for such a machine:

     (define_attr "type" "load,store,arith,fp,branch" (const_string "arith"))

     (define_attr "cc" "clobber,unchanged,set,change0"
                  (cond [(eq_attr "type" "load")
                             (const_string "change0")
                         (eq_attr "type" "store,branch")
                             (const_string "unchanged")
                         (eq_attr "type" "arith")
                             (if_then_else (match_operand:SI 0 "" "")
                                           (const_string "set")
                                           (const_string "clobber"))]
                        (const_string "clobber")))

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,r,m")
             (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r,m,r"))]
       ""
       "@
        move %0,%1
        load %0,%1
        store %0,%1"
       [(set_attr "type" "arith,load,store")])

   Note that we assume in the above example that arithmetic operations
performed on quantities smaller than a machine word clobber the
condition code since they will set the condition code to a value
corresponding to the full-word result.

10.18.5 Computing the Length of an Insn
---------------------------------------

For many machines, multiple types of branch instructions are provided,
each for different length branch displacements.  In most cases, the
assembler will choose the correct instruction to use.  However, when
the assembler cannot do so, GCC can when a special attribute, the
`length' attribute, is defined.  This attribute must be defined to have
numeric values by specifying a null string in its `define_attr'.

   In the case of the `length' attribute, two additional forms of
arithmetic terms are allowed in test expressions:

`(match_dup N)'
     This refers to the address of operand N of the current insn, which
     must be a `label_ref'.

`(pc)'
     This refers to the address of the _current_ insn.  It might have
     been more consistent with other usage to make this the address of
     the _next_ insn but this would be confusing because the length of
     the current insn is to be computed.

   For normal insns, the length will be determined by value of the
`length' attribute.  In the case of `addr_vec' and `addr_diff_vec' insn
patterns, the length is computed as the number of vectors multiplied by
the size of each vector.

   Lengths are measured in addressable storage units (bytes).

   The following macros can be used to refine the length computation:

`ADJUST_INSN_LENGTH (INSN, LENGTH)'
     If defined, modifies the length assigned to instruction INSN as a
     function of the context in which it is used.  LENGTH is an lvalue
     that contains the initially computed length of the insn and should
     be updated with the correct length of the insn.

     This macro will normally not be required.  A case in which it is
     required is the ROMP.  On this machine, the size of an `addr_vec'
     insn must be increased by two to compensate for the fact that
     alignment may be required.

   The routine that returns `get_attr_length' (the value of the
`length' attribute) can be used by the output routine to determine the
form of the branch instruction to be written, as the example below
illustrates.

   As an example of the specification of variable-length branches,
consider the IBM 360.  If we adopt the convention that a register will
be set to the starting address of a function, we can jump to labels
within 4k of the start using a four-byte instruction.  Otherwise, we
need a six-byte sequence to load the address from memory and then
branch to it.

   On such a machine, a pattern for a branch instruction might be
specified as follows:

     (define_insn "jump"
       [(set (pc)
             (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" "")))]
       ""
     {
        return (get_attr_length (insn) == 4
                ? "b %l0" : "l r15,=a(%l0); br r15");
     }
       [(set (attr "length")
             (if_then_else (lt (match_dup 0) (const_int 4096))
                           (const_int 4)
                           (const_int 6)))])


File: gccint.info,  Node: Constant Attributes,  Next: Delay Slots,  Prev: Insn Lengths,  Up: Insn Attributes

10.18.6 Constant Attributes
---------------------------

A special form of `define_attr', where the expression for the default
value is a `const' expression, indicates an attribute that is constant
for a given run of the compiler.  Constant attributes may be used to
specify which variety of processor is used.  For example,

     (define_attr "cpu" "m88100,m88110,m88000"
      (const
       (cond [(symbol_ref "TARGET_88100") (const_string "m88100")
              (symbol_ref "TARGET_88110") (const_string "m88110")]
             (const_string "m88000"))))

     (define_attr "memory" "fast,slow"
      (const
       (if_then_else (symbol_ref "TARGET_FAST_MEM")
                     (const_string "fast")
                     (const_string "slow"))))

   The routine generated for constant attributes has no parameters as it
does not depend on any particular insn.  RTL expressions used to define
the value of a constant attribute may use the `symbol_ref' form, but
may not use either the `match_operand' form or `eq_attr' forms
involving insn attributes.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Delay Slots,  Next: Processor pipeline description,  Prev: Constant Attributes,  Up: Insn Attributes

10.18.7 Delay Slot Scheduling
-----------------------------

The insn attribute mechanism can be used to specify the requirements for
delay slots, if any, on a target machine.  An instruction is said to
require a "delay slot" if some instructions that are physically after
the instruction are executed as if they were located before it.
Classic examples are branch and call instructions, which often execute
the following instruction before the branch or call is performed.

   On some machines, conditional branch instructions can optionally
"annul" instructions in the delay slot.  This means that the
instruction will not be executed for certain branch outcomes.  Both
instructions that annul if the branch is true and instructions that
annul if the branch is false are supported.

   Delay slot scheduling differs from instruction scheduling in that
determining whether an instruction needs a delay slot is dependent only
on the type of instruction being generated, not on data flow between the
instructions.  See the next section for a discussion of data-dependent
instruction scheduling.

   The requirement of an insn needing one or more delay slots is
indicated via the `define_delay' expression.  It has the following form:

     (define_delay TEST
                   [DELAY-1 ANNUL-TRUE-1 ANNUL-FALSE-1
                    DELAY-2 ANNUL-TRUE-2 ANNUL-FALSE-2
                    ...])

   TEST is an attribute test that indicates whether this `define_delay'
applies to a particular insn.  If so, the number of required delay
slots is determined by the length of the vector specified as the second
argument.  An insn placed in delay slot N must satisfy attribute test
DELAY-N.  ANNUL-TRUE-N is an attribute test that specifies which insns
may be annulled if the branch is true.  Similarly, ANNUL-FALSE-N
specifies which insns in the delay slot may be annulled if the branch
is false.  If annulling is not supported for that delay slot, `(nil)'
should be coded.

   For example, in the common case where branch and call insns require
a single delay slot, which may contain any insn other than a branch or
call, the following would be placed in the `md' file:

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch,call")
                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

   Multiple `define_delay' expressions may be specified.  In this case,
each such expression specifies different delay slot requirements and
there must be no insn for which tests in two `define_delay' expressions
are both true.

   For example, if we have a machine that requires one delay slot for
branches but two for calls,  no delay slot can contain a branch or call
insn, and any valid insn in the delay slot for the branch can be
annulled if the branch is true, we might represent this as follows:

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch")
        [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
         (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
         (nil)])

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "call")
                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)
                    (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

10.18.8 Specifying processor pipeline description
-------------------------------------------------

To achieve better performance, most modern processors (super-pipelined,
superscalar RISC, and VLIW processors) have many "functional units" on
which several instructions can be executed simultaneously.  An
instruction starts execution if its issue conditions are satisfied.  If
not, the instruction is stalled until its conditions are satisfied.
Such "interlock (pipeline) delay" causes interruption of the fetching
of successor instructions (or demands nop instructions, e.g. for some
MIPS processors).

   There are two major kinds of interlock delays in modern processors.
The first one is a data dependence delay determining "instruction
latency time".  The instruction execution is not started until all
source data have been evaluated by prior instructions (there are more
complex cases when the instruction execution starts even when the data
are not available but will be ready in given time after the instruction
execution start).  Taking the data dependence delays into account is
simple.  The data dependence (true, output, and anti-dependence) delay
between two instructions is given by a constant.  In most cases this
approach is adequate.  The second kind of interlock delays is a
reservation delay.  The reservation delay means that two instructions
under execution will be in need of shared processors resources, i.e.
buses, internal registers, and/or functional units, which are reserved
for some time.  Taking this kind of delay into account is complex
especially for modern RISC processors.

   The task of exploiting more processor parallelism is solved by an
instruction scheduler.  For a better solution to this problem, the
instruction scheduler has to have an adequate description of the
processor parallelism (or "pipeline description").  Currently GCC
provides two alternative ways to describe processor parallelism, both
described below.  The first method is outlined in the next section; it
was once the only method provided by GCC, and thus is used in a number
of exiting ports.  The second, and preferred method, specifies
functional unit reservations for groups of instructions with the aid of
"regular expressions".  This is called the "automaton based
description".

   The GCC instruction scheduler uses a "pipeline hazard recognizer" to
figure out the possibility of the instruction issue by the processor on
a given simulated processor cycle.  The pipeline hazard recognizer is
automatically generated from the processor pipeline description.  The
pipeline hazard recognizer generated from the automaton based
description is more sophisticated and based on a deterministic finite
state automaton (DFA) and therefore faster than one generated from the
old description.  Furthermore, its speed is not dependent on processor
complexity.  The instruction issue is possible if there is a transition
from one automaton state to another one.

   You can use either model to describe processor pipeline
characteristics or even mix them.  You could use the old description
for some processor submodels and the DFA-based one for other processor
submodels.

   In general, using the automaton based description is preferred.  Its
model is richer and makes it possible to more accurately describe
pipeline characteristics of processors, which results in improved code
quality (although sometimes only marginally).  It will also be used as
an infrastructure to implement sophisticated and practical instruction
scheduling which will try many instruction sequences to choose the best
one.

10.18.8.1 Specifying Function Units
...................................

On most RISC machines, there are instructions whose results are not
available for a specific number of cycles.  Common cases are
instructions that load data from memory.  On many machines, a pipeline
stall will result if the data is referenced too soon after the load
instruction.

   In addition, many newer microprocessors have multiple function
units, usually one for integer and one for floating point, and often
will incur pipeline stalls when a result that is needed is not yet
ready.

   The descriptions in this section allow the specification of how much
time must elapse between the execution of an instruction and the time
when its result is used.  It also allows specification of when the
execution of an instruction will delay execution of similar instructions
due to function unit conflicts.

   For the purposes of the specifications in this section, a machine is
divided into "function units", each of which execute a specific class
of instructions in first-in-first-out order.  Function units that
accept one instruction each cycle and allow a result to be used in the
succeeding instruction (usually via forwarding) need not be specified.
Classic RISC microprocessors will normally have a single function unit,
which we can call `memory'.  The newer "superscalar" processors will
often have function units for floating point operations, usually at
least a floating point adder and multiplier.

   Each usage of a function units by a class of insns is specified with
a `define_function_unit' expression, which looks like this:

     (define_function_unit NAME MULTIPLICITY SIMULTANEITY
                           TEST READY-DELAY ISSUE-DELAY
                          [CONFLICT-LIST])

   NAME is a string giving the name of the function unit.

   MULTIPLICITY is an integer specifying the number of identical units
in the processor.  If more than one unit is specified, they will be
scheduled independently.  Only truly independent units should be
counted; a pipelined unit should be specified as a single unit.  (The
only common example of a machine that has multiple function units for a
single instruction class that are truly independent and not pipelined
are the two multiply and two increment units of the CDC 6600.)

   SIMULTANEITY specifies the maximum number of insns that can be
executing in each instance of the function unit simultaneously or zero
if the unit is pipelined and has no limit.

   All `define_function_unit' definitions referring to function unit
NAME must have the same name and values for MULTIPLICITY and
SIMULTANEITY.

   TEST is an attribute test that selects the insns we are describing
in this definition.  Note that an insn may use more than one function
unit and a function unit may be specified in more than one
`define_function_unit'.

   READY-DELAY is an integer that specifies the number of cycles after
which the result of the instruction can be used without introducing any
stalls.

   ISSUE-DELAY is an integer that specifies the number of cycles after
the instruction matching the TEST expression begins using this unit
until a subsequent instruction can begin.  A cost of N indicates an N-1
cycle delay.  A subsequent instruction may also be delayed if an
earlier instruction has a longer READY-DELAY value.  This blocking
effect is computed using the SIMULTANEITY, READY-DELAY, ISSUE-DELAY,
and CONFLICT-LIST terms.  For a normal non-pipelined function unit,
SIMULTANEITY is one, the unit is taken to block for the READY-DELAY
cycles of the executing insn, and smaller values of ISSUE-DELAY are
ignored.

   CONFLICT-LIST is an optional list giving detailed conflict costs for
this unit.  If specified, it is a list of condition test expressions to
be applied to insns chosen to execute in NAME following the particular
insn matching TEST that is already executing in NAME.  For each insn in
the list, ISSUE-DELAY specifies the conflict cost; for insns not in the
list, the cost is zero.  If not specified, CONFLICT-LIST defaults to
all instructions that use the function unit.

   Typical uses of this vector are where a floating point function unit
can pipeline either single- or double-precision operations, but not
both, or where a memory unit can pipeline loads, but not stores, etc.

   As an example, consider a classic RISC machine where the result of a
load instruction is not available for two cycles (a single "delay"
instruction is required) and where only one load instruction can be
executed simultaneously.  This would be specified as:

     (define_function_unit "memory" 1 1 (eq_attr "type" "load") 2 0)

   For the case of a floating point function unit that can pipeline
either single or double precision, but not both, the following could be
specified:

     (define_function_unit
        "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "sp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "dp_fp")])
     (define_function_unit
        "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "dp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "sp_fp")])

   *Note_* The scheduler attempts to avoid function unit conflicts and
uses all the specifications in the `define_function_unit' expression.
It has recently been discovered that these specifications may not allow
modeling of some of the newer "superscalar" processors that have insns
using multiple pipelined units.  These insns will cause a potential
conflict for the second unit used during their execution and there is
no way of representing that conflict.  Any examples of how function
unit conflicts work in such processors and suggestions for their
representation would be welcomed.

10.18.8.2 Describing instruction pipeline characteristics
.........................................................

This section describes constructions of the automaton based processor
pipeline description.  The order of constructions within the machine
description file is not important.

   The following optional construction describes names of automata
generated and used for the pipeline hazards recognition.  Sometimes the
generated finite state automaton used by the pipeline hazard recognizer
is large.  If we use more than one automaton and bind functional units
to the automata, the total size of the automata is usually less than
the size of the single automaton.  If there is no one such
construction, only one finite state automaton is generated.

     (define_automaton AUTOMATA-NAMES)

   AUTOMATA-NAMES is a string giving names of the automata.  The names
are separated by commas.  All the automata should have unique names.
The automaton name is used in the constructions `define_cpu_unit' and
`define_query_cpu_unit'.

   Each processor functional unit used in the description of instruction
reservations should be described by the following construction.

     (define_cpu_unit UNIT-NAMES [AUTOMATON-NAME])

   UNIT-NAMES is a string giving the names of the functional units
separated by commas.  Don't use name `nothing', it is reserved for
other goals.

   AUTOMATON-NAME is a string giving the name of the automaton with
which the unit is bound.  The automaton should be described in
construction `define_automaton'.  You should give "automaton-name", if
there is a defined automaton.

   The assignment of units to automata are constrained by the uses of
the units in insn reservations.  The most important constraint is: if a
unit reservation is present on a particular cycle of an alternative for
an insn reservation, then some unit from the same automaton must be
present on the same cycle for the other alternatives of the insn
reservation.  The rest of the constraints are mentioned in the
description of the subsequent constructions.

   The following construction describes CPU functional units analogously
to `define_cpu_unit'.  The reservation of such units can be queried for
an automaton state.  The instruction scheduler never queries
reservation of functional units for given automaton state.  So as a
rule, you don't need this construction.  This construction could be
used for future code generation goals (e.g. to generate VLIW insn
templates).

     (define_query_cpu_unit UNIT-NAMES [AUTOMATON-NAME])

   UNIT-NAMES is a string giving names of the functional units
separated by commas.

   AUTOMATON-NAME is a string giving the name of the automaton with
which the unit is bound.

   The following construction is the major one to describe pipeline
characteristics of an instruction.

     (define_insn_reservation INSN-NAME DEFAULT_LATENCY
                              CONDITION REGEXP)

   DEFAULT_LATENCY is a number giving latency time of the instruction.
There is an important difference between the old description and the
automaton based pipeline description.  The latency time is used for all
dependencies when we use the old description.  In the automaton based
pipeline description, the given latency time is only used for true
dependencies.  The cost of anti-dependencies is always zero and the
cost of output dependencies is the difference between latency times of
the producing and consuming insns (if the difference is negative, the
cost is considered to be zero).  You can always change the default
costs for any description by using the target hook
`TARGET_SCHED_ADJUST_COST' (*note Scheduling::).

   INSN-NAME is a string giving the internal name of the insn.  The
internal names are used in constructions `define_bypass' and in the
automaton description file generated for debugging.  The internal name
has nothing in common with the names in `define_insn'.  It is a good
practice to use insn classes described in the processor manual.

   CONDITION defines what RTL insns are described by this construction.
You should remember that you will be in trouble if CONDITION for two
or more different `define_insn_reservation' constructions is TRUE for
an insn.  In this case what reservation will be used for the insn is
not defined.  Such cases are not checked during generation of the
pipeline hazards recognizer because in general recognizing that two
conditions may have the same value is quite difficult (especially if
the conditions contain `symbol_ref').  It is also not checked during the
pipeline hazard recognizer work because it would slow down the
recognizer considerably.

   REGEXP is a string describing the reservation of the cpu's functional
units by the instruction.  The reservations are described by a regular
expression according to the following syntax:

            regexp = regexp "," oneof
                   | oneof

            oneof = oneof "|" allof
                  | allof

            allof = allof "+" repeat
                  | repeat

            repeat = element "*" number
                   | element

            element = cpu_function_unit_name
                    | reservation_name
                    | result_name
                    | "nothing"
                    | "(" regexp ")"

   * `,' is used for describing the start of the next cycle in the
     reservation.

   * `|' is used for describing a reservation described by the first
     regular expression *or* a reservation described by the second
     regular expression *or* etc.

   * `+' is used for describing a reservation described by the first
     regular expression *and* a reservation described by the second
     regular expression *and* etc.

   * `*' is used for convenience and simply means a sequence in which
     the regular expression are repeated NUMBER times with cycle
     advancing (see `,').

   * `cpu_function_unit_name' denotes reservation of the named
     functional unit.

   * `reservation_name' -- see description of construction
     `define_reservation'.

   * `nothing' denotes no unit reservations.

   Sometimes unit reservations for different insns contain common parts.
In such case, you can simplify the pipeline description by describing
the common part by the following construction

     (define_reservation RESERVATION-NAME REGEXP)

   RESERVATION-NAME is a string giving name of REGEXP.  Functional unit
names and reservation names are in the same name space.  So the
reservation names should be different from the functional unit names
and can not be the reserved name `nothing'.

   The following construction is used to describe exceptions in the
latency time for given instruction pair.  This is so called bypasses.

     (define_bypass NUMBER OUT_INSN_NAMES IN_INSN_NAMES
                    [GUARD])

   NUMBER defines when the result generated by the instructions given
in string OUT_INSN_NAMES will be ready for the instructions given in
string IN_INSN_NAMES.  The instructions in the string are separated by
commas.

   GUARD is an optional string giving the name of a C function which
defines an additional guard for the bypass.  The function will get the
two insns as parameters.  If the function returns zero the bypass will
be ignored for this case.  The additional guard is necessary to
recognize complicated bypasses, e.g. when the consumer is only an
address of insn `store' (not a stored value).

   The following five constructions are usually used to describe VLIW
processors, or more precisely, to describe a placement of small
instructions into VLIW instruction slots.  They can be used for RISC
processors, too.

     (exclusion_set UNIT-NAMES UNIT-NAMES)
     (presence_set UNIT-NAMES PATTERNS)
     (final_presence_set UNIT-NAMES PATTERNS)
     (absence_set UNIT-NAMES PATTERNS)
     (final_absence_set UNIT-NAMES PATTERNS)

   UNIT-NAMES is a string giving names of functional units separated by
commas.

   PATTERNS is a string giving patterns of functional units separated
by comma.  Currently pattern is is one unit or units separated by
white-spaces.

   The first construction (`exclusion_set') means that each functional
unit in the first string can not be reserved simultaneously with a unit
whose name is in the second string and vice versa.  For example, the
construction is useful for describing processors (e.g. some SPARC
processors) with a fully pipelined floating point functional unit which
can execute simultaneously only single floating point insns or only
double floating point insns.

   The second construction (`presence_set') means that each functional
unit in the first string can not be reserved unless at least one of
pattern of units whose names are in the second string is reserved.
This is an asymmetric relation.  For example, it is useful for
description that VLIW `slot1' is reserved after `slot0' reservation.
We could describe it by the following construction

     (presence_set "slot1" "slot0")

   Or `slot1' is reserved only after `slot0' and unit `b0' reservation.
In this case we could write

     (presence_set "slot1" "slot0 b0")

   The third construction (`final_presence_set') is analogous to
`presence_set'.  The difference between them is when checking is done.
When an instruction is issued in given automaton state reflecting all
current and planned unit reservations, the automaton state is changed.
The first state is a source state, the second one is a result state.
Checking for `presence_set' is done on the source state reservation,
checking for `final_presence_set' is done on the result reservation.
This construction is useful to describe a reservation which is actually
two subsequent reservations.  For example, if we use

     (presence_set "slot1" "slot0")

   the following insn will be never issued (because `slot1' requires
`slot0' which is absent in the source state).

     (define_reservation "insn_and_nop" "slot0 + slot1")

   but it can be issued if we use analogous `final_presence_set'.

   The forth construction (`absence_set') means that each functional
unit in the first string can be reserved only if each pattern of units
whose names are in the second string is not reserved.  This is an
asymmetric relation (actually `exclusion_set' is analogous to this one
but it is symmetric).  For example, it is useful for description that
VLIW `slot0' can not be reserved after `slot1' or `slot2' reservation.
We could describe it by the following construction

     (absence_set "slot2" "slot0, slot1")

   Or `slot2' can not be reserved if `slot0' and unit `b0' are reserved
or `slot1' and unit `b1' are reserved.  In this case we could write

     (absence_set "slot2" "slot0 b0, slot1 b1")

   All functional units mentioned in a set should belong to the same
automaton.

   The last construction (`final_absence_set') is analogous to
`absence_set' but checking is done on the result (state) reservation.
See comments for `final_presence_set'.

   You can control the generator of the pipeline hazard recognizer with
the following construction.

     (automata_option OPTIONS)

   OPTIONS is a string giving options which affect the generated code.
Currently there are the following options:

   * "no-minimization" makes no minimization of the automaton.  This is
     only worth to do when we are debugging the description and need to
     look more accurately at reservations of states.

   * "time" means printing additional time statistics about generation
     of automata.

   * "v" means a generation of the file describing the result automata.
     The file has suffix `.dfa' and can be used for the description
     verification and debugging.

   * "w" means a generation of warning instead of error for
     non-critical errors.

   * "ndfa" makes nondeterministic finite state automata.  This affects
     the treatment of operator `|' in the regular expressions.  The
     usual treatment of the operator is to try the first alternative
     and, if the reservation is not possible, the second alternative.
     The nondeterministic treatment means trying all alternatives, some
     of them may be rejected by reservations in the subsequent insns.
     You can not query functional unit reservations in nondeterministic
     automaton states.

   * "progress" means output of a progress bar showing how many states
     were generated so far for automaton being processed.  This is
     useful during debugging a DFA description.  If you see too many
     generated states, you could interrupt the generator of the pipeline
     hazard recognizer and try to figure out a reason for generation of
     the huge automaton.

   As an example, consider a superscalar RISC machine which can issue
three insns (two integer insns and one floating point insn) on the
cycle but can finish only two insns.  To describe this, we define the
following functional units.

     (define_cpu_unit "i0_pipeline, i1_pipeline, f_pipeline")
     (define_cpu_unit "port0, port1")

   All simple integer insns can be executed in any integer pipeline and
their result is ready in two cycles.  The simple integer insns are
issued into the first pipeline unless it is reserved, otherwise they
are issued into the second pipeline.  Integer division and
multiplication insns can be executed only in the second integer
pipeline and their results are ready correspondingly in 8 and 4 cycles.
The integer division is not pipelined, i.e. the subsequent integer
division insn can not be issued until the current division insn
finished.  Floating point insns are fully pipelined and their results
are ready in 3 cycles.  Where the result of a floating point insn is
used by an integer insn, an additional delay of one cycle is incurred.
To describe all of this we could specify

     (define_cpu_unit "div")

     (define_insn_reservation "simple" 2 (eq_attr "type" "int")
                              "(i0_pipeline | i1_pipeline), (port0 | port1)")

     (define_insn_reservation "mult" 4 (eq_attr "type" "mult")
                              "i1_pipeline, nothing*2, (port0 | port1)")

     (define_insn_reservation "div" 8 (eq_attr "type" "div")
                              "i1_pipeline, div*7, div + (port0 | port1)")

     (define_insn_reservation "float" 3 (eq_attr "type" "float")
                              "f_pipeline, nothing, (port0 | port1))

     (define_bypass 4 "float" "simple,mult,div")

   To simplify the description we could describe the following
reservation

     (define_reservation "finish" "port0|port1")

   and use it in all `define_insn_reservation' as in the following
construction

     (define_insn_reservation "simple" 2 (eq_attr "type" "int")
                              "(i0_pipeline | i1_pipeline), finish")

10.18.8.3 Drawbacks of the old pipeline description
...................................................

The old instruction level parallelism description and the pipeline
hazards recognizer based on it have the following drawbacks in
comparison with the DFA-based ones:

   * Each functional unit is believed to be reserved at the instruction
     execution start.  This is a very inaccurate model for modern
     processors.

   * An inadequate description of instruction latency times.  The
     latency time is bound with a functional unit reserved by an
     instruction not with the instruction itself.  In other words, the
     description is oriented to describe at most one unit reservation
     by each instruction.  It also does not permit to describe special
     bypasses between instruction pairs.

   * The implementation of the pipeline hazard recognizer interface has
     constraints on number of functional units.  This is a number of
     bits in integer on the host machine.

   * The interface to the pipeline hazard recognizer is more complex
     than one to the automaton based pipeline recognizer.

   * An unnatural description when you write a unit and a condition
     which selects instructions using the unit.  Writing all unit
     reservations for an instruction (an instruction class) is more
     natural.

   * The recognition of the interlock delays has a slow implementation.
     The GCC scheduler supports structures which describe the unit
     reservations.  The more functional units a processor has, the
     slower its pipeline hazard recognizer will be.  Such an
     implementation would become even slower when we allowed to reserve
     functional units not only at the instruction execution start.  In
     an automaton based pipeline hazard recognizer, speed is not
     dependent on processor complexity.

10.19 Conditional Execution
===========================

A number of architectures provide for some form of conditional
execution, or predication.  The hallmark of this feature is the ability
to nullify most of the instructions in the instruction set.  When the
instruction set is large and not entirely symmetric, it can be quite
tedious to describe these forms directly in the `.md' file.  An
alternative is the `define_cond_exec' template.

     (define_cond_exec
       [PREDICATE-PATTERN]
       "CONDITION"
       "OUTPUT-TEMPLATE")

   PREDICATE-PATTERN is the condition that must be true for the insn to
be executed at runtime and should match a relational operator.  One can
use `match_operator' to match several relational operators at once.
Any `match_operand' operands must have no more than one alternative.

   CONDITION is a C expression that must be true for the generated
pattern to match.

   OUTPUT-TEMPLATE is a string similar to the `define_insn' output
template (*note Output Template::), except that the `*' and `@' special
cases do not apply.  This is only useful if the assembly text for the
predicate is a simple prefix to the main insn.  In order to handle the
general case, there is a global variable `current_insn_predicate' that
will contain the entire predicate if the current insn is predicated,
and will otherwise be `NULL'.

   When `define_cond_exec' is used, an implicit reference to the
`predicable' instruction attribute is made.  *Note Insn Attributes::.
This attribute must be boolean (i.e. have exactly two elements in its
LIST-OF-VALUES).  Further, it must not be used with complex
expressions.  That is, the default and all uses in the insns must be a
simple constant, not dependent on the alternative or anything else.

   For each `define_insn' for which the `predicable' attribute is true,
a new `define_insn' pattern will be generated that matches a predicated
version of the instruction.  For example,

     (define_insn "addsi"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "r")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "r")))]
       "TEST1"
       "add %2,%1,%0")

     (define_cond_exec
       [(ne (match_operand:CC 0 "register_operand" "c")
            (const_int 0))]
       "TEST2"
       "(%0)")

generates a new pattern

     (define_insn ""
       [(cond_exec
          (ne (match_operand:CC 3 "register_operand" "c") (const_int 0))
          (set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "r")
               (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r")
                        (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "r"))))]
       "(TEST2) && (TEST1)"
       "(%3) add %2,%1,%0")


File: gccint.info,  Node: Constant Definitions,  Prev: Conditional Execution,  Up: Machine Desc

10.20 Constant Definitions
==========================

Using literal constants inside instruction patterns reduces legibility
and can be a maintenance problem.

   To overcome this problem, you may use the `define_constants'
expression.  It contains a vector of name-value pairs.  From that point
on, wherever any of the names appears in the MD file, it is as if the
corresponding value had been written instead.  You may use
`define_constants' multiple times; each appearance adds more constants
to the table.  It is an error to redefine a constant with a different
value.

   To come back to the a29k load multiple example, instead of

     (define_insn ""
       [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
          [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
                (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
           (use (reg:SI 179))
           (clobber (reg:SI 179))])]
       ""
       "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")

   You could write:

     (define_constants [
         (R_BP 177)
         (R_FC 178)
         (R_CR 179)
         (R_Q  180)
     ])

     (define_insn ""
       [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
          [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
                (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
           (use (reg:SI R_CR))
           (clobber (reg:SI R_CR))])]
       ""
       "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")

   The constants that are defined with a define_constant are also output
in the insn-codes.h header file as #defines.

11 Target Description Macros and Functions
******************************************

In addition to the file `MACHINE.md', a machine description includes a
C header file conventionally given the name `MACHINE.h' and a C source
file named `MACHINE.c'.  The header file defines numerous macros that
convey the information about the target machine that does not fit into
the scheme of the `.md' file.  The file `tm.h' should be a link to
`MACHINE.h'.  The header file `config.h' includes `tm.h' and most
compiler source files include `config.h'.  The source file defines a
variable `targetm', which is a structure containing pointers to
functions and data relating to the target machine.  `MACHINE.c' should
also contain their definitions, if they are not defined elsewhere in
GCC, and other functions called through the macros defined in the `.h'
file.

11.1 The Global `targetm' Variable
==================================

 -- Variable: struct gcc_target targetm
     The target `.c' file must define the global `targetm' variable
     which contains pointers to functions and data relating to the
     target machine.  The variable is declared in `target.h';
     `target-def.h' defines the macro `TARGET_INITIALIZER' which is
     used to initialize the variable, and macros for the default
     initializers for elements of the structure.  The `.c' file should
     override those macros for which the default definition is
     inappropriate.  For example:
          #include "target.h"
          #include "target-def.h"

          /* Initialize the GCC target structure.  */

          #undef TARGET_COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES
          #define TARGET_COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES MACHINE_comp_type_attributes

          struct gcc_target targetm = TARGET_INITIALIZER;

Where a macro should be defined in the `.c' file in this manner to form
part of the `targetm' structure, it is documented below as a "Target
Hook" with a prototype.  Many macros will change in future from being
defined in the `.h' file to being part of the `targetm' structure.

11.2 Controlling the Compilation Driver, `gcc'
==============================================

You can control the compilation driver.

 -- Macro: SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (CHAR)
     A C expression which determines whether the option `-CHAR' takes
     arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
     option takes-zero, for many options.

     By default, this macro is defined as `DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG',
     which handles the standard options properly.  You need not define
     `SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' unless you wish to add additional options which
     take arguments.  Any redefinition should call
     `DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' and then check for additional options.

 -- Macro: WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (NAME)
     A C expression which determines whether the option `-NAME' takes
     arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
     option takes-zero, for many options.  This macro rather than
     `SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' is used for multi-character option names.

     By default, this macro is defined as
     `DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG', which handles the standard options
     properly.  You need not define `WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' unless you
     wish to add additional options which take arguments.  Any
     redefinition should call `DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' and then
     check for additional options.

 -- Macro: SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION (CHAR)
     A C expression which determines whether the option `-CHAR' stops
     compilation before the generation of an executable.  The value is
     boolean, nonzero if the option does stop an executable from being
     generated, zero otherwise.

     By default, this macro is defined as
     `DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION', which handles the standard
     options properly.  You need not define
     `SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION' unless you wish to add additional
     options which affect the generation of an executable.  Any
     redefinition should call `DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION' and
     then check for additional options.

 -- Macro: SWITCHES_NEED_SPACES
     A string-valued C expression which enumerates the options for which
     the linker needs a space between the option and its argument.

     If this macro is not defined, the default value is `""'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OPTION_TRANSLATE_TABLE
     If defined, a list of pairs of strings, the first of which is a
     potential command line target to the `gcc' driver program, and the
     second of which is a space-separated (tabs and other whitespace
     are not supported) list of options with which to replace the first
     option.  The target defining this list is responsible for assuring
     that the results are valid.  Replacement options may not be the
     `--opt' style, they must be the `-opt' style.  It is the intention
     of this macro to provide a mechanism for substitution that affects
     the multilibs chosen, such as one option that enables many
     options, some of which select multilibs.  Example nonsensical
     definition, where `-malt-abi', `-EB', and `-mspoo' cause different
     multilibs to be chosen:

          #define TARGET_OPTION_TRANSLATE_TABLE \
          { "-fast",   "-march=fast-foo -malt-abi -I/usr/fast-foo" }, \
          { "-compat", "-EB -malign=4 -mspoo" }

 -- Macro: DRIVER_SELF_SPECS
     A list of specs for the driver itself.  It should be a suitable
     initializer for an array of strings, with no surrounding braces.

     The driver applies these specs to its own command line between
     loading default `specs' files (but not command-line specified
     ones) and choosing the multilib directory or running any
     subcommands.  It applies them in the order given, so each spec can
     depend on the options added by earlier ones.  It is also possible
     to remove options using `%<OPTION' in the usual way.

     This macro can be useful when a port has several interdependent
     target options.  It provides a way of standardizing the command
     line so that the other specs are easier to write.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: OPTION_DEFAULT_SPECS
     A list of specs used to support configure-time default options
     (i.e.  `--with' options) in the driver.  It should be a suitable
     initializer for an array of structures, each containing two
     strings, without the outermost pair of surrounding braces.

     The first item in the pair is the name of the default.  This must
     match the code in `config.gcc' for the target.  The second item is
     a spec to apply if a default with this name was specified.  The
     string `%(VALUE)' in the spec will be replaced by the value of the
     default everywhere it occurs.

     The driver will apply these specs to its own command line between
     loading default `specs' files and processing `DRIVER_SELF_SPECS',
     using the same mechanism as `DRIVER_SELF_SPECS'.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: CPP_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to CPP.  It can also specify how to translate options you
     give to GCC into options for GCC to pass to the CPP.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: CPLUSPLUS_CPP_SPEC
     This macro is just like `CPP_SPEC', but is used for C++, rather
     than C.  If you do not define this macro, then the value of
     `CPP_SPEC' (if any) will be used instead.

 -- Macro: CC1_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to `cc1', `cc1plus', `f771', and the other language front
     ends.  It can also specify how to translate options you give to
     GCC into options for GCC to pass to front ends.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: CC1PLUS_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to `cc1plus'.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GCC into options for GCC to pass to the `cc1plus'.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.  Note
     that everything defined in CC1_SPEC is already passed to `cc1plus'
     so there is no need to duplicate the contents of CC1_SPEC in
     CC1PLUS_SPEC.

 -- Macro: ASM_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to the assembler.  It can also specify how to translate
     options you give to GCC into options for GCC to pass to the
     assembler.  See the file `sun3.h' for an example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: ASM_FINAL_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program how to run
     any programs which cleanup after the normal assembler.  Normally,
     this is not needed.  See the file `mips.h' for an example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: AS_NEEDS_DASH_FOR_PIPED_INPUT
     Define this macro, with no value, if the driver should give the
     assembler an argument consisting of a single dash, `-', to
     instruct it to read from its standard input (which will be a pipe
     connected to the output of the compiler proper).  This argument is
     given after any `-o' option specifying the name of the output file.

     If you do not define this macro, the assembler is assumed to read
     its standard input if given no non-option arguments.  If your
     assembler cannot read standard input at all, use a `%{pipe:%e}'
     construct; see `mips.h' for instance.

 -- Macro: LINK_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to the linker.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GCC into options for GCC to pass to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: LIB_SPEC
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `LIB_SPEC' is used at the end
     of the command given to the linker.

     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
     standard C library from the usual place.  See `gcc.c'.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC_SPEC
     Another C string constant that tells the GCC driver program how
     and when to place a reference to `libgcc.a' into the linker
     command line.  This constant is placed both before and after the
     value of `LIB_SPEC'.

     If this macro is not defined, the GCC driver provides a default
     that passes the string `-lgcc' to the linker.

     By default, if `ENABLE_SHARED_LIBGCC' is defined, the
     `LIBGCC_SPEC' is not directly used by the driver program but is
     instead modified to refer to different versions of `libgcc.a'
     depending on the values of the command line flags `-static',
     `-shared', `-static-libgcc', and `-shared-libgcc'.

 -- Macro: USE_LD_AS_NEEDED
     A macro that controls the modifications to `LIBGCC_SPEC'.  If
     nonzero, a spec will be generated that uses -as-needed and the
     shared libgcc in place of the static exception handler library,
     when linking without any of `-static', `-static-libgcc', or
     `-shared-libgcc'.

 -- Macro: LINK_EH_SPEC
     If defined, this C string constant is added to `LINK_SPEC'.  When
     `USE_LD_AS_NEEDED' is zero or undefined, it also affects the
     modifications to `LIBGCC_SPEC'.

 -- Macro: STARTFILE_SPEC
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `STARTFILE_SPEC' is used at the
     very beginning of the command given to the linker.

     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
     standard C startup file from the usual place.  See `gcc.c'.

 -- Macro: ENDFILE_SPEC
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `ENDFILE_SPEC' is used at the
     very end of the command given to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: THREAD_MODEL_SPEC
     GCC `-v' will print the thread model GCC was configured to use.
     However, this doesn't work on platforms that are multilibbed on
     thread models, such as AIX 4.3.  On such platforms, define
     `THREAD_MODEL_SPEC' such that it evaluates to a string without
     blanks that names one of the recognized thread models.  `%*', the
     default value of this macro, will expand to the value of
     `thread_file' set in `config.gcc'.

 -- Macro: SYSROOT_SUFFIX_SPEC
     Define this macro to add a suffix to the target sysroot when GCC is
     configured with a sysroot.  This will cause GCC to search for
     usr/lib, et al, within sysroot+suffix.

 -- Macro: SYSROOT_HEADERS_SUFFIX_SPEC
     Define this macro to add a headers_suffix to the target sysroot
     when GCC is configured with a sysroot.  This will cause GCC to
     pass the updated sysroot+headers_suffix to CPP, causing it to
     search for usr/include, et al, within sysroot+headers_suffix.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_SPECS
     Define this macro to provide additional specifications to put in
     the `specs' file that can be used in various specifications like
     `CC1_SPEC'.

     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures,
     containing a string constant, that defines the specification name,
     and a string constant that provides the specification.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

     `EXTRA_SPECS' is useful when an architecture contains several
     related targets, which have various `..._SPECS' which are similar
     to each other, and the maintainer would like one central place to
     keep these definitions.

     For example, the PowerPC System V.4 targets use `EXTRA_SPECS' to
     define either `_CALL_SYSV' when the System V calling sequence is
     used or `_CALL_AIX' when the older AIX-based calling sequence is
     used.

     The `config/rs6000/rs6000.h' target file defines:

          #define EXTRA_SPECS \
            { "cpp_sysv_default", CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT },

          #define CPP_SYS_DEFAULT ""

     The `config/rs6000/sysv.h' target file defines:
          #undef CPP_SPEC
          #define CPP_SPEC \
          "%{posix: -D_POSIX_SOURCE } \
          %{mcall-sysv: -D_CALL_SYSV } \
          %{!mcall-sysv: %(cpp_sysv_default) } \
          %{msoft-float: -D_SOFT_FLOAT} %{mcpu=403: -D_SOFT_FLOAT}"

          #undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
          #define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_SYSV"

     while the `config/rs6000/eabiaix.h' target file defines
     `CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT' as:

          #undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
          #define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_AIX"

 -- Macro: LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL
     Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
     `libgcc.a' itself and should not pass `-L' options to the linker.
     If you do not define this macro, the driver program will pass the
     argument `-lgcc' to tell the linker to do the search and will pass
     `-L' options to it.

 -- Macro: LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL_1
     Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
     `libgcc.a'.  If you do not define this macro, the driver program
     will pass the argument `-lgcc' to tell the linker to do the search.
     This macro is similar to `LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL', except that it does
     not affect `-L' options.

 -- Macro: LINK_GCC_C_SEQUENCE_SPEC
     The sequence in which libgcc and libc are specified to the linker.
     By default this is `%G %L %G'.

 -- Macro: LINK_COMMAND_SPEC
     A C string constant giving the complete command line need to
     execute the linker.  When you do this, you will need to update
     your port each time a change is made to the link command line
     within `gcc.c'.  Therefore, define this macro only if you need to
     completely redefine the command line for invoking the linker and
     there is no other way to accomplish the effect you need.
     Overriding this macro may be avoidable by overriding
     `LINK_GCC_C_SEQUENCE_SPEC' instead.

 -- Macro: LINK_ELIMINATE_DUPLICATE_LDIRECTORIES
     A nonzero value causes `collect2' to remove duplicate
     `-LDIRECTORY' search directories from linking commands.  Do not
     give it a nonzero value if removing duplicate search directories
     changes the linker's semantics.

 -- Macro: MULTILIB_DEFAULTS
     Define this macro as a C expression for the initializer of an
     array of string to tell the driver program which options are
     defaults for this target and thus do not need to be handled
     specially when using `MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.

     Do not define this macro if `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is not defined in
     the target makefile fragment or if none of the options listed in
     `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' are set by default.  *Note Target Fragment::.

 -- Macro: RELATIVE_PREFIX_NOT_LINKDIR
     Define this macro to tell `gcc' that it should only translate a
     `-B' prefix into a `-L' linker option if the prefix indicates an
     absolute file name.

 -- Macro: MD_EXEC_PREFIX
     If defined, this macro is an additional prefix to try after
     `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.  `MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
     `-b' option is used, or the compiler is built as a cross compiler.
     If you define `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', then be sure to add it to the
     list of directories used to find the assembler in `configure.in'.

 -- Macro: STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `libdir' as the default prefix to try when
     searching for startup files such as `crt0.o'.
     `STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX' is not searched when the compiler is
     built as a cross compiler.

 -- Macro: MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX
     If defined, this macro supplies an additional prefix to try after
     the standard prefixes.  `MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
     `-b' option is used, or when the compiler is built as a cross
     compiler.

 -- Macro: MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1
     If defined, this macro supplies yet another prefix to try after the
     standard prefixes.  It is not searched when the `-b' option is
     used, or when the compiler is built as a cross compiler.

 -- Macro: INIT_ENVIRONMENT
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to set
     environment variables for programs called by the driver, such as
     the assembler and loader.  The driver passes the value of this
     macro to `putenv' to initialize the necessary environment
     variables.

 -- Macro: LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/local/include' as the default prefix
     to try when searching for local header files.  `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'
     comes before `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR' in the search order.

     Cross compilers do not search either `/usr/local/include' or its
     replacement.

 -- Macro: MODIFY_TARGET_NAME
     Define this macro if you wish to define command-line switches that
     modify the default target name.

     For each switch, you can include a string to be appended to the
     first part of the configuration name or a string to be deleted
     from the configuration name, if present.  The definition should be
     an initializer for an array of structures.  Each array element
     should have three elements: the switch name (a string constant,
     including the initial dash), one of the enumeration codes `ADD' or
     `DELETE' to indicate whether the string should be inserted or
     deleted, and the string to be inserted or deleted (a string
     constant).

     For example, on a machine where `64' at the end of the
     configuration name denotes a 64-bit target and you want the `-32'
     and `-64' switches to select between 32- and 64-bit targets, you
     would code

          #define MODIFY_TARGET_NAME \
            { { "-32", DELETE, "64"}, \
               {"-64", ADD, "64"}}

 -- Macro: SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to specify a
     system-specific directory to search for header files before the
     standard directory.  `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR' comes before
     `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR' in the search order.

     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search the
     directory specified.

 -- Macro: STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/include' as the default prefix to try
     when searching for header files.

     Cross compilers ignore this macro and do not search either
     `/usr/include' or its replacement.

 -- Macro: STANDARD_INCLUDE_COMPONENT
     The "component" corresponding to `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'.  See
     `INCLUDE_DEFAULTS', below, for the description of components.  If
     you do not define this macro, no component is used.

 -- Macro: INCLUDE_DEFAULTS
     Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default
     search path for include files.  For a native compiler, the default
     search path usually consists of `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR',
     `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR', `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR',
     `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR', and `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'.  In addition,
     `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' and `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' are defined
     automatically by `Makefile', and specify private search areas for
     GCC.  The directory `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for C++
     programs.

     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures.
     Each array element should have four elements: the directory name (a
     string constant), the component name (also a string constant), a
     flag for C++-only directories, and a flag showing that the
     includes in the directory don't need to be wrapped in `extern `C''
     when compiling C++.  Mark the end of the array with a null element.

     The component name denotes what GNU package the include file is
     part of, if any, in all uppercase letters.  For example, it might
     be `GCC' or `BINUTILS'.  If the package is part of a
     vendor-supplied operating system, code the component name as `0'.

     For example, here is the definition used for VAX/VMS:

          #define INCLUDE_DEFAULTS \
          {                                       \
            { "GNU_GXX_INCLUDE:", "G++", 1, 1},   \
            { "GNU_CC_INCLUDE:", "GCC", 0, 0},    \
            { "SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]", 0, 0, 0},  \
            { ".", 0, 0, 0},                      \
            { 0, 0, 0, 0}                         \
          }

   Here is the order of prefixes tried for exec files:

  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with `-B'.

  2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
     `COMPILER_PATH'.

  4. The macro `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.

  5. `/usr/lib/gcc/'.

  6. The macro `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

   Here is the order of prefixes tried for startfiles:

  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with `-B'.

  2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
     `LIBRARY_PATH' (or port-specific name; native only, cross
     compilers do not use this).

  4. The macro `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.

  5. `/usr/lib/gcc/'.

  6. The macro `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  7. The macro `MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX', if any.

  8. The macro `STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'.

  9. `/lib/'.

 10. `/usr/lib/'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Run-time Target,  Next: Per-Function Data,  Prev: Driver,  Up: Target Macros

11.3 Run-time Target Specification
==================================

Here are run-time target specifications.

 -- Macro: TARGET_CPU_CPP_BUILTINS ()
     This function-like macro expands to a block of code that defines
     built-in preprocessor macros and assertions for the target cpu,
     using the functions `builtin_define', `builtin_define_std' and
     `builtin_assert'.  When the front end calls this macro it provides
     a trailing semicolon, and since it has finished command line
     option processing your code can use those results freely.

     `builtin_assert' takes a string in the form you pass to the
     command-line option `-A', such as `cpu=mips', and creates the
     assertion.  `builtin_define' takes a string in the form accepted
     by option `-D' and unconditionally defines the macro.

     `builtin_define_std' takes a string representing the name of an
     object-like macro.  If it doesn't lie in the user's namespace,
     `builtin_define_std' defines it unconditionally.  Otherwise, it
     defines a version with two leading underscores, and another version
     with two leading and trailing underscores, and defines the original
     only if an ISO standard was not requested on the command line.  For
     example, passing `unix' defines `__unix', `__unix__' and possibly
     `unix'; passing `_mips' defines `__mips', `__mips__' and possibly
     `_mips', and passing `_ABI64' defines only `_ABI64'.

     You can also test for the C dialect being compiled.  The variable
     `c_language' is set to one of `clk_c', `clk_cplusplus' or
     `clk_objective_c'.  Note that if we are preprocessing assembler,
     this variable will be `clk_c' but the function-like macro
     `preprocessing_asm_p()' will return true, so you might want to
     check for that first.  If you need to check for strict ANSI, the
     variable `flag_iso' can be used.  The function-like macro
     `preprocessing_trad_p()' can be used to check for traditional
     preprocessing.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OS_CPP_BUILTINS ()
     Similarly to `TARGET_CPU_CPP_BUILTINS' but this macro is optional
     and is used for the target operating system instead.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OBJFMT_CPP_BUILTINS ()
     Similarly to `TARGET_CPU_CPP_BUILTINS' but this macro is optional
     and is used for the target object format.  `elfos.h' uses this
     macro to define `__ELF__', so you probably do not need to define
     it yourself.

 -- Variable: extern int target_flags
     This declaration should be present.

 -- Macro: TARGET_FEATURENAME
     This series of macros is to allow compiler command arguments to
     enable or disable the use of optional features of the target
     machine.  For example, one machine description serves both the
     68000 and the 68020; a command argument tells the compiler whether
     it should use 68020-only instructions or not.  This command
     argument works by means of a macro `TARGET_68020' that tests a bit
     in `target_flags'.

     Define a macro `TARGET_FEATURENAME' for each such option.  Its
     definition should test a bit in `target_flags'.  It is recommended
     that a helper macro `MASK_FEATURENAME' is defined for each
     bit-value to test, and used in `TARGET_FEATURENAME' and
     `TARGET_SWITCHES'.  For example:

          #define TARGET_MASK_68020 1
          #define TARGET_68020 (target_flags & MASK_68020)

     One place where these macros are used is in the
     condition-expressions of instruction patterns.  Note how
     `TARGET_68020' appears frequently in the 68000 machine description
     file, `m68k.md'.  Another place they are used is in the
     definitions of the other macros in the `MACHINE.h' file.

 -- Macro: TARGET_SWITCHES
     This macro defines names of command options to set and clear bits
     in `target_flags'.  Its definition is an initializer with a
     subgrouping for each command option.

     Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
     option name, a number, which contains the bits to set in
     `target_flags', and a second string which is the description
     displayed by `--help'.  If the number is negative then the bits
     specified by the number are cleared instead of being set.  If the
     description string is present but empty, then no help information
     will be displayed for that option, but it will not count as an
     undocumented option.  The actual option name is made by appending
     `-m' to the specified name.  Non-empty description strings should
     be marked with `N_(...)' for `xgettext'.  Please do not mark empty
     strings because the empty string is reserved by GNU gettext.
     `gettext("")' returns the header entry of the message catalog with
     meta information, not the empty string.

     In addition to the description for `--help', more detailed
     documentation for each option should be added to `invoke.texi'.

     One of the subgroupings should have a null string.  The number in
     this grouping is the default value for `target_flags'.  Any target
     options act starting with that value.

     Here is an example which defines `-m68000' and `-m68020' with
     opposite meanings, and picks the latter as the default:

          #define TARGET_SWITCHES \
            { { "68020", MASK_68020, "" },     \
              { "68000", -MASK_68020,          \
                N_("Compile for the 68000") }, \
              { "", MASK_68020, "" },          \
            }

 -- Macro: TARGET_OPTIONS
     This macro is similar to `TARGET_SWITCHES' but defines names of
     command options that have values.  Its definition is an
     initializer with a subgrouping for each command option.

     Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
     option name, the address of a variable, a description string, and
     a value.  Non-empty description strings should be marked with
     `N_(...)' for `xgettext'.  Please do not mark empty strings
     because the empty string is reserved by GNU gettext. `gettext("")'
     returns the header entry of the message catalog with meta
     information, not the empty string.

     If the value listed in the table is `NULL', then the variable, type
     `char *', is set to the variable part of the given option if the
     fixed part matches.  In other words, if the first part of the
     option matches what's in the table, the variable will be set to
     point to the rest of the option.  This allows the user to specify
     a value for that option.  The actual option name is made by
     appending `-m' to the specified name.  Again, each option should
     also be documented in `invoke.texi'.

     If the value listed in the table is non-`NULL', then the option
     must match the option in the table exactly (with `-m'), and the
     variable is set to point to the value listed in the table.

     Here is an example which defines `-mshort-data-NUMBER'.  If the
     given option is `-mshort-data-512', the variable `m88k_short_data'
     will be set to the string `"512"'.

          extern char *m88k_short_data;
          #define TARGET_OPTIONS \
           { { "short-data-", &m88k_short_data, \
               N_("Specify the size of the short data section"), 0 } }

     Here is a variant of the above that allows the user to also specify
     just `-mshort-data' where a default of `"64"' is used.

          extern char *m88k_short_data;
          #define TARGET_OPTIONS \
           { { "short-data-", &m88k_short_data, \
               N_("Specify the size of the short data section"), 0 } \
              { "short-data", &m88k_short_data, "", "64" },
              }

     Here is an example which defines `-mno-alu', `-malu1', and
     `-malu2' as a three-state switch, along with suitable macros for
     checking the state of the option (documentation is elided for
     brevity).

          [chip.c]
          char *chip_alu = ""; /* Specify default here.  */

          [chip.h]
          extern char *chip_alu;
          #define TARGET_OPTIONS \
            { { "no-alu", &chip_alu, "", "" }, \
               { "alu1", &chip_alu, "", "1" }, \
               { "alu2", &chip_alu, "", "2" }, }
          #define TARGET_ALU (chip_alu[0] != '\0')
          #define TARGET_ALU1 (chip_alu[0] == '1')
          #define TARGET_ALU2 (chip_alu[0] == '2')

 -- Macro: TARGET_VERSION
     This macro is a C statement to print on `stderr' a string
     describing the particular machine description choice.  Every
     machine description should define `TARGET_VERSION'.  For example:

          #ifdef MOTOROLA
          #define TARGET_VERSION \
            fprintf (stderr, " (68k, Motorola syntax)");
          #else
          #define TARGET_VERSION \
            fprintf (stderr, " (68k, MIT syntax)");
          #endif

 -- Macro: OVERRIDE_OPTIONS
     Sometimes certain combinations of command options do not make
     sense on a particular target machine.  You can define a macro
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS' to take account of this.  This macro, if
     defined, is executed once just after all the command options have
     been parsed.

     Don't use this macro to turn on various extra optimizations for
     `-O'.  That is what `OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS' is for.

 -- Macro: OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS (LEVEL, SIZE)
     Some machines may desire to change what optimizations are
     performed for various optimization levels.   This macro, if
     defined, is executed once just after the optimization level is
     determined and before the remainder of the command options have
     been parsed.  Values set in this macro are used as the default
     values for the other command line options.

     LEVEL is the optimization level specified; 2 if `-O2' is
     specified, 1 if `-O' is specified, and 0 if neither is specified.

     SIZE is nonzero if `-Os' is specified and zero otherwise.

     You should not use this macro to change options that are not
     machine-specific.  These should uniformly selected by the same
     optimization level on all supported machines.  Use this macro to
     enable machine-specific optimizations.

     *Do not examine `write_symbols' in this macro!* The debugging
     options are not supposed to alter the generated code.

 -- Macro: CAN_DEBUG_WITHOUT_FP
     Define this macro if debugging can be performed even without a
     frame pointer.  If this macro is defined, GCC will turn on the
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' option whenever `-O' is specified.

11.4 Defining data structures for per-function information.
===========================================================

If the target needs to store information on a per-function basis, GCC
provides a macro and a couple of variables to allow this.  Note, just
using statics to store the information is a bad idea, since GCC supports
nested functions, so you can be halfway through encoding one function
when another one comes along.

   GCC defines a data structure called `struct function' which contains
all of the data specific to an individual function.  This structure
contains a field called `machine' whose type is `struct
machine_function *', which can be used by targets to point to their own
specific data.

   If a target needs per-function specific data it should define the
type `struct machine_function' and also the macro `INIT_EXPANDERS'.
This macro should be used to initialize the function pointer
`init_machine_status'.  This pointer is explained below.

   One typical use of per-function, target specific data is to create an
RTX to hold the register containing the function's return address.  This
RTX can then be used to implement the `__builtin_return_address'
function, for level 0.

   Note--earlier implementations of GCC used a single data area to hold
all of the per-function information.  Thus when processing of a nested
function began the old per-function data had to be pushed onto a stack,
and when the processing was finished, it had to be popped off the
stack.  GCC used to provide function pointers called
`save_machine_status' and `restore_machine_status' to handle the saving
and restoring of the target specific information.  Since the single
data area approach is no longer used, these pointers are no longer
supported.

 -- Macro: INIT_EXPANDERS
     Macro called to initialize any target specific information.  This
     macro is called once per function, before generation of any RTL
     has begun.  The intention of this macro is to allow the
     initialization of the function pointer `init_machine_status'.

 -- Variable: void (*)(struct function *) init_machine_status
     If this function pointer is non-`NULL' it will be called once per
     function, before function compilation starts, in order to allow the
     target to perform any target specific initialization of the
     `struct function' structure.  It is intended that this would be
     used to initialize the `machine' of that structure.

     `struct machine_function' structures are expected to be freed by
     GC.  Generally, any memory that they reference must be allocated
     by using `ggc_alloc', including the structure itself.

11.5 Storage Layout
===================

Note that the definitions of the macros in this table which are sizes or
alignments measured in bits do not need to be constant.  They can be C
expressions that refer to static variables, such as the `target_flags'.
*Note Run-time Target::.

 -- Macro: BITS_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant bit
     in a byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to have the
     value zero.  This means that bit-field instructions count from the
     most significant bit.  If the machine has no bit-field
     instructions, then this must still be defined, but it doesn't
     matter which value it is defined to.  This macro need not be a
     constant.

     This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
     bytes or words; that is controlled by `BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'.

 -- Macro: BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant byte
     in a word has the lowest number.  This macro need not be a
     constant.

 -- Macro: WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if, in a multiword object,
     the most significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to
     both memory locations and registers; GCC fundamentally assumes
     that the order of words in memory is the same as the order in
     registers.  This macro need not be a constant.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC2_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro if `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' is not constant.  This
     must be a constant value with the same meaning as
     `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN', which will be used only when compiling
     `libgcc2.c'.  Typically the value will be set based on
     preprocessor defines.

 -- Macro: FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if `DFmode', `XFmode' or
     `TFmode' floating point numbers are stored in memory with the word
     containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise define it
     to have the value 0.  This macro need not be a constant.

     You need not define this macro if the ordering is the same as for
     multi-word integers.

 -- Macro: BITS_PER_UNIT
     Define this macro to be the number of bits in an addressable
     storage unit (byte).  If you do not define this macro the default
     is 8.

 -- Macro: BITS_PER_WORD
     Number of bits in a word.  If you do not define this macro, the
     default is `BITS_PER_UNIT * UNITS_PER_WORD'.

 -- Macro: MAX_BITS_PER_WORD
     Maximum number of bits in a word.  If this is undefined, the
     default is `BITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
     that is the largest value that `BITS_PER_WORD' can have at
     run-time.

 -- Macro: UNITS_PER_WORD
     Number of storage units in a word; normally 4.

 -- Macro: MIN_UNITS_PER_WORD
     Minimum number of units in a word.  If this is undefined, the
     default is `UNITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
     that is the smallest value that `UNITS_PER_WORD' can have at
     run-time.

 -- Macro: POINTER_SIZE
     Width of a pointer, in bits.  You must specify a value no wider
     than the width of `Pmode'.  If it is not equal to the width of
     `Pmode', you must define `POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED'.  If you do
     not specify a value the default is `BITS_PER_WORD'.

 -- Macro: POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED
     A C expression whose value is greater than zero if pointers that
     need to be extended from being `POINTER_SIZE' bits wide to `Pmode'
     are to be zero-extended and zero if they are to be sign-extended.
     If the value is less then zero then there must be an "ptr_extend"
     instruction that extends a pointer from `POINTER_SIZE' to `Pmode'.

     You need not define this macro if the `POINTER_SIZE' is equal to
     the width of `Pmode'.

 -- Macro: PROMOTE_MODE (M, UNSIGNEDP, TYPE)
     A macro to update M and UNSIGNEDP when an object whose type is
     TYPE and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be
     stored in a register.  This macro is only called when TYPE is a
     scalar type.

     On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on
     a full register, define this macro to set M to `word_mode' if M is
     an integer mode narrower than `BITS_PER_WORD'.  In most cases,
     only integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
     floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their
     narrower counterparts.

     For most machines, the macro definition does not change UNSIGNEDP.
     However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially
     handle either signed or unsigned quantities of certain modes.  For
     example, on the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add
     instructions sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines,
     set UNSIGNEDP according to which kind of extension is more
     efficient.

     Do not define this macro if it would never modify M.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS (tree FNTYPE)
     This target hook should return `true' if the promotion described by
     `PROMOTE_MODE' should also be done for outgoing function arguments.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN (tree FNTYPE)
     This target hook should return `true' if the promotion described by
     `PROMOTE_MODE' should also be done for the return value of
     functions.

     If this target hook returns `true', `FUNCTION_VALUE' must perform
     the same promotions done by `PROMOTE_MODE'.

 -- Macro: PROMOTE_FOR_CALL_ONLY
     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
     should _only_ be performed for outgoing function arguments or
     function return values, as specified by
     `TARGET_PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS' and
     `TARGET_PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN', respectively.

 -- Macro: PARM_BOUNDARY
     Normal alignment required for function parameters on the stack, in
     bits.  All stack parameters receive at least this much alignment
     regardless of data type.  On most machines, this is the same as the
     size of an integer.

 -- Macro: STACK_BOUNDARY
     Define this macro to the minimum alignment enforced by hardware
     for the stack pointer on this machine.  The definition is a C
     expression for the desired alignment (measured in bits).  This
     value is used as a default if `PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY' is not
     defined.  On most machines, this should be the same as
     `PARM_BOUNDARY'.

 -- Macro: PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY
     Define this macro if you wish to preserve a certain alignment for
     the stack pointer, greater than what the hardware enforces.  The
     definition is a C expression for the desired alignment (measured
     in bits).  This macro must evaluate to a value equal to or larger
     than `STACK_BOUNDARY'.

 -- Macro: FORCE_PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY_IN_MAIN
     A C expression that evaluates true if `PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY' is
     not guaranteed by the runtime and we should emit code to align the
     stack at the beginning of `main'.

     If `PUSH_ROUNDING' is not defined, the stack will always be aligned
     to the specified boundary.  If `PUSH_ROUNDING' is defined and
     specifies a less strict alignment than `PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY',
     the stack may be momentarily unaligned while pushing arguments.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_BOUNDARY
     Alignment required for a function entry point, in bits.

 -- Macro: BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT
     Biggest alignment that any data type can require on this machine,
     in bits.

 -- Macro: MINIMUM_ATOMIC_ALIGNMENT
     If defined, the smallest alignment, in bits, that can be given to
     an object that can be referenced in one operation, without
     disturbing any nearby object.  Normally, this is `BITS_PER_UNIT',
     but may be larger on machines that don't have byte or half-word
     store operations.

 -- Macro: BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT
     Biggest alignment that any structure or union field can require on
     this machine, in bits.  If defined, this overrides
     `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT' for structure and union fields only, unless
     the field alignment has been set by the `__attribute__ ((aligned
     (N)))' construct.

 -- Macro: ADJUST_FIELD_ALIGN (FIELD, COMPUTED)
     An expression for the alignment of a structure field FIELD if the
     alignment computed in the usual way (including applying of
     `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT' and `BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT' to the
     alignment) is COMPUTED.  It overrides alignment only if the field
     alignment has not been set by the `__attribute__ ((aligned (N)))'
     construct.

 -- Macro: MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT
     Biggest alignment supported by the object file format of this
     machine.  Use this macro to limit the alignment which can be
     specified using the `__attribute__ ((aligned (N)))' construct.  If
     not defined, the default value is `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.

 -- Macro: DATA_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a variable
     in the static store.  TYPE is the data type, and BASIC-ALIGN is
     the alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of
     this macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.  Another is to cause
     character arrays to be word-aligned so that `strcpy' calls that
     copy constants to character arrays can be done inline.

 -- Macro: CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT (CONSTANT, BASIC-ALIGN)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment given to a
     constant that is being placed in memory.  CONSTANT is the constant
     and BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to
     align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     The typical use of this macro is to increase alignment for string
     constants to be word aligned so that `strcpy' calls that copy
     constants can be done inline.

 -- Macro: LOCAL_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a variable
     in the local store.  TYPE is the data type, and BASIC-ALIGN is the
     alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this
     macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.

 -- Macro: EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY
     Alignment in bits to be given to a structure bit-field that
     follows an empty field such as `int : 0;'.

     If `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' is true, it overrides this macro.

 -- Macro: STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY
     Number of bits which any structure or union's size must be a
     multiple of.  Each structure or union's size is rounded up to a
     multiple of this.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is the same as
     `BITS_PER_UNIT'.

 -- Macro: STRICT_ALIGNMENT
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if instructions will fail to
     work if given data not on the nominal alignment.  If instructions
     will merely go slower in that case, define this macro as 0.

 -- Macro: PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS
     Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers
     handle alignment of bit-fields and the structures that contain
     them.

     The behavior is that the type written for a named bit-field (`int',
     `short', or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the entire
     structure, as if the structure really did contain an ordinary
     field of that type.  In addition, the bit-field is placed within
     the structure so that it would fit within such a field, not
     crossing a boundary for it.

     Thus, on most machines, a named bit-field whose type is written as
     `int' would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force
     four-byte alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used
     may not be four bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment
     parameters.)

     An unnamed bit-field will not affect the alignment of the
     containing structure.

     If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
     a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

     Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
     bit-fields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The
     compiler can support such references if there are `insv', `extv',
     and `extzv' insns that can directly reference memory.

     The other known way of making bit-fields work is to define
     `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' as large as `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.  Then
     every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

     Unless the machine has bit-field instructions or you define
     `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' that way, you must define
     `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' to have a nonzero value.

     If your aim is to make GCC use the same conventions for laying out
     bit-fields as are used by another compiler, here is how to
     investigate what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this
     program:

          struct foo1
          {
            char x;
            char :0;
            char y;
          };

          struct foo2
          {
            char x;
            int :0;
            char y;
          };

          main ()
          {
            printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo1));
            printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo2));
            exit (0);
          }

     If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you
     would get from `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'.

 -- Macro: BITFIELD_NBYTES_LIMITED
     Like `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' except that its effect is limited
     to aligning a bit-field within the structure.

 -- Macro: MEMBER_TYPE_FORCES_BLK (FIELD, MODE)
     Return 1 if a structure or array containing FIELD should be
     accessed using `BLKMODE'.

     If FIELD is the only field in the structure, MODE is its mode,
     otherwise MODE is VOIDmode.  MODE is provided in the case where
     structures of one field would require the structure's mode to
     retain the field's mode.

     Normally, this is not needed.  See the file `c4x.h' for an example
     of how to use this macro to prevent a structure having a floating
     point field from being accessed in an integer mode.

 -- Macro: ROUND_TYPE_ALIGN (TYPE, COMPUTED, SPECIFIED)
     Define this macro as an expression for the alignment of a type
     (given by TYPE as a tree node) if the alignment computed in the
     usual way is COMPUTED and the alignment explicitly specified was
     SPECIFIED.

     The default is to use SPECIFIED if it is larger; otherwise, use
     the smaller of COMPUTED and `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'

 -- Macro: MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE
     An integer expression for the size in bits of the largest integer
     machine mode that should actually be used.  All integer machine
     modes of this size or smaller can be used for structures and
     unions with the appropriate sizes.  If this macro is undefined,
     `GET_MODE_BITSIZE (DImode)' is assumed.

 -- Macro: VECTOR_MODE_SUPPORTED_P (MODE)
     Define this macro to be nonzero if the port is prepared to handle
     insns involving vector mode MODE.  At the very least, it must have
     move patterns for this mode.

 -- Macro: STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE (SAVE_LEVEL)
     If defined, an expression of type `enum machine_mode' that
     specifies the mode of the save area operand of a
     `save_stack_LEVEL' named pattern (*note Standard Names::).
     SAVE_LEVEL is one of `SAVE_BLOCK', `SAVE_FUNCTION', or
     `SAVE_NONLOCAL' and selects which of the three named patterns is
     having its mode specified.

     You need not define this macro if it always returns `Pmode'.  You
     would most commonly define this macro if the `save_stack_LEVEL'
     patterns need to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.

 -- Macro: STACK_SIZE_MODE
     If defined, an expression of type `enum machine_mode' that
     specifies the mode of the size increment operand of an
     `allocate_stack' named pattern (*note Standard Names::).

     You need not define this macro if it always returns `word_mode'.
     You would most commonly define this macro if the `allocate_stack'
     pattern needs to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.

 -- Macro: TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT
     A code distinguishing the floating point format of the target
     machine.  There are four defined values:

    `IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates IEEE floating point.  It is the default;
          there is no need to define `TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT' when the
          format is IEEE.

    `VAX_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates the "F float" (for `float') and "D float"
          or "G float" formats (for `double') used on the VAX and
          PDP-11.

    `IBM_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates the format used on the IBM System/370.

    `C4X_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates the format used on the TMS320C3x/C4x.

     If your target uses a floating point format other than these, you
     must define a new NAME_FLOAT_FORMAT code for it, and add support
     for it to `real.c'.

     The ordering of the component words of floating point values
     stored in memory is controlled by `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.

 -- Macro: MODE_HAS_NANS (MODE)
     When defined, this macro should be true if MODE has a NaN
     representation.  The compiler assumes that NaNs are not equal to
     anything (including themselves) and that addition, subtraction,
     multiplication and division all return NaNs when one operand is
     NaN.

     By default, this macro is true if MODE is a floating-point mode
     and the target floating-point format is IEEE.

 -- Macro: MODE_HAS_INFINITIES (MODE)
     This macro should be true if MODE can represent infinity.  At
     present, the compiler uses this macro to decide whether `x - x' is
     always defined.  By default, the macro is true when MODE is a
     floating-point mode and the target format is IEEE.

 -- Macro: MODE_HAS_SIGNED_ZEROS (MODE)
     True if MODE distinguishes between positive and negative zero.
     The rules are expected to follow the IEEE standard:

        * `x + x' has the same sign as `x'.

        * If the sum of two values with opposite sign is zero, the
          result is positive for all rounding modes expect towards
          -infinity, for which it is negative.

        * The sign of a product or quotient is negative when exactly one
          of the operands is negative.

     The default definition is true if MODE is a floating-point mode
     and the target format is IEEE.

 -- Macro: MODE_HAS_SIGN_DEPENDENT_ROUNDING (MODE)
     If defined, this macro should be true for MODE if it has at least
     one rounding mode in which `x' and `-x' can be rounded to numbers
     of different magnitude.  Two such modes are towards -infinity and
     towards +infinity.

     The default definition of this macro is true if MODE is a
     floating-point mode and the target format is IEEE.

 -- Macro: ROUND_TOWARDS_ZERO
     If defined, this macro should be true if the prevailing rounding
     mode is towards zero.  A true value has the following effects:

        * `MODE_HAS_SIGN_DEPENDENT_ROUNDING' will be false for all
          modes.

        * `libgcc.a''s floating-point emulator will round towards zero
          rather than towards nearest.

        * The compiler's floating-point emulator will round towards
          zero after doing arithmetic, and when converting from the
          internal float format to the target format.

     The macro does not affect the parsing of string literals.  When the
     primary rounding mode is towards zero, library functions like
     `strtod' might still round towards nearest, and the compiler's
     parser should behave like the target's `strtod' where possible.

     Not defining this macro is equivalent to returning zero.

 -- Macro: LARGEST_EXPONENT_IS_NORMAL (SIZE)
     This macro should return true if floats with SIZE bits do not have
     a NaN or infinity representation, but use the largest exponent for
     normal numbers instead.

     Defining this macro to true for SIZE causes `MODE_HAS_NANS' and
     `MODE_HAS_INFINITIES' to be false for SIZE-bit modes.  It also
     affects the way `libgcc.a' and `real.c' emulate floating-point
     arithmetic.

     The default definition of this macro returns false for all sizes.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_VECTOR_OPAQUE_P (tree TYPE)
     This target hook should return `true' a vector is opaque.  That
     is, if no cast is needed when copying a vector value of type TYPE
     into another vector lvalue of the same size.  Vector opaque types
     cannot be initialized.  The default is that there are no such
     types.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_MS_BITFIELD_LAYOUT_P (tree RECORD_TYPE)
     This target hook returns `true' if bit-fields in the given
     RECORD_TYPE are to be laid out following the rules of Microsoft
     Visual C/C++, namely: (i) a bit-field won't share the same storage
     unit with the previous bit-field if their underlying types have
     different sizes, and the bit-field will be aligned to the highest
     alignment of the underlying types of itself and of the previous
     bit-field; (ii) a zero-sized bit-field will affect the alignment of
     the whole enclosing structure, even if it is unnamed; except that
     (iii) a zero-sized bit-field will be disregarded unless it follows
     another bit-field of nonzero size.  If this hook returns `true',
     other macros that control bit-field layout are ignored.

     When a bit-field is inserted into a packed record, the whole size
     of the underlying type is used by one or more same-size adjacent
     bit-fields (that is, if its long:3, 32 bits is used in the record,
     and any additional adjacent long bit-fields are packed into the
     same chunk of 32 bits. However, if the size changes, a new field
     of that size is allocated). In an unpacked record, this is the
     same as using alignment, but not equivalent when packing.

     If both MS bit-fields and `__attribute__((packed))' are used, the
     latter will take precedence. If `__attribute__((packed))' is used
     on a single field when MS bit-fields are in use, it will take
     precedence for that field, but the alignment of the rest of the
     structure may affect its placement.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_MANGLE_FUNDAMENTAL_TYPE (tree TYPE)
     If your target defines any fundamental types, define this hook to
     return the appropriate encoding for these types as part of a C++
     mangled name.  The TYPE argument is the tree structure
     representing the type to be mangled.  The hook may be applied to
     trees which are not target-specific fundamental types; it should
     return `NULL' for all such types, as well as arguments it does not
     recognize.  If the return value is not `NULL', it must point to a
     statically-allocated string constant.

     Target-specific fundamental types might be new fundamental types or
     qualified versions of ordinary fundamental types.  Encode new
     fundamental types as `u N NAME', where NAME is the name used for
     the type in source code, and N is the length of NAME in decimal.
     Encode qualified versions of ordinary types as `U N NAME CODE',
     where NAME is the name used for the type qualifier in source code,
     N is the length of NAME as above, and CODE is the code used to
     represent the unqualified version of this type.  (See
     `write_builtin_type' in `cp/mangle.c' for the list of codes.)  In
     both cases the spaces are for clarity; do not include any spaces
     in your string.

     The default version of this hook always returns `NULL', which is
     appropriate for a target that does not define any new fundamental
     types.

11.6 Layout of Source Language Data Types
=========================================

These macros define the sizes and other characteristics of the standard
basic data types used in programs being compiled.  Unlike the macros in
the previous section, these apply to specific features of C and related
languages, rather than to fundamental aspects of storage layout.

 -- Macro: INT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `int' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

 -- Macro: SHORT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `short' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is half a
     word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded
     up to one unit.)

 -- Macro: LONG_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

 -- Macro: ADA_LONG_TYPE_SIZE
     On some machines, the size used for the Ada equivalent of the type
     `long' by a native Ada compiler differs from that used by C.  In
     that situation, define this macro to be a C expression to be used
     for the size of that type.  If you don't define this, the default
     is the value of `LONG_TYPE_SIZE'.

 -- Macro: MAX_LONG_TYPE_SIZE
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `long' on the
     target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `LONG_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `LONG_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
     used in `cpp'.

 -- Macro: LONG_LONG_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long long' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.  If you want to support GNU Ada on your machine, the value
     of this macro must be at least 64.

 -- Macro: CHAR_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `char' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     `BITS_PER_UNIT'.

 -- Macro: BOOL_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the C++ type `bool' and C99
     type `_Bool' on the target machine.  If you don't define this, and
     you probably shouldn't, the default is `CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.

 -- Macro: FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `float' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

 -- Macro: DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `double' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

 -- Macro: LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long double' on
     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

 -- Macro: MAX_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `long double' on
     the target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that
     is the largest value that `LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' can have at
     run-time.  This is used in `cpp'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_FLT_EVAL_METHOD
     A C expression for the value for `FLT_EVAL_METHOD' in `float.h',
     assuming, if applicable, that the floating-point control word is
     in its default state.  If you do not define this macro the value of
     `FLT_EVAL_METHOD' will be zero.

 -- Macro: WIDEST_HARDWARE_FP_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the widest floating-point
     format supported by the hardware.  If you define this macro, you
     must specify a value less than or equal to the value of
     `LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  If you do not define this macro, the
     value of `LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is the default.

 -- Macro: DEFAULT_SIGNED_CHAR
     An expression whose value is 1 or 0, according to whether the type
     `char' should be signed or unsigned by default.  The user can
     always override this default with the options `-fsigned-char' and
     `-funsigned-char'.

 -- Macro: DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS
     A C expression to determine whether to give an `enum' type only as
     many bytes as it takes to represent the range of possible values
     of that type.  A nonzero value means to do that; a zero value
     means all `enum' types should be allocated like `int'.

     If you don't define the macro, the default is 0.

 -- Macro: SIZE_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for size values.  The typedef name `size_t' is defined
     using the contents of the string.

     The string can contain more than one keyword.  If so, separate
     them with spaces, and write first any length keyword, then
     `unsigned' if appropriate, and finally `int'.  The string must
     exactly match one of the data type names defined in the function
     `init_decl_processing' in the file `c-decl.c'.  You may not omit
     `int' or change the order--that would cause the compiler to crash
     on startup.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"long unsigned
     int"'.

 -- Macro: PTRDIFF_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for the result of subtracting two pointers.  The typedef
     name `ptrdiff_t' is defined using the contents of the string.  See
     `SIZE_TYPE' above for more information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"long int"'.

 -- Macro: WCHAR_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for wide characters.  The typedef name `wchar_t' is defined
     using the contents of the string.  See `SIZE_TYPE' above for more
     information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"int"'.

 -- Macro: WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the data type for wide
     characters.  This is used in `cpp', which cannot make use of
     `WCHAR_TYPE'.

 -- Macro: MAX_WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the data type for wide
     characters.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
     used in `cpp'.

 -- Macro: GCOV_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type used for gcov
     counters on the target machine.  If you don't define this, the
     default is one `LONG_TYPE_SIZE' in case it is greater or equal to
     64-bit and `LONG_LONG_TYPE_SIZE' otherwise.  You may want to
     re-define the type to ensure atomicity for counters in
     multithreaded programs.

 -- Macro: WINT_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to
     use for wide characters passed to `printf' and returned from
     `getwc'.  The typedef name `wint_t' is defined using the contents
     of the string.  See `SIZE_TYPE' above for more information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"unsigned int"'.

 -- Macro: INTMAX_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     that can represent any value of any standard or extended signed
     integer type.  The typedef name `intmax_t' is defined using the
     contents of the string.  See `SIZE_TYPE' above for more
     information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is the first of
     `"int"', `"long int"', or `"long long int"' that has as much
     precision as `long long int'.

 -- Macro: UINTMAX_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     that can represent any value of any standard or extended unsigned
     integer type.  The typedef name `uintmax_t' is defined using the
     contents of the string.  See `SIZE_TYPE' above for more
     information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is the first of
     `"unsigned int"', `"long unsigned int"', or `"long long unsigned
     int"' that has as much precision as `long long unsigned int'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_PTRMEMFUNC_VBIT_LOCATION
     The C++ compiler represents a pointer-to-member-function with a
     struct that looks like:

            struct {
              union {
                void (*fn)();
                ptrdiff_t vtable_index;
              };
              ptrdiff_t delta;
            };

     The C++ compiler must use one bit to indicate whether the function
     that will be called through a pointer-to-member-function is
     virtual.  Normally, we assume that the low-order bit of a function
     pointer must always be zero.  Then, by ensuring that the
     vtable_index is odd, we can distinguish which variant of the union
     is in use.  But, on some platforms function pointers can be odd,
     and so this doesn't work.  In that case, we use the low-order bit
     of the `delta' field, and shift the remainder of the `delta' field
     to the left.

     GCC will automatically make the right selection about where to
     store this bit using the `FUNCTION_BOUNDARY' setting for your
     platform.  However, some platforms such as ARM/Thumb have
     `FUNCTION_BOUNDARY' set such that functions always start at even
     addresses, but the lowest bit of pointers to functions indicate
     whether the function at that address is in ARM or Thumb mode.  If
     this is the case of your architecture, you should define this
     macro to `ptrmemfunc_vbit_in_delta'.

     In general, you should not have to define this macro.  On
     architectures in which function addresses are always even,
     according to `FUNCTION_BOUNDARY', GCC will automatically define
     this macro to `ptrmemfunc_vbit_in_pfn'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_VTABLE_USES_DESCRIPTORS
     Normally, the C++ compiler uses function pointers in vtables.  This
     macro allows the target to change to use "function descriptors"
     instead.  Function descriptors are found on targets for whom a
     function pointer is actually a small data structure.  Normally the
     data structure consists of the actual code address plus a data
     pointer to which the function's data is relative.

     If vtables are used, the value of this macro should be the number
     of words that the function descriptor occupies.

 -- Macro: TARGET_VTABLE_ENTRY_ALIGN
     By default, the vtable entries are void pointers, the so the
     alignment is the same as pointer alignment.  The value of this
     macro specifies the alignment of the vtable entry in bits.  It
     should be defined only when special alignment is necessary. */

 -- Macro: TARGET_VTABLE_DATA_ENTRY_DISTANCE
     There are a few non-descriptor entries in the vtable at offsets
     below zero.  If these entries must be padded (say, to preserve the
     alignment specified by `TARGET_VTABLE_ENTRY_ALIGN'), set this to
     the number of words in each data entry.

11.7 Target Character Escape Sequences
======================================

By default, GCC assumes that the C character escape sequences take on
their ASCII values for the target.  If this is not correct, you must
explicitly define all of the macros below.  All of them must evaluate
to constants; they are used in `case' statements.

Macro              Escape   ASCII character
`TARGET_BELL'      `\a'     `07', `BEL'
`TARGET_CR'        `\r'     `0D', `CR'
`TARGET_ESC'       `\e',    `1B', `ESC'
                   `\E'     
`TARGET_FF'        `\f'     `0C', `FF'
`TARGET_NEWLINE'   `\n'     `0A', `LF'
`TARGET_TAB'       `\t'     `09', `HT'
`TARGET_VT'        `\v'     `0B', `VT'

Note that the `\e' and `\E' escapes are GNU extensions, not part of the
C standard.

11.8.1 Basic Characteristics of Registers
-----------------------------------------

Registers have various characteristics.

 -- Macro: FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER
     Number of hardware registers known to the compiler.  They receive
     numbers 0 through `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER-1'; thus, the first
     pseudo register's number really is assigned the number
     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'.

 -- Macro: FIXED_REGISTERS
     An initializer that says which registers are used for fixed
     purposes all throughout the compiled code and are therefore not
     available for general allocation.  These would include the stack
     pointer, the frame pointer (except on machines where that can be
     used as a general register when no frame pointer is needed), the
     program counter on machines where that is considered one of the
     addressable registers, and any other numbered register with a
     standard use.

     This information is expressed as a sequence of numbers, separated
     by commas and surrounded by braces.  The Nth number is 1 if
     register N is fixed, 0 otherwise.

     The table initialized from this macro, and the table initialized by
     the following one, may be overridden at run time either
     automatically, by the actions of the macro
     `CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE', or by the user with the command
     options `-ffixed-REG', `-fcall-used-REG' and `-fcall-saved-REG'.

 -- Macro: CALL_USED_REGISTERS
     Like `FIXED_REGISTERS' but has 1 for each register that is
     clobbered (in general) by function calls as well as for fixed
     registers.  This macro therefore identifies the registers that are
     not available for general allocation of values that must live
     across function calls.

     If a register has 0 in `CALL_USED_REGISTERS', the compiler
     automatically saves it on function entry and restores it on
     function exit, if the register is used within the function.

 -- Macro: CALL_REALLY_USED_REGISTERS
     Like `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' except this macro doesn't require that
     the entire set of `FIXED_REGISTERS' be included.
     (`CALL_USED_REGISTERS' must be a superset of `FIXED_REGISTERS').
     This macro is optional.  If not specified, it defaults to the value
     of `CALL_USED_REGISTERS'.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_CALL_PART_CLOBBERED (REGNO, MODE)
     A C expression that is nonzero if it is not permissible to store a
     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO across a call
     without some part of it being clobbered.  For most machines this
     macro need not be defined.  It is only required for machines that
     do not preserve the entire contents of a register across a call.

 -- Macro: CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE
     Zero or more C statements that may conditionally modify five
     variables `fixed_regs', `call_used_regs', `global_regs',
     `reg_names', and `reg_class_contents', to take into account any
     dependence of these register sets on target flags.  The first three
     of these are of type `char []' (interpreted as Boolean vectors).
     `global_regs' is a `const char *[]', and `reg_class_contents' is a
     `HARD_REG_SET'.  Before the macro is called, `fixed_regs',
     `call_used_regs', `reg_class_contents', and `reg_names' have been
     initialized from `FIXED_REGISTERS', `CALL_USED_REGISTERS',
     `REG_CLASS_CONTENTS', and `REGISTER_NAMES', respectively.
     `global_regs' has been cleared, and any `-ffixed-REG',
     `-fcall-used-REG' and `-fcall-saved-REG' command options have been
     applied.

     You need not define this macro if it has no work to do.

     If the usage of an entire class of registers depends on the target
     flags, you may indicate this to GCC by using this macro to modify
     `fixed_regs' and `call_used_regs' to 1 for each of the registers
     in the classes which should not be used by GCC.  Also define the
     macro `REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER' / `REG_CLASS_FROM_CONSTRAINT' to
     return `NO_REGS' if it is called with a letter for a class that
     shouldn't be used.

     (However, if this class is not included in `GENERAL_REGS' and all
     of the insn patterns whose constraints permit this class are
     controlled by target switches, then GCC will automatically avoid
     using these registers when the target switches are opposed to
     them.)

 -- Macro: NON_SAVING_SETJMP
     If this macro is defined and has a nonzero value, it means that
     `setjmp' and related functions fail to save the registers, or that
     `longjmp' fails to restore them.  To compensate, the compiler
     avoids putting variables in registers in functions that use
     `setjmp'.

 -- Macro: INCOMING_REGNO (OUT)
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
     This C expression returns the register number as seen by the
     called function corresponding to the register number OUT as seen
     by the calling function.  Return OUT if register number OUT is not
     an outbound register.

 -- Macro: OUTGOING_REGNO (IN)
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
     This C expression returns the register number as seen by the
     calling function corresponding to the register number IN as seen
     by the called function.  Return IN if register number IN is not an
     inbound register.

 -- Macro: LOCAL_REGNO (REGNO)
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
     This C expression returns true if the register is call-saved but
     is in the register window.  Unlike most call-saved registers, such
     registers need not be explicitly restored on function exit or
     during non-local gotos.

 -- Macro: PC_REGNUM
     If the program counter has a register number, define this as that
     register number.  Otherwise, do not define it.

11.8.2 Order of Allocation of Registers
---------------------------------------

Registers are allocated in order.

 -- Macro: REG_ALLOC_ORDER
     If defined, an initializer for a vector of integers, containing the
     numbers of hard registers in the order in which GCC should prefer
     to use them (from most preferred to least).

     If this macro is not defined, registers are used lowest numbered
     first (all else being equal).

     One use of this macro is on machines where the highest numbered
     registers must always be saved and the save-multiple-registers
     instruction supports only sequences of consecutive registers.  On
     such machines, define `REG_ALLOC_ORDER' to be an initializer that
     lists the highest numbered allocable register first.

 -- Macro: ORDER_REGS_FOR_LOCAL_ALLOC
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to choose the order in which to
     allocate hard registers for pseudo-registers local to a basic
     block.

     Store the desired register order in the array `reg_alloc_order'.
     Element 0 should be the register to allocate first; element 1, the
     next register; and so on.

     The macro body should not assume anything about the contents of
     `reg_alloc_order' before execution of the macro.

     On most machines, it is not necessary to define this macro.

11.8.3 How Values Fit in Registers
----------------------------------

This section discusses the macros that describe which kinds of values
(specifically, which machine modes) each register can hold, and how many
consecutive registers are needed for a given mode.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)
     A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers,
     starting at register number REGNO, required to hold a value of mode
     MODE.

     On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
     definition of this macro is

          #define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
             ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
              / UNITS_PER_WORD)

 -- Macro: REGMODE_NATURAL_SIZE (MODE)
     Define this macro if the natural size of registers that hold values
     of mode MODE is not the word size.  It is a C expression that
     should give the natural size in bytes for the specified mode.  It
     is used by the register allocator to try to optimize its results.
     This happens for example on SPARC 64-bit where the natural size of
     floating-point registers is still 32-bit.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (REGNO, MODE)
     A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a
     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO (or in several
     registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all
     registers are equivalent, a suitable definition is

          #define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1

     You need not include code to check for the numbers of fixed
     registers, because the allocation mechanism considers them to be
     always occupied.

     On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
     register pairs.  You can implement that by defining this macro to
     reject odd register numbers for such modes.

     The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that
     the `movMODE' instruction pattern support moves between the
     register and other hard register in the same class and that moving
     a value into the register and back out not alter it.

     Since the same instruction used to move `word_mode' will work for
     all narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' to distinguish between these modes, provided
     you define patterns `movhi', etc., to take advantage of this.  This
     is useful because of the interaction between `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
     and `MODES_TIEABLE_P'; it is very desirable for all integer modes
     to be tieable.

     Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
     Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed
     only in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any
     registers that can hold integers can safely _hold_ a floating
     point machine mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done
     on it in those registers.  Integer move instructions can be used
     to move the values.

     On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
     modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the
     floating registers normalize any value stored in them, because
     storing a non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' should reject fixed-point machine modes in
     floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not
     automatically normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one
     and retrieve it unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode
     may go in a floating register, so you can define this macro to say
     so.

     The primary significance of special floating registers is rather
     that they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
     instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.  You handle it by writing the proper
     constraints for those instructions.

     On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to
     access, so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame
     than in such a register if floating point arithmetic is not being
     done.  As long as the floating registers are not in class
     `GENERAL_REGS', they will not be used unless some pattern's
     constraint asks for one.

 -- Macro: MODES_TIEABLE_P (MODE1, MODE2)
     A C expression that is nonzero if a value of mode MODE1 is
     accessible in mode MODE2 without copying.

     If `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R, MODE1)' and `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R,
     MODE2)' are always the same for any R, then `MODES_TIEABLE_P
     (MODE1, MODE2)' should be nonzero.  If they differ for any R, you
     should define this macro to return zero unless some other
     mechanism ensures the accessibility of the value in a narrower
     mode.

     You should define this macro to return nonzero in as many cases as
     possible since doing so will allow GCC to perform better register
     allocation.

 -- Macro: AVOID_CCMODE_COPIES
     Define this macro if the compiler should avoid copies to/from
     `CCmode' registers.  You should only define this macro if support
     for copying to/from `CCmode' is incomplete.

11.8.4 Handling Leaf Functions
------------------------------

On some machines, a leaf function (i.e., one which makes no calls) can
run more efficiently if it does not make its own register window.
Often this means it is required to receive its arguments in the
registers where they are passed by the caller, instead of the registers
where they would normally arrive.

   The special treatment for leaf functions generally applies only when
other conditions are met; for example, often they may use only those
registers for its own variables and temporaries.  We use the term "leaf
function" to mean a function that is suitable for this special
handling, so that functions with no calls are not necessarily "leaf
functions".

   GCC assigns register numbers before it knows whether the function is
suitable for leaf function treatment.  So it needs to renumber the
registers in order to output a leaf function.  The following macros
accomplish this.

 -- Macro: LEAF_REGISTERS
     Name of a char vector, indexed by hard register number, which
     contains 1 for a register that is allowable in a candidate for leaf
     function treatment.

     If leaf function treatment involves renumbering the registers,
     then the registers marked here should be the ones before
     renumbering--those that GCC would ordinarily allocate.  The
     registers which will actually be used in the assembler code, after
     renumbering, should not be marked with 1 in this vector.

     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
     optimize the treatment of leaf functions.

 -- Macro: LEAF_REG_REMAP (REGNO)
     A C expression whose value is the register number to which REGNO
     should be renumbered, when a function is treated as a leaf
     function.

     If REGNO is a register number which should not appear in a leaf
     function before renumbering, then the expression should yield -1,
     which will cause the compiler to abort.

     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
     optimize the treatment of leaf functions, and registers need to be
     renumbered to do this.

   `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'
must usually treat leaf functions specially.  They can test the C
variable `current_function_is_leaf' which is nonzero for leaf
functions.  `current_function_is_leaf' is set prior to local register
allocation and is valid for the remaining compiler passes.  They can
also test the C variable `current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs' which
is nonzero for leaf functions which only use leaf registers.
`current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs' is valid after reload and is
only useful if `LEAF_REGISTERS' is defined.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Stack Registers,  Prev: Leaf Functions,  Up: Registers

11.8.5 Registers That Form a Stack
----------------------------------

There are special features to handle computers where some of the
"registers" form a stack.  Stack registers are normally written by
pushing onto the stack, and are numbered relative to the top of the
stack.

   Currently, GCC can only handle one group of stack-like registers, and
they must be consecutively numbered.  Furthermore, the existing support
for stack-like registers is specific to the 80387 floating point
coprocessor.  If you have a new architecture that uses stack-like
registers, you will need to do substantial work on `reg-stack.c' and
write your machine description to cooperate with it, as well as
defining these macros.

 -- Macro: STACK_REGS
     Define this if the machine has any stack-like registers.

 -- Macro: FIRST_STACK_REG
     The number of the first stack-like register.  This one is the top
     of the stack.

 -- Macro: LAST_STACK_REG
     The number of the last stack-like register.  This one is the
     bottom of the stack.

11.9 Register Classes
=====================

On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent.  For
example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed addressing;
certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.  These
machine restrictions are described to the compiler using "register
classes".

   You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and
saying which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify
register classes that are allowed as operands to particular instruction
patterns.

   In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact,
one class must be named `ALL_REGS' and contain all the registers.
Another class must be named `NO_REGS' and contain no registers.  Often
the union of two classes will be another class; however, this is not
required.

   One of the classes must be named `GENERAL_REGS'.  There is nothing
terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters `r'
and `g' specify this class.  If `GENERAL_REGS' is the same as
`ALL_REGS', just define it as a macro which expands to `ALL_REGS'.

   Order the classes so that if class X is contained in class Y then X
has a lower class number than Y.

   The way classes other than `GENERAL_REGS' are specified in operand
constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters.
You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
them in operand constraints.

   You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register
for a certain operand, you should define a class `FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS'
which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code.

   You must also specify certain redundant information about the
register classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which
ones are contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class
contained in their union.

   When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class.
Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
specify this requirement is with `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.

   Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer
that mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the
operations for single-byte values (`QImode') are limited to certain
registers.  When this is so, each register class that is used in a
bitwise-and or shift instruction must have a subclass consisting of
registers from which single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This
is so that `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' can always have a possible value to
return.

 -- Data type: enum reg_class
     An enumerated type that must be defined with all the register
     class names as enumerated values.  `NO_REGS' must be first.
     `ALL_REGS' must be the last register class, followed by one more
     enumerated value, `LIM_REG_CLASSES', which is not a register class
     but rather tells how many classes there are.

     Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting
     the class name to type `int'.  The number serves as an index in
     many of the tables described below.

 -- Macro: N_REG_CLASSES
     The number of distinct register classes, defined as follows:

          #define N_REG_CLASSES (int) LIM_REG_CLASSES

 -- Macro: REG_CLASS_NAMES
     An initializer containing the names of the register classes as C
     string constants.  These names are used in writing some of the
     debugging dumps.

 -- Macro: REG_CLASS_CONTENTS
     An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as
     integers which are bit masks.  The Nth integer specifies the
     contents of class N.  The way the integer MASK is interpreted is
     that register R is in the class if `MASK & (1 << R)' is 1.

     When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not
     suffice.  Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers,
     braced groupings containing several integers.  Each
     sub-initializer must be suitable as an initializer for the type
     `HARD_REG_SET' which is defined in `hard-reg-set.h'.  In this
     situation, the first integer in each sub-initializer corresponds to
     registers 0 through 31, the second integer to registers 32 through
     63, and so on.

 -- Macro: REGNO_REG_CLASS (REGNO)
     A C expression whose value is a register class containing hard
     register REGNO.  In general there is more than one such class;
     choose a class which is "minimal", meaning that no smaller class
     also contains the register.

 -- Macro: BASE_REG_CLASS
     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
     base register must belong.  A base register is one used in an
     address which is the register value plus a displacement.

 -- Macro: MODE_BASE_REG_CLASS (MODE)
     This is a variation of the `BASE_REG_CLASS' macro which allows the
     selection of a base register in a mode dependent manner.  If MODE
     is VOIDmode then it should return the same value as
     `BASE_REG_CLASS'.

 -- Macro: INDEX_REG_CLASS
     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
     index register must belong.  An index register is one used in an
     address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
     added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).

 -- Macro: CONSTRAINT_LEN (CHAR, STR)
     For the constraint at the start of STR, which starts with the
     letter C, return the length.  This allows you to have register
     class / constant / extra constraints that are longer than a single
     letter; you don't need to define this macro if you can do with
     single-letter constraints only.  The definition of this macro
     should use DEFAULT_CONSTRAINT_LEN for all the characters that you
     don't want to handle specially.  There are some sanity checks in
     genoutput.c that check the constraint lengths for the md file, so
     you can also use this macro to help you while you are
     transitioning from a byzantine single-letter-constraint scheme:
     when you return a negative length for a constraint you want to
     re-use, genoutput will complain about every instance where it is
     used in the md file.

 -- Macro: REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER (CHAR)
     A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters for register classes.  If CHAR is such a
     letter, the value should be the register class corresponding to
     it.  Otherwise, the value should be `NO_REGS'.  The register
     letter `r', corresponding to class `GENERAL_REGS', will not be
     passed to this macro; you do not need to handle it.

 -- Macro: REG_CLASS_FROM_CONSTRAINT (CHAR, STR)
     Like `REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER', but you also get the constraint
     string passed in STR, so that you can use suffixes to distinguish
     between different variants.

 -- Macro: REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM)
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as a base register in operand addresses.  It may be either
     a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
     allocated such a hard register.

 -- Macro: REGNO_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM, MODE)
     A C expression that is just like `REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P', except that
     that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
     MODE.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
     reference affects whether a register may be used as a base
     register.  If you define this macro, the compiler will use it
     instead of `REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P'.

 -- Macro: REGNO_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (NUM)
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
     either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
     allocated such a hard register.

     The difference between an index register and a base register is
     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
     both registers only if neither labeling works.

 -- Macro: PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)
     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to copy value X into a register
     in class CLASS.  The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or
     perhaps another, smaller class.  On many machines, the following
     definition is safe:

          #define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS

     Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.
     For example, on the 68000, when X is an integer constant that is
     in range for a `moveq' instruction, the value of this macro is
     always `DATA_REGS' as long as CLASS includes the data registers.
     Requiring a data register guarantees that a `moveq' will be used.

     One case where `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' must not return CLASS is
     if X is a legitimate constant which cannot be loaded into some
     register class.  By returning `NO_REGS' you can force X into a
     memory location.  For example, rs6000 can load immediate values
     into general-purpose registers, but does not have an instruction
     for loading an immediate value into a floating-point register, so
     `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' returns `NO_REGS' when X is a
     floating-point constant.  If the constant can't be loaded into any
     kind of register, code generation will be better if
     `LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P' makes the constant illegitimate instead of
     using `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS'.

 -- Macro: PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)
     Like `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', but for output reloads instead of
     input reloads.  If you don't define this macro, the default is to
     use CLASS, unchanged.

 -- Macro: LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS (MODE, CLASS)
     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of
     mode MODE in a reload register for which class CLASS would
     ordinarily be used.

     Unlike `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', this macro should be used when
     there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload
     classes.

     The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or perhaps another,
     smaller class.

     Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations
     which require the macro to do something nontrivial.

 -- Macro: SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)
 -- Macro: SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)
 -- Macro: SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)
     Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly
     to or from memory or even from other types of registers.  An
     example is the `MQ' register, which on most machines, can only be
     copied to or from general registers, but not memory.  Some
     machines allow copying all registers to and from memory, but
     require a scratch register for stores to some memory locations
     (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT, and those with
     certain symbolic address on the SPARC when compiling PIC).  In
     some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
     required.

     You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase
     that it may need to allocate at least one register for a reload in
     addition to the register to contain the data.  Specifically, if
     copying X to a register CLASS in MODE requires an intermediate
     register, you should define `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to
     return the largest register class all of whose registers can be
     used as intermediate registers or scratch registers.

     If copying a register CLASS in MODE to X requires an intermediate
     or scratch register, `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' should be
     defined to return the largest register class required.  If the
     requirements for input and output reloads are the same, the macro
     `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS' should be used instead of defining both
     macros identically.

     The values returned by these macros are often `GENERAL_REGS'.
     Return `NO_REGS' if no spare register is needed; i.e., if X can be
     directly copied to or from a register of CLASS in MODE without
     requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this macro if it
     would always return `NO_REGS'.

     If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
     intermediate register), you should define patterns for
     `reload_inM' or `reload_outM', as required (*note Standard
     Names::.  These patterns, which will normally be implemented with
     a `define_expand', should be similar to the `movM' patterns,
     except that operand 2 is the scratch register.

     Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register
     that contain a single register class.  If the original reload
     register (whose class is CLASS) can meet the constraint given in
     the pattern, the value returned by these macros is used for the
     class of the scratch register.  Otherwise, two additional reload
     registers are required.  Their classes are obtained from the
     constraints in the insn pattern.

     X might be a pseudo-register or a `subreg' of a pseudo-register,
     which could either be in a hard register or in memory.  Use
     `true_regnum' to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is in
     memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

     These macros should not be used in the case where a particular
     class of registers can only be copied to memory and not to another
     class of registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are
     not needed and would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location
     must be used to perform the copy and the `movM' pattern should use
     memory as an intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between
     floating-point and general registers.

 -- Macro: SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (CLASS1, CLASS2, M)
     Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be
     copied to some other registers without using memory.  Define this
     macro on those machines to be a C expression that is nonzero if
     objects of mode M in registers of CLASS1 can only be copied to
     registers of class CLASS2 by storing a register of CLASS1 into
     memory and loading that memory location into a register of CLASS2.

     Do not define this macro if its value would always be zero.

 -- Macro: SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_RTX (MODE)
     Normally when `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' is defined, the compiler
     allocates a stack slot for a memory location needed for register
     copies.  If this macro is defined, the compiler instead uses the
     memory location defined by this macro.

     Do not define this macro if you do not define
     `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED'.

 -- Macro: SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_MODE (MODE)
     When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy
     between two registers of mode MODE, it normally allocates
     sufficient memory to hold a quantity of `BITS_PER_WORD' bits and
     performs the store and load operations in a mode that many bits
     wide and whose class is the same as that of MODE.

     This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that
     all bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the
     registers in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for
     floating-point registers.

     However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines,
     such as the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point
     registers differently than in integer registers.  On those
     machines, the default widening will not work correctly and you
     must define this macro to suppress that widening in some cases.
     See the file `alpha.h' for details.

     Do not define this macro if you do not define
     `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' or if widening MODE to a mode that is
     `BITS_PER_WORD' bits wide is correct for your machine.

 -- Macro: SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES
     On some machines, it is risky to let hard registers live across
     arbitrary insns.  Typically, these machines have instructions that
     require values to be in specific registers (like an accumulator),
     and reload will fail if the required hard register is used for
     another purpose across such an insn.

     Define `SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES' to be an expression with a nonzero
     value on these machines.  When this macro has a nonzero value, the
     compiler will try to minimize the lifetime of hard registers.

     It is always safe to define this macro with a nonzero value, but
     if you unnecessarily define it, you will reduce the amount of
     optimizations that can be performed in some cases.  If you do not
     define this macro with a nonzero value when it is required, the
     compiler will run out of spill registers and print a fatal error
     message.  For most machines, you should not define this macro at
     all.

 -- Macro: CLASS_LIKELY_SPILLED_P (CLASS)
     A C expression whose value is nonzero if pseudos that have been
     assigned to registers of class CLASS would likely be spilled
     because registers of CLASS are needed for spill registers.

     The default value of this macro returns 1 if CLASS has exactly one
     register and zero otherwise.  On most machines, this default
     should be used.  Only define this macro to some other expression
     if pseudos allocated by `local-alloc.c' end up in memory because
     their hard registers were needed for spill registers.  If this
     macro returns nonzero for those classes, those pseudos will only
     be allocated by `global.c', which knows how to reallocate the
     pseudo to another register.  If there would not be another
     register available for reallocation, you should not change the
     definition of this macro since the only effect of such a
     definition would be to slow down register allocation.

 -- Macro: CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)
     A C expression for the maximum number of consecutive registers of
     class CLASS needed to hold a value of mode MODE.

     This is closely related to the macro `HARD_REGNO_NREGS'.  In fact,
     the value of the macro `CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)' should be
     the maximum value of `HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)' for all
     REGNO values in the class CLASS.

     This macro helps control the handling of multiple-word values in
     the reload pass.

 -- Macro: CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS (FROM, TO, CLASS)
     If defined, a C expression that returns nonzero for a CLASS for
     which a change from mode FROM to mode TO is invalid.

     For the example, loading 32-bit integer or floating-point objects
     into floating-point registers on the Alpha extends them to 64 bits.
     Therefore loading a 64-bit object and then storing it as a 32-bit
     object does not store the low-order 32 bits, as would be the case
     for a normal register.  Therefore, `alpha.h' defines
     `CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS' as below:

          #define CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS(FROM, TO, CLASS) \
            (GET_MODE_SIZE (FROM) != GET_MODE_SIZE (TO) \
             ? reg_classes_intersect_p (FLOAT_REGS, (CLASS)) : 0)

   Three other special macros describe which operands fit which
constraint letters.

 -- Macro: CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)
     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters (`I', `J', `K', ... `P') that specify
     particular ranges of integer values.  If C is one of those
     letters, the expression should check that VALUE, an integer, is in
     the appropriate range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is
     not one of those letters, the value should be 0 regardless of
     VALUE.

 -- Macro: CONST_OK_FOR_CONSTRAINT_P (VALUE, C, STR)
     Like `CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P', but you also get the constraint
     string passed in STR, so that you can use suffixes to distinguish
     between different variants.

 -- Macro: CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)
     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters that specify particular ranges of
     `const_double' values (`G' or `H').

     If C is one of those letters, the expression should check that
     VALUE, an RTX of code `const_double', is in the appropriate range
     and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is not one of those
     letters, the value should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

     `const_double' is used for all floating-point constants and for
     `DImode' fixed-point constants.  A given letter can accept either
     or both kinds of values.  It can use `GET_MODE' to distinguish
     between these kinds.

 -- Macro: CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_CONSTRAINT_P (VALUE, C, STR)
     Like `CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P', but you also get the
     constraint string passed in STR, so that you can use suffixes to
     distinguish between different variants.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_CONSTRAINT (VALUE, C)
     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
     constraint letters that can be used to segregate specific types of
     operands, usually memory references, for the target machine.  Any
     letter that is not elsewhere defined and not matched by
     `REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER' / `REG_CLASS_FROM_CONSTRAINT' may be used.
     Normally this macro will not be defined.

     If it is required for a particular target machine, it should
     return 1 if VALUE corresponds to the operand type represented by
     the constraint letter C.  If C is not defined as an extra
     constraint, the value returned should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

     For example, on the ROMP, load instructions cannot have their
     output in r0 if the memory reference contains a symbolic address.
     Constraint letter `Q' is defined as representing a memory address
     that does _not_ contain a symbolic address.  An alternative is
     specified with a `Q' constraint on the input and `r' on the
     output.  The next alternative specifies `m' on the input and a
     register class that does not include r0 on the output.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_CONSTRAINT_STR (VALUE, C, STR)
     Like `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT', but you also get the constraint string
     passed in STR, so that you can use suffixes to distinguish between
     different variants.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_MEMORY_CONSTRAINT (C, STR)
     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
     constraint letters, amongst those accepted by `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT',
     that should be treated like memory constraints by the reload pass.

     It should return 1 if the operand type represented by the
     constraint at the start of STR, the first letter of which is the
     letter C,  comprises a subset of all memory references including
     all those whose address is simply a base register.  This allows
     the reload pass to reload an operand, if it does not directly
     correspond to the operand type of C, by copying its address into a
     base register.

     For example, on the S/390, some instructions do not accept
     arbitrary memory references, but only those that do not make use
     of an index register.  The constraint letter `Q' is defined via
     `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT' as representing a memory address of this type.
     If the letter `Q' is marked as `EXTRA_MEMORY_CONSTRAINT', a `Q'
     constraint can handle any memory operand, because the reload pass
     knows it can be reloaded by copying the memory address into a base
     register if required.  This is analogous to the way a `o'
     constraint can handle any memory operand.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINT (C, STR)
     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
     constraint letters, amongst those accepted by `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT' /
     `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT_STR', that should be treated like address
     constraints by the reload pass.

     It should return 1 if the operand type represented by the
     constraint at the start of STR, which starts with the letter C,
     comprises a subset of all memory addresses including all those
     that consist of just a base register.  This allows the reload pass
     to reload an operand, if it does not directly correspond to the
     operand type of STR, by copying it into a base register.

     Any constraint marked as `EXTRA_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINT' can only be
     used with the `address_operand' predicate.  It is treated
     analogously to the `p' constraint.

11.10.1 Basic Stack Layout
--------------------------

Here is the basic stack layout.

 -- Macro: STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD
     Define this macro if pushing a word onto the stack moves the stack
     pointer to a smaller address.

     When we say, "define this macro if ...," it means that the
     compiler checks this macro only with `#ifdef' so the precise
     definition used does not matter.

 -- Macro: STACK_PUSH_CODE
     This macro defines the operation used when something is pushed on
     the stack.  In RTL, a push operation will be `(set (mem
     (STACK_PUSH_CODE (reg sp))) ...)'

     The choices are `PRE_DEC', `POST_DEC', `PRE_INC', and `POST_INC'.
     Which of these is correct depends on the stack direction and on
     whether the stack pointer points to the last item on the stack or
     whether it points to the space for the next item on the stack.

     The default is `PRE_DEC' when `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined,
     which is almost always right, and `PRE_INC' otherwise, which is
     often wrong.

 -- Macro: FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD
     Define this macro if the addresses of local variable slots are at
     negative offsets from the frame pointer.

 -- Macro: ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD
     Define this macro if successive arguments to a function occupy
     decreasing addresses on the stack.

 -- Macro: STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET
     Offset from the frame pointer to the first local variable slot to
     be allocated.

     If `FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD', find the next slot's offset by
     subtracting the first slot's length from `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.
     Otherwise, it is found by adding the length of the first slot to
     the value `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.

 -- Macro: STACK_ALIGNMENT_NEEDED
     Define to zero to disable final alignment of the stack during
     reload.  The nonzero default for this macro is suitable for most
     ports.

     On ports where `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET' is nonzero or where there
     is a register save block following the local block that doesn't
     require alignment to `STACK_BOUNDARY', it may be beneficial to
     disable stack alignment and do it in the backend.

 -- Macro: STACK_POINTER_OFFSET
     Offset from the stack pointer register to the first location at
     which outgoing arguments are placed.  If not specified, the
     default value of zero is used.  This is the proper value for most
     machines.

     If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
     the first location at which outgoing arguments are placed.

 -- Macro: FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (FUNDECL)
     Offset from the argument pointer register to the first argument's
     address.  On some machines it may depend on the data type of the
     function.

     If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
     the first argument's address.

 -- Macro: STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET (FUNDECL)
     Offset from the stack pointer register to an item dynamically
     allocated on the stack, e.g., by `alloca'.

     The default value for this macro is `STACK_POINTER_OFFSET' plus the
     length of the outgoing arguments.  The default is correct for most
     machines.  See `function.c' for details.

 -- Macro: DYNAMIC_CHAIN_ADDRESS (FRAMEADDR)
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the address in a
     stack frame where the pointer to the caller's frame is stored.
     Assume that FRAMEADDR is an RTL expression for the address of the
     stack frame itself.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is to return the value
     of FRAMEADDR--that is, the stack frame address is also the address
     of the stack word that points to the previous frame.

 -- Macro: SETUP_FRAME_ADDRESSES
     If defined, a C expression that produces the machine-specific code
     to setup the stack so that arbitrary frames can be accessed.  For
     example, on the SPARC, we must flush all of the register windows
     to the stack before we can access arbitrary stack frames.  You
     will seldom need to define this macro.

 -- Macro: BUILTIN_SETJMP_FRAME_VALUE
     If defined, a C expression that contains an rtx that is used to
     store the address of the current frame into the built in `setjmp'
     buffer.  The default value, `virtual_stack_vars_rtx', is correct
     for most machines.  One reason you may need to define this macro
     is if `hard_frame_pointer_rtx' is the appropriate value on your
     machine.

 -- Macro: RETURN_ADDR_RTX (COUNT, FRAMEADDR)
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the value of the
     return address for the frame COUNT steps up from the current
     frame, after the prologue.  FRAMEADDR is the frame pointer of the
     COUNT frame, or the frame pointer of the COUNT - 1 frame if
     `RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME' is defined.

     The value of the expression must always be the correct address when
     COUNT is zero, but may be `NULL_RTX' if there is not way to
     determine the return address of other frames.

 -- Macro: RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME
     Define this if the return address of a particular stack frame is
     accessed from the frame pointer of the previous stack frame.

 -- Macro: INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the location of the
     incoming return address at the beginning of any function, before
     the prologue.  This RTL is either a `REG', indicating that the
     return value is saved in `REG', or a `MEM' representing a location
     in the stack.

     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

     If this RTL is a `REG', you should also define
     `DWARF_FRAME_RETURN_COLUMN' to `DWARF_FRAME_REGNUM (REGNO)'.

 -- Macro: DWARF_ALT_FRAME_RETURN_COLUMN
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving a DWARF 2 column
     number that may be used as an alternate return column.  This should
     be defined only if `DWARF_FRAME_RETURN_COLUMN' is set to a general
     register, but an alternate column needs to be used for signal
     frames.

 -- Macro: DWARF_ZERO_REG
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving a DWARF 2 register
     number that is considered to always have the value zero.  This
     should only be defined if the target has an architected zero
     register, and someone decided it was a good idea to use that
     register number to terminate the stack backtrace.  New ports
     should avoid this.

 -- Macro: INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in
     bytes, from the value of the stack pointer register to the top of
     the stack frame at the beginning of any function, before the
     prologue.  The top of the frame is defined to be the value of the
     stack pointer in the previous frame, just before the call
     instruction.

     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

 -- Macro: ARG_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET (FUNDECL)
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in
     bytes, from the argument pointer to the canonical frame address
     (cfa).  The final value should coincide with that calculated by
     `INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET'.  Which is unfortunately not usable
     during virtual register instantiation.

     The default value for this macro is `FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (fundecl)',
     which is correct for most machines; in general, the arguments are
     found immediately before the stack frame.  Note that this is not
     the case on some targets that save registers into the caller's
     frame, such as SPARC and rs6000, and so such targets need to
     define this macro.

     You only need to define this macro if the default is incorrect,
     and you want to support call frame debugging information like that
     provided by DWARF 2.

11.10.2 Exception Handling Support
----------------------------------

 -- Macro: EH_RETURN_DATA_REGNO (N)
     A C expression whose value is the Nth register number used for
     data by exception handlers, or `INVALID_REGNUM' if fewer than N
     registers are usable.

     The exception handling library routines communicate with the
     exception handlers via a set of agreed upon registers.  Ideally
     these registers should be call-clobbered; it is possible to use
     call-saved registers, but may negatively impact code size.  The
     target must support at least 2 data registers, but should define 4
     if there are enough free registers.

     You must define this macro if you want to support call frame
     exception handling like that provided by DWARF 2.

 -- Macro: EH_RETURN_STACKADJ_RTX
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing a location in which
     to store a stack adjustment to be applied before function return.
     This is used to unwind the stack to an exception handler's call
     frame.  It will be assigned zero on code paths that return
     normally.

     Typically this is a call-clobbered hard register that is otherwise
     untouched by the epilogue, but could also be a stack slot.

     Do not define this macro if the stack pointer is saved and restored
     by the regular prolog and epilog code in the call frame itself; in
     this case, the exception handling library routines will update the
     stack location to be restored in place.  Otherwise, you must define
     this macro if you want to support call frame exception handling
     like that provided by DWARF 2.

 -- Macro: EH_RETURN_HANDLER_RTX
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing a location in which
     to store the address of an exception handler to which we should
     return.  It will not be assigned on code paths that return
     normally.

     Typically this is the location in the call frame at which the
     normal return address is stored.  For targets that return by
     popping an address off the stack, this might be a memory address
     just below the _target_ call frame rather than inside the current
     call frame.  If defined, `EH_RETURN_STACKADJ_RTX' will have already
     been assigned, so it may be used to calculate the location of the
     target call frame.

     Some targets have more complex requirements than storing to an
     address calculable during initial code generation.  In that case
     the `eh_return' instruction pattern should be used instead.

     If you want to support call frame exception handling, you must
     define either this macro or the `eh_return' instruction pattern.

 -- Macro: RETURN_ADDR_OFFSET
     If defined, an integer-valued C expression for which rtl will be
     generated to add it to the exception handler address before it is
     searched in the exception handling tables, and to subtract it
     again from the address before using it to return to the exception
     handler.

 -- Macro: ASM_PREFERRED_EH_DATA_FORMAT (CODE, GLOBAL)
     This macro chooses the encoding of pointers embedded in the
     exception handling sections.  If at all possible, this should be
     defined such that the exception handling section will not require
     dynamic relocations, and so may be read-only.

     CODE is 0 for data, 1 for code labels, 2 for function pointers.
     GLOBAL is true if the symbol may be affected by dynamic
     relocations.  The macro should return a combination of the
     `DW_EH_PE_*' defines as found in `dwarf2.h'.

     If this macro is not defined, pointers will not be encoded but
     represented directly.

 -- Macro: ASM_MAYBE_OUTPUT_ENCODED_ADDR_RTX (FILE, ENCODING, SIZE,
          ADDR, DONE)
     This macro allows the target to emit whatever special magic is
     required to represent the encoding chosen by
     `ASM_PREFERRED_EH_DATA_FORMAT'.  Generic code takes care of
     pc-relative and indirect encodings; this must be defined if the
     target uses text-relative or data-relative encodings.

     This is a C statement that branches to DONE if the format was
     handled.  ENCODING is the format chosen, SIZE is the number of
     bytes that the format occupies, ADDR is the `SYMBOL_REF' to be
     emitted.

 -- Macro: MD_FALLBACK_FRAME_STATE_FOR (CONTEXT, FS, SUCCESS)
     This macro allows the target to add cpu and operating system
     specific code to the call-frame unwinder for use when there is no
     unwind data available.  The most common reason to implement this
     macro is to unwind through signal frames.

     This macro is called from `uw_frame_state_for' in `unwind-dw2.c'
     and `unwind-ia64.c'.  CONTEXT is an `_Unwind_Context'; FS is an
     `_Unwind_FrameState'.  Examine `context->ra' for the address of
     the code being executed and `context->cfa' for the stack pointer
     value.  If the frame can be decoded, the register save addresses
     should be updated in FS and the macro should branch to SUCCESS.
     If the frame cannot be decoded, the macro should do nothing.

     For proper signal handling in Java this macro is accompanied by
     `MAKE_THROW_FRAME', defined in `libjava/include/*-signal.h'
     headers.

 -- Macro: MD_HANDLE_UNWABI (CONTEXT, FS)
     This macro allows the target to add operating system specific code
     to the call-frame unwinder to handle the IA-64 `.unwabi' unwinding
     directive, usually used for signal or interrupt frames.

     This macro is called from `uw_update_context' in `unwind-ia64.c'.
     CONTEXT is an `_Unwind_Context'; FS is an `_Unwind_FrameState'.
     Examine `fs->unwabi' for the abi and context in the `.unwabi'
     directive.  If the `.unwabi' directive can be handled, the
     register save addresses should be updated in FS.

11.10.3 Specifying How Stack Checking is Done
---------------------------------------------

GCC will check that stack references are within the boundaries of the
stack, if the `-fstack-check' is specified, in one of three ways:

  1. If the value of the `STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN' macro is nonzero, GCC
     will assume that you have arranged for stack checking to be done at
     appropriate places in the configuration files, e.g., in
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE'.  GCC will do not other special
     processing.

  2. If `STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN' is zero and you defined a named pattern
     called `check_stack' in your `md' file, GCC will call that pattern
     with one argument which is the address to compare the stack value
     against.  You must arrange for this pattern to report an error if
     the stack pointer is out of range.

  3. If neither of the above are true, GCC will generate code to
     periodically "probe" the stack pointer using the values of the
     macros defined below.

   Normally, you will use the default values of these macros, so GCC
will use the third approach.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN
     A nonzero value if stack checking is done by the configuration
     files in a machine-dependent manner.  You should define this macro
     if stack checking is require by the ABI of your machine or if you
     would like to have to stack checking in some more efficient way
     than GCC's portable approach.  The default value of this macro is
     zero.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_PROBE_INTERVAL
     An integer representing the interval at which GCC must generate
     stack probe instructions.  You will normally define this macro to
     be no larger than the size of the "guard pages" at the end of a
     stack area.  The default value of 4096 is suitable for most
     systems.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_PROBE_LOAD
     A integer which is nonzero if GCC should perform the stack probe
     as a load instruction and zero if GCC should use a store
     instruction.  The default is zero, which is the most efficient
     choice on most systems.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_PROTECT
     The number of bytes of stack needed to recover from a stack
     overflow, for languages where such a recovery is supported.  The
     default value of 75 words should be adequate for most machines.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_MAX_FRAME_SIZE
     The maximum size of a stack frame, in bytes.  GCC will generate
     probe instructions in non-leaf functions to ensure at least this
     many bytes of stack are available.  If a stack frame is larger
     than this size, stack checking will not be reliable and GCC will
     issue a warning.  The default is chosen so that GCC only generates
     one instruction on most systems.  You should normally not change
     the default value of this macro.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE
     GCC uses this value to generate the above warning message.  It
     represents the amount of fixed frame used by a function, not
     including space for any callee-saved registers, temporaries and
     user variables.  You need only specify an upper bound for this
     amount and will normally use the default of four words.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_MAX_VAR_SIZE
     The maximum size, in bytes, of an object that GCC will place in the
     fixed area of the stack frame when the user specifies
     `-fstack-check'.  GCC computed the default from the values of the
     above macros and you will normally not need to override that
     default.

11.10.4 Registers That Address the Stack Frame
----------------------------------------------

This discusses registers that address the stack frame.

 -- Macro: STACK_POINTER_REGNUM
     The register number of the stack pointer register, which must also
     be a fixed register according to `FIXED_REGISTERS'.  On most
     machines, the hardware determines which register this is.

 -- Macro: FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM
     The register number of the frame pointer register, which is used to
     access automatic variables in the stack frame.  On some machines,
     the hardware determines which register this is.  On other
     machines, you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.

 -- Macro: HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM
     On some machines the offset between the frame pointer and starting
     offset of the automatic variables is not known until after register
     allocation has been done (for example, because the saved registers
     are between these two locations).  On those machines, define
     `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' the number of a special, fixed register to
     be used internally until the offset is known, and define
     `HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' to be the actual hard register number
     used for the frame pointer.

     You should define this macro only in the very rare circumstances
     when it is not possible to calculate the offset between the frame
     pointer and the automatic variables until after register
     allocation has been completed.  When this macro is defined, you
     must also indicate in your definition of `ELIMINABLE_REGS' how to
     eliminate `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' into either
     `HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' or `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM'.

     Do not define this macro if it would be the same as
     `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'.

 -- Macro: ARG_POINTER_REGNUM
     The register number of the arg pointer register, which is used to
     access the function's argument list.  On some machines, this is
     the same as the frame pointer register.  On some machines, the
     hardware determines which register this is.  On other machines,
     you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.  If this is
     not the same register as the frame pointer register, then you must
     mark it as a fixed register according to `FIXED_REGISTERS', or
     arrange to be able to eliminate it (*note Elimination::).

 -- Macro: RETURN_ADDRESS_POINTER_REGNUM
     The register number of the return address pointer register, which
     is used to access the current function's return address from the
     stack.  On some machines, the return address is not at a fixed
     offset from the frame pointer or stack pointer or argument
     pointer.  This register can be defined to point to the return
     address on the stack, and then be converted by `ELIMINABLE_REGS'
     into either the frame pointer or stack pointer.

     Do not define this macro unless there is no other way to get the
     return address from the stack.

 -- Macro: STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM
 -- Macro: STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM
     Register numbers used for passing a function's static chain
     pointer.  If register windows are used, the register number as
     seen by the called function is `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM',
     while the register number as seen by the calling function is
     `STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM'.  If these registers are the same,
     `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM' need not be defined.

     The static chain register need not be a fixed register.

     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros should not be
     defined; instead, the next two macros should be defined.

 -- Macro: STATIC_CHAIN
 -- Macro: STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING
     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros provide rtx
     giving `mem' expressions that denote where they are stored.
     `STATIC_CHAIN' and `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING' give the locations as
     seen by the calling and called functions, respectively.  Often the
     former will be at an offset from the stack pointer and the latter
     at an offset from the frame pointer.

     The variables `stack_pointer_rtx', `frame_pointer_rtx', and
     `arg_pointer_rtx' will have been initialized prior to the use of
     these macros and should be used to refer to those items.

     If the static chain is passed in a register, the two previous
     macros should be defined instead.

 -- Macro: DWARF_FRAME_REGISTERS
     This macro specifies the maximum number of hard registers that can
     be saved in a call frame.  This is used to size data structures
     used in DWARF2 exception handling.

     Prior to GCC 3.0, this macro was needed in order to establish a
     stable exception handling ABI in the face of adding new hard
     registers for ISA extensions.  In GCC 3.0 and later, the EH ABI is
     insulated from changes in the number of hard registers.
     Nevertheless, this macro can still be used to reduce the runtime
     memory requirements of the exception handling routines, which can
     be substantial if the ISA contains a lot of registers that are not
     call-saved.

     If this macro is not defined, it defaults to
     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'.

 -- Macro: PRE_GCC3_DWARF_FRAME_REGISTERS
     This macro is similar to `DWARF_FRAME_REGISTERS', but is provided
     for backward compatibility in pre GCC 3.0 compiled code.

     If this macro is not defined, it defaults to
     `DWARF_FRAME_REGISTERS'.

 -- Macro: DWARF_REG_TO_UNWIND_COLUMN (REGNO)
     Define this macro if the target's representation for dwarf
     registers is different than the internal representation for unwind
     column.  Given a dwarf register, this macro should return the
     internal unwind column number to use instead.

     See the PowerPC's SPE target for an example.

 -- Macro: DWARF_FRAME_REGNUM (REGNO)
     Define this macro if the target's representation for dwarf
     registers used in .eh_frame or .debug_frame is different from that
     used in other debug info sections.  Given a GCC hard register
     number, this macro should return the .eh_frame register number.
     The default is `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (REGNO)'.


 -- Macro: DWARF2_FRAME_REG_OUT (REGNO, FOR_EH)
     Define this macro to map register numbers held in the call frame
     info that GCC has collected using `DWARF_FRAME_REGNUM' to those
     that should be output in .debug_frame (`FOR_EH' is zero) and
     .eh_frame (`FOR_EH' is nonzero).  The default is to return `REGNO'.

11.10.5 Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer
-------------------------------------------------

This is about eliminating the frame pointer and arg pointer.

 -- Macro: FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED
     A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a
     frame pointer.  This expression is evaluated  in the reload pass.
     If its value is nonzero the function will have a frame pointer.

     The expression can in principle examine the current function and
     decide according to the facts, but on most machines the constant 0
     or the constant 1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to
     be generated with no frame pointer, and doing so saves some time
     or space.  Use 1 when there is no possible advantage to avoiding a
     frame pointer.

     In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid
     code without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases
     and automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of
     what `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' says.  You don't need to worry about
     them.

     In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame
     pointer register can be allocated for ordinary usage, unless you
     mark it as a fixed register.  See `FIXED_REGISTERS' for more
     information.

 -- Macro: INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET (DEPTH-VAR)
     A C statement to store in the variable DEPTH-VAR the difference
     between the frame pointer and the stack pointer values immediately
     after the function prologue.  The value would be computed from
     information such as the result of `get_frame_size ()' and the
     tables of registers `regs_ever_live' and `call_used_regs'.

     If `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is defined, this macro will be not be used and
     need not be defined.  Otherwise, it must be defined even if
     `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' is defined to always be true; in that
     case, you may set DEPTH-VAR to anything.

 -- Macro: ELIMINABLE_REGS
     If defined, this macro specifies a table of register pairs used to
     eliminate unneeded registers that point into the stack frame.  If
     it is not defined, the only elimination attempted by the compiler
     is to replace references to the frame pointer with references to
     the stack pointer.

     The definition of this macro is a list of structure
     initializations, each of which specifies an original and
     replacement register.

     On some machines, the position of the argument pointer is not
     known until the compilation is completed.  In such a case, a
     separate hard register must be used for the argument pointer.
     This register can be eliminated by replacing it with either the
     frame pointer or the argument pointer, depending on whether or not
     the frame pointer has been eliminated.

     In this case, you might specify:
          #define ELIMINABLE_REGS  \
          {{ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
           {ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
           {FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}}

     Note that the elimination of the argument pointer with the stack
     pointer is specified first since that is the preferred elimination.

 -- Macro: CAN_ELIMINATE (FROM-REG, TO-REG)
     A C expression that returns nonzero if the compiler is allowed to
     try to replace register number FROM-REG with register number
     TO-REG.  This macro need only be defined if `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
     defined, and will usually be the constant 1, since most of the
     cases preventing register elimination are things that the compiler
     already knows about.

 -- Macro: INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET (FROM-REG, TO-REG, OFFSET-VAR)
     This macro is similar to `INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET'.  It
     specifies the initial difference between the specified pair of
     registers.  This macro must be defined if `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
     defined.

11.10.6 Passing Function Arguments on the Stack
-----------------------------------------------

The macros in this section control how arguments are passed on the
stack.  See the following section for other macros that control passing
certain arguments in registers.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_PROMOTE_PROTOTYPES (tree FNTYPE)
     This target hook returns `true' if an argument declared in a
     prototype as an integral type smaller than `int' should actually be
     passed as an `int'.  In addition to avoiding errors in certain
     cases of mismatch, it also makes for better code on certain
     machines.  The default is to not promote prototypes.

 -- Macro: PUSH_ARGS
     A C expression.  If nonzero, push insns will be used to pass
     outgoing arguments.  If the target machine does not have a push
     instruction, set it to zero.  That directs GCC to use an alternate
     strategy: to allocate the entire argument block and then store the
     arguments into it.  When `PUSH_ARGS' is nonzero, `PUSH_ROUNDING'
     must be defined too.

 -- Macro: PUSH_ARGS_REVERSED
     A C expression.  If nonzero, function arguments will be evaluated
     from last to first, rather than from first to last.  If this macro
     is not defined, it defaults to `PUSH_ARGS' on targets where the
     stack and args grow in opposite directions, and 0 otherwise.

 -- Macro: PUSH_ROUNDING (NPUSHED)
     A C expression that is the number of bytes actually pushed onto the
     stack when an instruction attempts to push NPUSHED bytes.

     On some machines, the definition

          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (BYTES)

     will suffice.  But on other machines, instructions that appear to
     push one byte actually push two bytes in an attempt to maintain
     alignment.  Then the definition should be

          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (((BYTES) + 1) & ~1)

 -- Macro: ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS
     A C expression.  If nonzero, the maximum amount of space required
     for outgoing arguments will be computed and placed into the
     variable `current_function_outgoing_args_size'.  No space will be
     pushed onto the stack for each call; instead, the function
     prologue should increase the stack frame size by this amount.

     Setting both `PUSH_ARGS' and `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is not
     proper.

 -- Macro: REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (FNDECL)
     Define this macro if functions should assume that stack space has
     been allocated for arguments even when their values are passed in
     registers.

     The value of this macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
     reserved for arguments passed in registers for the function
     represented by FNDECL, which can be zero if GCC is calling a
     library function.

     This space can be allocated by the caller, or be a part of the
     machine-dependent stack frame: `OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' says
     which.

 -- Macro: MAYBE_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE
 -- Macro: FINAL_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (CONST_SIZE, VAR_SIZE)
     Define these macros in addition to the one above if functions might
     allocate stack space for arguments even when their values are
     passed in registers.  These should be used when the stack space
     allocated for arguments in registers is not a simple constant
     independent of the function declaration.

     The value of the first macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
     that we should initially assume would be reserved for arguments
     passed in registers.

     The value of the second macro is the actual size, in bytes, of the
     area that will be reserved for arguments passed in registers.
     This takes two arguments: an integer representing the number of
     bytes of fixed sized arguments on the stack, and a tree
     representing the number of bytes of variable sized arguments on
     the stack.

     When these macros are defined, `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' will only be
     called for libcall functions, the current function, or for a
     function being called when it is known that such stack space must
     be allocated.  In each case this value can be easily computed.

     When deciding whether a called function needs such stack space,
     and how much space to reserve, GCC uses these two macros instead of
     `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'.

 -- Macro: OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE
     Define this if it is the responsibility of the caller to allocate
     the area reserved for arguments passed in registers.

     If `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, this macro controls
     whether the space for these arguments counts in the value of
     `current_function_outgoing_args_size'.

 -- Macro: STACK_PARMS_IN_REG_PARM_AREA
     Define this macro if `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is defined, but the
     stack parameters don't skip the area specified by it.

     Normally, when a parameter is not passed in registers, it is
     placed on the stack beyond the `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' area.
     Defining this macro suppresses this behavior and causes the
     parameter to be passed on the stack in its natural location.

 -- Macro: RETURN_POPS_ARGS (FUNDECL, FUNTYPE, STACK-SIZE)
     A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own
     arguments that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the function
     pops no arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all after
     the function returns.

     FUNDECL is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
     `FUNCTION_DECL' that describes the declaration of the function.
     From this you can obtain the `DECL_ATTRIBUTES' of the function.

     FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
     `FUNCTION_TYPE' that describes the data type of the function.
     From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
     arguments (if known).

     When a call to a library function is being considered, FUNDECL
     will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
     you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can
     do so by their names.  Note that "library function" in this
     context means a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is
     known specially in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C
     code being compiled.

     STACK-SIZE is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
     stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
     argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling
     function.

     On the VAX, all functions always pop their arguments, so the
     definition of this macro is STACK-SIZE.  On the 68000, using the
     standard calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so
     the value of the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an
     alternative calling convention is available in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments pop them but other functions
     (such as `printf') pop nothing (the caller pops all).  When this
     convention is in use, FUNTYPE is examined to determine whether a
     function takes a fixed number of arguments.

 -- Macro: CALL_POPS_ARGS (CUM)
     A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes a call
     sequence pops off the stack.  It is added to the value of
     `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' when compiling a function call.

     CUM is the variable in which all arguments to the called function
     have been accumulated.

     On certain architectures, such as the SH5, a call trampoline is
     used that pops certain registers off the stack, depending on the
     arguments that have been passed to the function.  Since this is a
     property of the call site, not of the called function,
     `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' is not appropriate.

11.10.7 Passing Arguments in Registers
--------------------------------------

This section describes the macros which let you control how various
types of arguments are passed in registers or how they are arranged in
the stack.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)
     A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
     in a register, and which register.

     The arguments are CUM, which summarizes all the previous
     arguments; MODE, the machine mode of the argument; TYPE, the data
     type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
     (which happens for C support library functions); and NAMED, which
     is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
     correspond to `...' in the called function's prototype.  TYPE can
     be an incomplete type if a syntax error has previously occurred.

     The value of the expression is usually either a `reg' RTX for the
     hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
     argument on the stack.

     For machines like the VAX and 68000, where normally all arguments
     are pushed, zero suffices as a definition.

     The value of the expression can also be a `parallel' RTX.  This is
     used when an argument is passed in multiple locations.  The mode
     of the `parallel' should be the mode of the entire argument.  The
     `parallel' holds any number of `expr_list' pairs; each one
     describes where part of the argument is passed.  In each
     `expr_list' the first operand must be a `reg' RTX for the hard
     register in which to pass this part of the argument, and the mode
     of the register RTX indicates how large this part of the argument
     is.  The second operand of the `expr_list' is a `const_int' which
     gives the offset in bytes into the entire argument of where this
     part starts.  As a special exception the first `expr_list' in the
     `parallel' RTX may have a first operand of zero.  This indicates
     that the entire argument is also stored on the stack.

     The last time this macro is called, it is called with `MODE ==
     VOIDmode', and its result is passed to the `call' or `call_value'
     pattern as operands 2 and 3 respectively.

     The usual way to make the ISO library `stdarg.h' work on a machine
     where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
     nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
     by making `FUNCTION_ARG' return 0 whenever NAMED is 0.

     You may use the macro `MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)' in the
     definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a
     type that must be passed in the stack.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
     is not defined and `FUNCTION_ARG' returns nonzero for such an
     argument, the compiler will abort.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is
     defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then
     loaded into a register.

 -- Macro: MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)
     Define as a C expression that evaluates to nonzero if we do not
     know how to pass TYPE solely in registers.  The file `expr.h'
     defines a definition that is usually appropriate, refer to
     `expr.h' for additional documentation.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)
     Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows", so
     that the register in which a function sees an arguments is not
     necessarily the same as the one in which the caller passed the
     argument.

     For such machines, `FUNCTION_ARG' computes the register in which
     the caller passes the value, and `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' should be
     defined in a similar fashion to tell the function being called
     where the arguments will arrive.

     If `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' is not defined, `FUNCTION_ARG' serves
     both purposes.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_PARTIAL_NREGS (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)
     A C expression for the number of words, at the beginning of an
     argument, that must be put in registers.  The value must be zero
     for arguments that are passed entirely in registers or that are
     entirely pushed on the stack.

     On some machines, certain arguments must be passed partially in
     registers and partially in memory.  On these machines, typically
     the first N words of arguments are passed in registers, and the
     rest on the stack.  If a multi-word argument (a `double' or a
     structure) crosses that boundary, its first few words must be
     passed in registers and the rest must be pushed.  This macro tells
     the compiler when this occurs, and how many of the words should go
     in registers.

     `FUNCTION_ARG' for these arguments should return the first
     register to be used by the caller for this argument; likewise
     `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG', for the called function.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)
     A C expression that indicates when an argument must be passed by
     reference.  If nonzero for an argument, a copy of that argument is
     made in memory and a pointer to the argument is passed instead of
     the argument itself.  The pointer is passed in whatever way is
     appropriate for passing a pointer to that type.

     On machines where `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is not defined, a suitable
     definition of this macro might be
          #define FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE\
          (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)  \
            MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)
     If defined, a C expression that indicates when it is the called
     function's responsibility to make a copy of arguments passed by
     invisible reference.  Normally, the caller makes a copy and passes
     the address of the copy to the routine being called.  When
     `FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES' is defined and is nonzero, the caller
     does not make a copy.  Instead, it passes a pointer to the "live"
     value.  The called function must not modify this value.  If it can
     be determined that the value won't be modified, it need not make a
     copy; otherwise a copy must be made.

 -- Macro: CUMULATIVE_ARGS
     A C type for declaring a variable that is used as the first
     argument of `FUNCTION_ARG' and other related values.  For some
     target machines, the type `int' suffices and can hold the number
     of bytes of argument so far.

     There is no need to record in `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' anything about the
     arguments that have been passed on the stack.  The compiler has
     other variables to keep track of that.  For target machines on
     which all arguments are passed on the stack, there is no need to
     store anything in `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'; however, the data structure
     must exist and should not be empty, so use `int'.

 -- Macro: INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME, FNDECL,
          N_NAMED_ARGS)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) for initializing the variable CUM
     for the state at the beginning of the argument list.  The variable
     has type `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.  The value of FNTYPE is the tree node
     for the data type of the function which will receive the args, or
     0 if the args are to a compiler support library function.  For
     direct calls that are not libcalls, FNDECL contain the declaration
     node of the function.  FNDECL is also set when
     `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is used to find arguments for the function
     being compiled.  N_NAMED_ARGS is set to the number of named
     arguments, including a structure return address if it is passed as
     a parameter, when making a call.  When processing incoming
     arguments, N_NAMED_ARGS is set to -1.

     When processing a call to a compiler support library function,
     LIBNAME identifies which one.  It is a `symbol_ref' rtx which
     contains the name of the function, as a string.  LIBNAME is 0 when
     an ordinary C function call is being processed.  Thus, each time
     this macro is called, either LIBNAME or FNTYPE is nonzero, but
     never both of them at once.

 -- Macro: INIT_CUMULATIVE_LIBCALL_ARGS (CUM, MODE, LIBNAME)
     Like `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' but only used for outgoing libcalls,
     it gets a `MODE' argument instead of FNTYPE, that would be `NULL'.
     INDIRECT would always be zero, too.  If this macro is not
     defined, `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (cum, NULL_RTX, libname, 0)' is
     used instead.

 -- Macro: INIT_CUMULATIVE_INCOMING_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME)
     Like `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' but overrides it for the purposes of
     finding the arguments for the function being compiled.  If this
     macro is undefined, `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is used instead.

     The value passed for LIBNAME is always 0, since library routines
     with special calling conventions are never compiled with GCC.  The
     argument LIBNAME exists for symmetry with `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the summarizer variable
     CUM to advance past an argument in the argument list.  The values
     MODE, TYPE and NAMED describe that argument.  Once this is done,
     the variable CUM is suitable for analyzing the _following_
     argument with `FUNCTION_ARG', etc.

     This macro need not do anything if the argument in question was
     passed on the stack.  The compiler knows how to track the amount
     of stack space used for arguments without any special help.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_PADDING (MODE, TYPE)
     If defined, a C expression which determines whether, and in which
     direction, to pad out an argument with extra space.  The value
     should be of type `enum direction': either `upward' to pad above
     the argument, `downward' to pad below, or `none' to inhibit
     padding.

     The _amount_ of padding is always just enough to reach the next
     multiple of `FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY'; this macro does not control
     it.

     This macro has a default definition which is right for most
     systems.  For little-endian machines, the default is to pad
     upward.  For big-endian machines, the default is to pad downward
     for an argument of constant size shorter than an `int', and upward
     otherwise.

 -- Macro: PAD_VARARGS_DOWN
     If defined, a C expression which determines whether the default
     implementation of va_arg will attempt to pad down before reading
     the next argument, if that argument is smaller than its aligned
     space as controlled by `PARM_BOUNDARY'.  If this macro is not
     defined, all such arguments are padded down if `BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'
     is true.

 -- Macro: BLOCK_REG_PADDING (MODE, TYPE, FIRST)
     Specify padding for the last element of a block move between
     registers and memory.  FIRST is nonzero if this is the only
     element.  Defining this macro allows better control of register
     function parameters on big-endian machines, without using
     `PARALLEL' rtl.  In particular, `MUST_PASS_IN_STACK' need not test
     padding and mode of types in registers, as there is no longer a
     "wrong" part of a register;  For example, a three byte aggregate
     may be passed in the high part of a register if so required.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY (MODE, TYPE)
     If defined, a C expression that gives the alignment boundary, in
     bits, of an argument with the specified mode and type.  If it is
     not defined, `PARM_BOUNDARY' is used for all arguments.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P (REGNO)
     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which function arguments are sometimes passed.  This
     does _not_ include implicit arguments such as the static chain and
     the structure-value address.  On many machines, no registers can be
     used for this purpose since all function arguments are pushed on
     the stack.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SPLIT_COMPLEX_ARG (tree TYPE)
     This hook should return true if parameter of type TYPE are passed
     as two scalar parameters.  By default, GCC will attempt to pack
     complex arguments into the target's word size.  Some ABIs require
     complex arguments to be split and treated as their individual
     components.  For example, on AIX64, complex floats should be
     passed in a pair of floating point registers, even though a
     complex float would fit in one 64-bit floating point register.

     The default value of this hook is `NULL', which is treated as
     always false.

11.10.8 How Scalar Function Values Are Returned
-----------------------------------------------

This section discusses the macros that control returning scalars as
values--values that can fit in registers.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)
     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
     function returns a value of data type VALTYPE.  VALTYPE is a tree
     node representing a data type.  Write `TYPE_MODE (VALTYPE)' to get
     the machine mode used to represent that type.  On many machines,
     only the mode is relevant.  (Actually, on most machines, scalar
     values are returned in the same place regardless of mode).

     The value of the expression is usually a `reg' RTX for the hard
     register where the return value is stored.  The value can also be a
     `parallel' RTX, if the return value is in multiple places.  See
     `FUNCTION_ARG' for an explanation of the `parallel' form.

     If `TARGET_PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN' returns true, you must apply
     the same promotion rules specified in `PROMOTE_MODE' if VALTYPE is
     a scalar type.

     If the precise function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
     (`FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention
     for specific functions when all their calls are known.

     `FUNCTION_VALUE' is not used for return vales with aggregate data
     types, because these are returned in another way.  See
     `TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX' and related macros, below.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)
     Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows" so
     that the register in which a function returns its value is not the
     same as the one in which the caller sees the value.

     For such machines, `FUNCTION_VALUE' computes the register in which
     the caller will see the value.  `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' should be
     defined in a similar fashion to tell the function where to put the
     value.

     If `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' is not defined, `FUNCTION_VALUE'
     serves both purposes.

     `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' is not used for return vales with
     aggregate data types, because these are returned in another way.
     See `TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX' and related macros, below.

 -- Macro: LIBCALL_VALUE (MODE)
     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
     library function returns a value of mode MODE.  If the precise
     function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
     (`FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention
     for specific functions when all their calls are known.

     Note that "library function" in this context means a compiler
     support routine, used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
     specially by the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
     compiled.

     The definition of `LIBRARY_VALUE' need not be concerned aggregate
     data types, because none of the library functions returns such
     types.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (REGNO)
     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which the values of called function may come back.

     A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as
     the second of a pair (for a value of type `double', say) need not
     be recognized by this macro.  So for most machines, this definition
     suffices:

          #define FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P(N) ((N) == 0)

     If the machine has register windows, so that the caller and the
     called function use different registers for the return value, this
     macro should recognize only the caller's register numbers.

 -- Macro: APPLY_RESULT_SIZE
     Define this macro if `untyped_call' and `untyped_return' need more
     space than is implied by `FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' for saving and
     restoring an arbitrary return value.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_RETURN_IN_MSB (tree TYPE)
     This hook should return true if values of type TYPE are returned
     at the most significant end of a register (in other words, if they
     are padded at the least significant end).  You can assume that TYPE
     is returned in a register; the caller is required to check this.

     Note that the register provided by `FUNCTION_VALUE' must be able
     to hold the complete return value.  For example, if a 1-, 2- or
     3-byte structure is returned at the most significant end of a
     4-byte register, `FUNCTION_VALUE' should provide an `SImode' rtx.

11.10.9 How Large Values Are Returned
-------------------------------------

When a function value's mode is `BLKmode' (and in some other cases),
the value is not returned according to `FUNCTION_VALUE' (*note Scalar
Return::).  Instead, the caller passes the address of a block of memory
in which the value should be stored.  This address is called the
"structure value address".

   This section describes how to control returning structure values in
memory.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_RETURN_IN_MEMORY (tree TYPE, tree FNTYPE)
     This target hook should return a nonzero value to say to return the
     function value in memory, just as large structures are always
     returned.  Here TYPE will be the data type of the value, and FNTYPE
     will be the type of the function doing the returning, or `NULL' for
     libcalls.

     Note that values of mode `BLKmode' must be explicitly handled by
     this function.  Also, the option `-fpcc-struct-return' takes
     effect regardless of this macro.  On most systems, it is possible
     to leave the hook undefined; this causes a default definition to
     be used, whose value is the constant 1 for `BLKmode' values, and 0
     otherwise.

     Do not use this hook to indicate that structures and unions should
     always be returned in memory.  You should instead use
     `DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN' to indicate this.

 -- Macro: DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN
     Define this macro to be 1 if all structure and union return values
     must be in memory.  Since this results in slower code, this should
     be defined only if needed for compatibility with other compilers
     or with an ABI.  If you define this macro to be 0, then the
     conventions used for structure and union return values are decided
     by the `TARGET_RETURN_IN_MEMORY' target hook.

     If not defined, this defaults to the value 1.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX (tree FNDECL, int INCOMING)
     This target hook should return the location of the structure value
     address (normally a `mem' or `reg'), or 0 if the address is passed
     as an "invisible" first argument.  Note that FNDECL may be `NULL',
     for libcalls.

     On some architectures the place where the structure value address
     is found by the called function is not the same place that the
     caller put it.  This can be due to register windows, or it could
     be because the function prologue moves it to a different place.
     INCOMING is `true' when the location is needed in the context of
     the called function, and `false' in the context of the caller.

     If INCOMING is `true' and the address is to be found on the stack,
     return a `mem' which refers to the frame pointer.

 -- Macro: PCC_STATIC_STRUCT_RETURN
     Define this macro if the usual system convention on the target
     machine for returning structures and unions is for the called
     function to return the address of a static variable containing the
     value.

     Do not define this if the usual system convention is for the
     caller to pass an address to the subroutine.

     This macro has effect in `-fpcc-struct-return' mode, but it does
     nothing when you use `-freg-struct-return' mode.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Caller Saves,  Next: Function Entry,  Prev: Aggregate Return,  Up: Stack and Calling

11.10.10 Caller-Saves Register Allocation
-----------------------------------------

If you enable it, GCC can save registers around function calls.  This
makes it possible to use call-clobbered registers to hold variables that
must live across calls.

 -- Macro: CALLER_SAVE_PROFITABLE (REFS, CALLS)
     A C expression to determine whether it is worthwhile to consider
     placing a pseudo-register in a call-clobbered hard register and
     saving and restoring it around each function call.  The expression
     should be 1 when this is worth doing, and 0 otherwise.

     If you don't define this macro, a default is used which is good on
     most machines: `4 * CALLS < REFS'.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_CALLER_SAVE_MODE (REGNO, NREGS)
     A C expression specifying which mode is required for saving NREGS
     of a pseudo-register in call-clobbered hard register REGNO.  If
     REGNO is unsuitable for caller save, `VOIDmode' should be
     returned.  For most machines this macro need not be defined since
     GCC will select the smallest suitable mode.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Function Entry,  Next: Profiling,  Prev: Caller Saves,  Up: Stack and Calling

11.10.11 Function Entry and Exit
--------------------------------

This section describes the macros that output function entry
("prologue") and exit ("epilogue") code.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (FILE *FILE,
          HOST_WIDE_INT SIZE)
     If defined, a function that outputs the assembler code for entry
     to a function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the
     stack frame, initializing the frame pointer register, saving
     registers that must be saved, and allocating SIZE additional bytes
     of storage for the local variables.  SIZE is an integer.  FILE is
     a stdio stream to which the assembler code should be output.

     The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by
     this macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.

     To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the
     array `regs_ever_live': element R is nonzero if hard register R is
     used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
     prologue should save register R, provided it is not one of the
     call-used registers.  (`TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must
     likewise use `regs_ever_live'.)

     On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code
     does not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows,
     even if they are supposed to be preserved by function calls;
     instead it takes appropriate steps to "push" the register stack,
     if any non-call-used registers are used in the function.

     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
     function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
     pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether
     a frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
     `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 at run
     time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  *Note
     Elimination::.

     The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack
     space required for the function.  This stack space consists of the
     regions listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated
     in the order listed, with the last listed region closest to the
     top of the stack (the lowest address if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is
     defined, and the highest address if it is not defined).  You can
     use a different order for a machine if doing so is more convenient
     or required for compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where
     required by standard or by a debugger, there is no reason why the
     stack layout used by GCC need agree with that used by other
     compilers for a machine.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_END_PROLOGUE (FILE *FILE)
     If defined, a function that outputs assembler code at the end of a
     prologue.  This should be used when the function prologue is being
     emitted as RTL, and you have some extra assembler that needs to be
     emitted.  *Note prologue instruction pattern::.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_BEGIN_EPILOGUE (FILE *FILE)
     If defined, a function that outputs assembler code at the start of
     an epilogue.  This should be used when the function epilogue is
     being emitted as RTL, and you have some extra assembler that needs
     to be emitted.  *Note epilogue instruction pattern::.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (FILE *FILE,
          HOST_WIDE_INT SIZE)
     If defined, a function that outputs the assembler code for exit
     from a function.  The epilogue is responsible for restoring the
     saved registers and stack pointer to their values when the
     function was called, and returning control to the caller.  This
     macro takes the same arguments as the macro
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE', and the registers to restore are
     determined from `regs_ever_live' and `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' in the
     same way.

     On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the
     work of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
     instruction the name `return' and do not define the macro
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' at all.

     Do not define a pattern named `return' if you want the
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to be used.  If you want the target
     switches to control whether return instructions or epilogues are
     used, define a `return' pattern with a validity condition that
     tests the target switches appropriately.  If the `return'
     pattern's validity condition is false, epilogues will be used.

     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
     function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for
     these two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a
     frame pointer is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
     `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 when
     compiling a function that needs a frame pointer.

     Normally, `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat leaf functions specially.
     The C variable `current_function_is_leaf' is nonzero for such a
     function.  *Note Leaf Functions::.

     On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
     others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020
     when given `-mrtd' pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
     number of arguments.

     Your definition of the macro `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' decides which
     functions pop their own arguments.  `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'
     needs to know what was decided.  The variable that is called
     `current_function_pops_args' is the number of bytes of its
     arguments that a function should pop.  *Note Scalar Return::.

   * A region of `current_function_pretend_args_size' bytes of
     uninitialized space just underneath the first argument arriving on
     the stack.  (This may not be at the very start of the allocated
     stack region if the calling sequence has pushed anything else
     since pushing the stack arguments.  But usually, on such machines,
     nothing else has been pushed yet, because the function prologue
     itself does all the pushing.)  This region is used on machines
     where an argument may be passed partly in registers and partly in
     memory, and, in some cases to support the features in `<stdarg.h>'.

   * An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the
     function.  The size of this area, which may also include space for
     such things as the return address and pointers to previous stack
     frames, is machine-specific and usually depends on which registers
     have been used in the function.  Machines with register windows
     often do not require a save area.

   * A region of at least SIZE bytes, possibly rounded up to an
     allocation boundary, to contain the local variables of the
     function.  On some machines, this region and the save area may
     occur in the opposite order, with the save area closer to the top
     of the stack.

   * Optionally, when `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, a region of
     `current_function_outgoing_args_size' bytes to be used for outgoing
     argument lists of the function.  *Note Stack Arguments::.

   Normally, it is necessary for the macros
`TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to
treat leaf functions specially.  The C variable
`current_function_is_leaf' is nonzero for such a function.

 -- Macro: EXIT_IGNORE_STACK
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if the return
     instruction or the function epilogue ignores the value of the stack
     pointer; in other words, if it is safe to delete an instruction to
     adjust the stack pointer before a return from the function.  The
     default is 0.

     Note that this macro's value is relevant only for functions for
     which frame pointers are maintained.  It is never safe to delete a
     final stack adjustment in a function that has no frame pointer,
     and the compiler knows this regardless of `EXIT_IGNORE_STACK'.

 -- Macro: EPILOGUE_USES (REGNO)
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero for registers
     that are used by the epilogue or the `return' pattern.  The stack
     and frame pointer registers are already be assumed to be used as
     needed.

 -- Macro: EH_USES (REGNO)
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero for registers
     that are used by the exception handling mechanism, and so should
     be considered live on entry to an exception edge.

 -- Macro: DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE
     Define this macro if the function epilogue contains delay slots to
     which instructions from the rest of the function can be "moved".
     The definition should be a C expression whose value is an integer
     representing the number of delay slots there.

 -- Macro: ELIGIBLE_FOR_EPILOGUE_DELAY (INSN, N)
     A C expression that returns 1 if INSN can be placed in delay slot
     number N of the epilogue.

     The argument N is an integer which identifies the delay slot now
     being considered (since different slots may have different rules of
     eligibility).  It is never negative and is always less than the
     number of epilogue delay slots (what `DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'
     returns).  If you reject a particular insn for a given delay slot,
     in principle, it may be reconsidered for a subsequent delay slot.
     Also, other insns may (at least in principle) be considered for
     the so far unfilled delay slot.

     The insns accepted to fill the epilogue delay slots are put in an
     RTL list made with `insn_list' objects, stored in the variable
     `current_function_epilogue_delay_list'.  The insn for the first
     delay slot comes first in the list.  Your definition of the macro
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' should fill the delay slots by
     outputting the insns in this list, usually by calling
     `final_scan_insn'.

     You need not define this macro if you did not define
     `DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK (FILE *FILE, tree
          THUNK_FNDECL, HOST_WIDE_INT DELTA, HOST_WIDE_INT
          VCALL_OFFSET, tree FUNCTION)
     A function that outputs the assembler code for a thunk function,
     used to implement C++ virtual function calls with multiple
     inheritance.  The thunk acts as a wrapper around a virtual
     function, adjusting the implicit object parameter before handing
     control off to the real function.

     First, emit code to add the integer DELTA to the location that
     contains the incoming first argument.  Assume that this argument
     contains a pointer, and is the one used to pass the `this' pointer
     in C++.  This is the incoming argument _before_ the function
     prologue, e.g. `%o0' on a sparc.  The addition must preserve the
     values of all other incoming arguments.

     Then, if VCALL_OFFSET is nonzero, an additional adjustment should
     be made after adding `delta'.  In particular, if P is the adjusted
     pointer, the following adjustment should be made:

          p += (*((ptrdiff_t **)p))[vcall_offset/sizeof(ptrdiff_t)]

     After the additions, emit code to jump to FUNCTION, which is a
     `FUNCTION_DECL'.  This is a direct pure jump, not a call, and does
     not touch the return address.  Hence returning from FUNCTION will
     return to whoever called the current `thunk'.

     The effect must be as if FUNCTION had been called directly with
     the adjusted first argument.  This macro is responsible for
     emitting all of the code for a thunk function;
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'
     are not invoked.

     The THUNK_FNDECL is redundant.  (DELTA and FUNCTION have already
     been extracted from it.)  It might possibly be useful on some
     targets, but probably not.

     If you do not define this macro, the target-independent code in
     the C++ front end will generate a less efficient heavyweight thunk
     that calls FUNCTION instead of jumping to it.  The generic
     approach does not support varargs.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_CAN_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK (tree
          THUNK_FNDECL, HOST_WIDE_INT DELTA, HOST_WIDE_INT
          VCALL_OFFSET, tree FUNCTION)
     A function that returns true if TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK would
     be able to output the assembler code for the thunk function
     specified by the arguments it is passed, and false otherwise.  In
     the latter case, the generic approach will be used by the C++
     front end, with the limitations previously exposed.

11.10.12 Generating Code for Profiling
--------------------------------------

These macros will help you generate code for profiling.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_PROFILER (FILE, LABELNO)
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
     assembler code to call the profiling subroutine `mcount'.

     The details of how `mcount' expects to be called are determined by
     your operating system environment, not by GCC.  To figure them out,
     compile a small program for profiling using the system's installed
     C compiler and look at the assembler code that results.

     Older implementations of `mcount' expect the address of a counter
     variable to be loaded into some register.  The name of this
     variable is `LP' followed by the number LABELNO, so you would
     generate the name using `LP%d' in a `fprintf'.

 -- Macro: PROFILE_HOOK
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some assembly
     code to call the profiling subroutine `mcount' even the target does
     not support profiling.

 -- Macro: NO_PROFILE_COUNTERS
     Define this macro if the `mcount' subroutine on your system does
     not need a counter variable allocated for each function.  This is
     true for almost all modern implementations.  If you define this
     macro, you must not use the LABELNO argument to
     `FUNCTION_PROFILER'.

 -- Macro: PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE
     Define this macro if the code for function profiling should come
     before the function prologue.  Normally, the profiling code comes
     after.

11.10.13 Permitting tail calls
------------------------------

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FUNCTION_OK_FOR_SIBCALL (tree DECL, tree
          EXP)
     True if it is ok to do sibling call optimization for the specified
     call expression EXP.  DECL will be the called function, or `NULL'
     if this is an indirect call.

     It is not uncommon for limitations of calling conventions to
     prevent tail calls to functions outside the current unit of
     translation, or during PIC compilation.  The hook is used to
     enforce these restrictions, as the `sibcall' md pattern can not
     fail, or fall over to a "normal" call.  The criteria for
     successful sibling call optimization may vary greatly between
     different architectures.

11.11 Implementing the Varargs Macros
=====================================

GCC comes with an implementation of `<varargs.h>' and `<stdarg.h>' that
work without change on machines that pass arguments on the stack.
Other machines require their own implementations of varargs, and the
two machine independent header files must have conditionals to include
it.

   ISO `<stdarg.h>' differs from traditional `<varargs.h>' mainly in
the calling convention for `va_start'.  The traditional implementation
takes just one argument, which is the variable in which to store the
argument pointer.  The ISO implementation of `va_start' takes an
additional second argument.  The user is supposed to write the last
named argument of the function here.

   However, `va_start' should not use this argument.  The way to find
the end of the named arguments is with the built-in functions described
below.

 -- Macro: __builtin_saveregs ()
     Use this built-in function to save the argument registers in
     memory so that the varargs mechanism can access them.  Both ISO
     and traditional versions of `va_start' must use
     `__builtin_saveregs', unless you use `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' (see
     below) instead.

     On some machines, `__builtin_saveregs' is open-coded under the
     control of the macro `EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  On other machines,
     it calls a routine written in assembler language, found in
     `libgcc2.c'.

     Code generated for the call to `__builtin_saveregs' appears at the
     beginning of the function, as opposed to where the call to
     `__builtin_saveregs' is written, regardless of what the code is.
     This is because the registers must be saved before the function
     starts to use them for its own purposes.

 -- Macro: __builtin_args_info (CATEGORY)
     Use this built-in function to find the first anonymous arguments in
     registers.

     In general, a machine may have several categories of registers
     used for arguments, each for a particular category of data types.
     (For example, on some machines, floating-point registers are used
     for floating-point arguments while other arguments are passed in
     the general registers.)  To make non-varargs functions use the
     proper calling convention, you have defined the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'
     data type to record how many registers in each category have been
     used so far

     `__builtin_args_info' accesses the same data structure of type
     `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' after the ordinary argument layout is finished
     with it, with CATEGORY specifying which word to access.  Thus, the
     value indicates the first unused register in a given category.

     Normally, you would use `__builtin_args_info' in the implementation
     of `va_start', accessing each category just once and storing the
     value in the `va_list' object.  This is because `va_list' will
     have to update the values, and there is no way to alter the values
     accessed by `__builtin_args_info'.

 -- Macro: __builtin_next_arg (LASTARG)
     This is the equivalent of `__builtin_args_info', for stack
     arguments.  It returns the address of the first anonymous stack
     argument, as type `void *'.  If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', it returns
     the address of the location above the first anonymous stack
     argument.  Use it in `va_start' to initialize the pointer for
     fetching arguments from the stack.  Also use it in `va_start' to
     verify that the second parameter LASTARG is the last named argument
     of the current function.

 -- Macro: __builtin_classify_type (OBJECT)
     Since each machine has its own conventions for which data types are
     passed in which kind of register, your implementation of `va_arg'
     has to embody these conventions.  The easiest way to categorize the
     specified data type is to use `__builtin_classify_type' together
     with `sizeof' and `__alignof__'.

     `__builtin_classify_type' ignores the value of OBJECT, considering
     only its data type.  It returns an integer describing what kind of
     type that is--integer, floating, pointer, structure, and so on.

     The file `typeclass.h' defines an enumeration that you can use to
     interpret the values of `__builtin_classify_type'.

   These machine description macros help implement varargs:

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS (void)
     If defined, this hook produces the machine-specific code for a
     call to `__builtin_saveregs'.  This code will be moved to the very
     beginning of the function, before any parameter access are made.
     The return value of this function should be an RTX that contains
     the value to use as the return of `__builtin_saveregs'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (CUMULATIVE_ARGS
          *ARGS_SO_FAR, enum machine_mode MODE, tree TYPE, int
          *PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE, int SECOND_TIME)
     This target hook offers an alternative to using
     `__builtin_saveregs' and defining the hook
     `TARGET_EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  Use it to store the anonymous
     register arguments into the stack so that all the arguments appear
     to have been passed consecutively on the stack.  Once this is
     done, you can use the standard implementation of varargs that
     works for machines that pass all their arguments on the stack.

     The argument ARGS_SO_FAR points to the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' data
     structure, containing the values that are obtained after
     processing the named arguments.  The arguments MODE and TYPE
     describe the last named argument--its machine mode and its data
     type as a tree node.

     The target hook should do two things: first, push onto the stack
     all the argument registers _not_ used for the named arguments, and
     second, store the size of the data thus pushed into the
     `int'-valued variable pointed to by PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE.  The value
     that you store here will serve as additional offset for setting up
     the stack frame.

     Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
     compile time without knowing their data types,
     `TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is only useful on machines that
     have just a single category of argument register and use it
     uniformly for all data types.

     If the argument SECOND_TIME is nonzero, it means that the
     arguments of the function are being analyzed for the second time.
     This happens for an inline function, which is not actually
     compiled until the end of the source file.  The hook
     `TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' should not generate any
     instructions in this case.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING (CUMULATIVE_ARGS
          *CA)
     Define this hook to return `true' if the location where a function
     argument is passed depends on whether or not it is a named
     argument.

     This hook controls how the NAMED argument to `FUNCTION_ARG' is set
     for varargs and stdarg functions.  If this hook returns `true',
     the NAMED argument is always true for named arguments, and false
     for unnamed arguments.  If it returns `false', but
     `TARGET_PRETEND_OUTOGOING_VARARGS_NAMED' returns `true', then all
     arguments are treated as named.  Otherwise, all named arguments
     except the last are treated as named.

     You need not define this hook if it always returns zero.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_PRETEND_OUTGOING_VARARGS_NAMED
     If you need to conditionally change ABIs so that one works with
     `TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS', but the other works like neither
     `TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' nor
     `TARGET_STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING' was defined, then define this hook
     to return `true' if `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is used, `false'
     otherwise.  Otherwise, you should not define this hook.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Trampolines,  Next: Library Calls,  Prev: Varargs,  Up: Target Macros

11.12 Trampolines for Nested Functions
======================================

A "trampoline" is a small piece of code that is created at run time
when the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on
the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros
tell GCC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a trampoline.

   The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a
constant address into the static chain register, and jump to the real
address of the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k,
this requires two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the
two addresses exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.
On RISC machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a
register in two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate
immediate operands.

   The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the
variable parts--the static chain value and the function address--into
the immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
separately.

 -- Macro: TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE (FILE)
     A C statement to output, on the stream FILE, assembler code for a
     block of data that contains the constant parts of a trampoline.
     This code should not include a label--the label is taken care of
     automatically.

     If you do not define this macro, it means no template is needed
     for the target.  Do not define this macro on systems where the
     block move code to copy the trampoline into place would be larger
     than the code to generate it on the spot.

 -- Macro: TRAMPOLINE_SECTION
     The name of a subroutine to switch to the section in which the
     trampoline template is to be placed (*note Sections::).  The
     default is a value of `readonly_data_section', which places the
     trampoline in the section containing read-only data.

 -- Macro: TRAMPOLINE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bytes of the trampoline, as an
     integer.

 -- Macro: TRAMPOLINE_ALIGNMENT
     Alignment required for trampolines, in bits.

     If you don't define this macro, the value of `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
     is used for aligning trampolines.

 -- Macro: INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE (ADDR, FNADDR, STATIC_CHAIN)
     A C statement to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline.
     ADDR is an RTX for the address of the trampoline; FNADDR is an RTX
     for the address of the nested function; STATIC_CHAIN is an RTX for
     the static chain value that should be passed to the function when
     it is called.

 -- Macro: TRAMPOLINE_ADJUST_ADDRESS (ADDR)
     A C statement that should perform any machine-specific adjustment
     in the address of the trampoline.  Its argument contains the
     address that was passed to `INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE'.  In case the
     address to be used for a function call should be different from
     the address in which the template was stored, the different
     address should be assigned to ADDR.  If this macro is not defined,
     ADDR will be used for function calls.

     If this macro is not defined, by default the trampoline is
     allocated as a stack slot.  This default is right for most
     machines.  The exceptions are machines where it is impossible to
     execute instructions in the stack area.  On such machines, you may
     have to implement a separate stack, using this macro in
     conjunction with `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and
     `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'.

     FP points to a data structure, a `struct function', which
     describes the compilation status of the immediate containing
     function of the function which the trampoline is for.  The stack
     slot for the trampoline is in the stack frame of this containing
     function.  Other allocation strategies probably must do something
     analogous with this information.

   Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they
have separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack
location fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when
the program jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.

   Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts
of the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is
to make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
latter makes initialization faster.

   To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized,
define the following macro.

 -- Macro: CLEAR_INSN_CACHE (BEG, END)
     If defined, expands to a C expression clearing the _instruction
     cache_ in the specified interval.  The definition of this macro
     would typically be a series of `asm' statements.  Both BEG and END
     are both pointer expressions.

   The operating system may also require the stack to be made executable
before calling the trampoline.  To implement this requirement, define
the following macro.

 -- Macro: ENABLE_EXECUTE_STACK
     Define this macro if certain operations must be performed before
     executing code located on the stack.  The macro should expand to a
     series of C file-scope constructs (e.g. functions) and provide a
     unique entry point named `__enable_execute_stack'.  The target is
     responsible for emitting calls to the entry point in the code, for
     example from the `INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE' macro.

   To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In
addition, you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill
an entire cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that
the beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same
point in its cache line.  Look in `m68k.h' as a guide.

 -- Macro: TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE
     Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do
     their work.  The macro should expand to a series of `asm'
     statements which will be compiled with GCC.  They go in a library
     function named `__transfer_from_trampoline'.

     If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a
     compiled C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so
     by placing a special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use
     one `asm' statement to generate an assembler label, and another to
     make the label global.  Then trampolines can use that label to
     jump directly to your special assembler code.

11.13 Implicit Calls to Library Routines
========================================

Here is an explanation of implicit calls to library routines.

 -- Macro: DECLARE_LIBRARY_RENAMES
     This macro, if defined, should expand to a piece of C code that
     will get expanded when compiling functions for libgcc.a.  It can
     be used to provide alternate names for GCC's internal library
     functions if there are ABI-mandated names that the compiler should
     provide.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_INIT_LIBFUNCS (void)
     This hook should declare additional library routines or rename
     existing ones, using the functions `set_optab_libfunc' and
     `init_one_libfunc' defined in `optabs.c'.  `init_optabs' calls
     this macro after initializing all the normal library routines.

     The default is to do nothing.  Most ports don't need to define
     this hook.

 -- Macro: TARGET_FLOAT_LIB_COMPARE_RETURNS_BOOL (MODE, COMPARISON)
     This macro should return `true' if the library routine that
     implements the floating point comparison operator COMPARISON in
     mode MODE will return a boolean, and FALSE if it will return a
     tristate.

     GCC's own floating point libraries return tristates from the
     comparison operators, so the default returns false always.  Most
     ports don't need to define this macro.

 -- Macro: US_SOFTWARE_GOFAST
     Define this macro if your system C library uses the US Software
     GOFAST library to provide floating point emulation.

     In addition to defining this macro, your architecture must set
     `TARGET_INIT_LIBFUNCS' to `gofast_maybe_init_libfuncs', or else
     call that function from its version of that hook.  It is defined
     in `config/gofast.h', which must be included by your
     architecture's `CPU.c' file.  See `sparc/sparc.c' for an example.

     If this macro is defined, the
     `TARGET_FLOAT_LIB_COMPARE_RETURNS_BOOL' target hook must return
     false for `SFmode' and `DFmode' comparisons.

 -- Macro: TARGET_EDOM
     The value of `EDOM' on the target machine, as a C integer constant
     expression.  If you don't define this macro, GCC does not attempt
     to deposit the value of `EDOM' into `errno' directly.  Look in
     `/usr/include/errno.h' to find the value of `EDOM' on your system.

     If you do not define `TARGET_EDOM', then compiled code reports
     domain errors by calling the library function and letting it
     report the error.  If mathematical functions on your system use
     `matherr' when there is an error, then you should leave
     `TARGET_EDOM' undefined so that `matherr' is used normally.

 -- Macro: GEN_ERRNO_RTX
     Define this macro as a C expression to create an rtl expression
     that refers to the global "variable" `errno'.  (On certain systems,
     `errno' may not actually be a variable.)  If you don't define this
     macro, a reasonable default is used.

 -- Macro: TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS
     Define this macro if GCC should generate calls to the ISO C (and
     System V) library functions `memcpy', `memmove' and `memset'
     rather than the BSD functions `bcopy' and `bzero'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_C99_FUNCTIONS
     When this macro is nonzero, GCC will implicitly optimize `sin'
     calls into `sinf' and similarly for other functions defined by C99
     standard.  The default is nonzero that should be proper value for
     most modern systems, however number of existing systems lacks
     support for these functions in the runtime so they needs this
     macro to be redefined to 0.

 -- Macro: NEXT_OBJC_RUNTIME
     Define this macro to generate code for Objective-C message sending
     using the calling convention of the NeXT system.  This calling
     convention involves passing the object, the selector and the
     method arguments all at once to the method-lookup library function.

     The default calling convention passes just the object and the
     selector to the lookup function, which returns a pointer to the
     method.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Addressing Modes,  Next: Condition Code,  Prev: Library Calls,  Up: Target Macros

11.14 Addressing Modes
======================

This is about addressing modes.

 -- Macro: HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT
 -- Macro: HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT
 -- Macro: HAVE_POST_INCREMENT
 -- Macro: HAVE_POST_DECREMENT
     A C expression that is nonzero if the machine supports
     pre-increment, pre-decrement, post-increment, or post-decrement
     addressing respectively.

 -- Macro: HAVE_PRE_MODIFY_DISP
 -- Macro: HAVE_POST_MODIFY_DISP
     A C expression that is nonzero if the machine supports pre- or
     post-address side-effect generation involving constants other than
     the size of the memory operand.

 -- Macro: HAVE_PRE_MODIFY_REG
 -- Macro: HAVE_POST_MODIFY_REG
     A C expression that is nonzero if the machine supports pre- or
     post-address side-effect generation involving a register
     displacement.

 -- Macro: CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P (X)
     A C expression that is 1 if the RTX X is a constant which is a
     valid address.  On most machines, this can be defined as
     `CONSTANT_P (X)', but a few machines are more restrictive in which
     constant addresses are supported.

 -- Macro: CONSTANT_P (X)
     `CONSTANT_P', which is defined by target-independent code, accepts
     integer-values expressions whose values are not explicitly known,
     such as `symbol_ref', `label_ref', and `high' expressions and
     `const' arithmetic expressions, in addition to `const_int' and
     `const_double' expressions.

 -- Macro: MAX_REGS_PER_ADDRESS
     A number, the maximum number of registers that can appear in a
     valid memory address.  Note that it is up to you to specify a
     value equal to the maximum number that `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'
     would ever accept.

 -- Macro: GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, LABEL)
     A C compound statement with a conditional `goto LABEL;' executed
     if X (an RTX) is a legitimate memory address on the target machine
     for a memory operand of mode MODE.

     It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
     subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
     understand.

     This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
     non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
     must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
     allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
     contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
     with no hard register must be rejected.

     The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be
     defined to accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some
     kind of register is required.

     Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
     macro define the macro `REG_OK_STRICT'.  You should use an `#ifdef
     REG_OK_STRICT' conditional to define the strict variant in that
     case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

     Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes
     (one for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are
     typically among the subroutines used to define
     `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'.  Then only these subroutine macros
     need have two variants; the higher levels of macros may be the
     same whether strict or not.

     Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a `symbol_ref'
     and an integer are stored inside a `const' RTX to mark them as
     constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
     specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
     recognize any `const' as legitimate.

     Usually `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS' is not prepared to handle constant
     sums that are not marked with  `const'.  It assumes that a naked
     `plus' indicates indexing.  If so, then you _must_ reject such
     naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of
     them will be given to `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.

     On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends
     on the section that the address refers to.  On these machines,
     define the target hook `TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the
     information into the `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.
     When you see a `const', you will have to look inside it to find the
     `symbol_ref' in order to determine the section.  *Note Assembler
     Format::.

 -- Macro: REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P (X)
     A C expression that is nonzero if X (assumed to be a `reg' RTX) is
     valid for use as a base register.  For hard registers, it should
     always accept those which the hardware permits and reject the
     others.  Whether the macro accepts or rejects pseudo registers
     must be controlled by `REG_OK_STRICT' as described above.  This
     usually requires two variant definitions, of which `REG_OK_STRICT'
     controls the one actually used.

 -- Macro: REG_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (X, MODE)
     A C expression that is just like `REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P', except that
     that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
     MODE.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
     reference affects whether a register may be used as a base
     register.  If you define this macro, the compiler will use it
     instead of `REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P'.

 -- Macro: REG_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (X)
     A C expression that is nonzero if X (assumed to be a `reg' RTX) is
     valid for use as an index register.

     The difference between an index register and a base register is
     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
     both registers only if neither labeling works.

 -- Macro: FIND_BASE_TERM (X)
     A C expression to determine the base term of address X.  This
     macro is used in only one place: `find_base_term' in alias.c.

     It is always safe for this macro to not be defined.  It exists so
     that alias analysis can understand machine-dependent addresses.

     The typical use of this macro is to handle addresses containing a
     label_ref or symbol_ref within an UNSPEC.

 -- Macro: LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (X, OLDX, MODE, WIN)
     A C compound statement that attempts to replace X with a valid
     memory address for an operand of mode MODE.  WIN will be a C
     statement label elsewhere in the code; the macro definition may use

          GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, WIN);

     to avoid further processing if the address has become legitimate.

     X will always be the result of a call to `break_out_memory_refs',
     and OLDX will be the operand that was given to that function to
     produce X.

     The code generated by this macro should not alter the substructure
     of X.  If it transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should
     assign X (which will always be a C variable) a new value.

     It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
     address.  The compiler has standard ways of doing so in all cases.
     In fact, it is safe for this macro to do nothing.  But often a
     machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

 -- Macro: LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS (X, MODE, OPNUM, TYPE, IND_LEVELS,
          WIN)
     A C compound statement that attempts to replace X, which is an
     address that needs reloading, with a valid memory address for an
     operand of mode MODE.  WIN will be a C statement label elsewhere
     in the code.  It is not necessary to define this macro, but it
     might be useful for performance reasons.

     For example, on the i386, it is sometimes possible to use a single
     reload register instead of two by reloading a sum of two pseudo
     registers into a register.  On the other hand, for number of RISC
     processors offsets are limited so that often an intermediate
     address needs to be generated in order to address a stack slot.
     By defining `LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS' appropriately, the
     intermediate addresses generated for adjacent some stack slots can
     be made identical, and thus be shared.

     _Note_: This macro should be used with caution.  It is necessary
     to know something of how reload works in order to effectively use
     this, and it is quite easy to produce macros that build in too
     much knowledge of reload internals.

     _Note_: This macro must be able to reload an address created by a
     previous invocation of this macro.  If it fails to handle such
     addresses then the compiler may generate incorrect code or abort.

     The macro definition should use `push_reload' to indicate parts
     that need reloading; OPNUM, TYPE and IND_LEVELS are usually
     suitable to be passed unaltered to `push_reload'.

     The code generated by this macro must not alter the substructure of
     X.  If it transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should
     assign X (which will always be a C variable) a new value.  This
     also applies to parts that you change indirectly by calling
     `push_reload'.

     The macro definition may use `strict_memory_address_p' to test if
     the address has become legitimate.

     If you want to change only a part of X, one standard way of doing
     this is to use `copy_rtx'.  Note, however, that is unshares only a
     single level of rtl.  Thus, if the part to be changed is not at the
     top level, you'll need to replace first the top level.  It is not
     necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate address;
     but often a machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

 -- Macro: GO_IF_MODE_DEPENDENT_ADDRESS (ADDR, LABEL)
     A C statement or compound statement with a conditional `goto
     LABEL;' executed if memory address X (an RTX) can have different
     meanings depending on the machine mode of the memory reference it
     is used for or if the address is valid for some modes but not
     others.

     Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have
     mode-dependent effects because the amount of the increment or
     decrement is the size of the operand being addressed.  Some
     machines have other mode-dependent addresses.  Many RISC machines
     have no mode-dependent addresses.

     You may assume that ADDR is a valid address for the machine.

 -- Macro: LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P (X)
     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate constant for
     an immediate operand on the target machine.  You can assume that X
     satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need not check this.  In fact, `1'
     is a suitable definition for this macro on machines where anything
     `CONSTANT_P' is valid.

11.15 Condition Code Status
===========================

This describes the condition code status.

   The file `conditions.h' defines a variable `cc_status' to describe
how the condition code was computed (in case the interpretation of the
condition code depends on the instruction that it was set by).  This
variable contains the RTL expressions on which the condition code is
currently based, and several standard flags.

   Sometimes additional machine-specific flags must be defined in the
machine description header file.  It can also add additional
machine-specific information by defining `CC_STATUS_MDEP'.

 -- Macro: CC_STATUS_MDEP
     C code for a data type which is used for declaring the `mdep'
     component of `cc_status'.  It defaults to `int'.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

 -- Macro: CC_STATUS_MDEP_INIT
     A C expression to initialize the `mdep' field to "empty".  The
     default definition does nothing, since most machines don't use the
     field anyway.  If you want to use the field, you should probably
     define this macro to initialize it.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

 -- Macro: NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (EXP, INSN)
     A C compound statement to set the components of `cc_status'
     appropriately for an insn INSN whose body is EXP.  It is this
     macro's responsibility to recognize insns that set the condition
     code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that
     explicitly set `(cc0)'.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

     If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
     other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
     invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
     reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
     registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' can leave `cc_status' unaltered for such insns.
     But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code based
     on location `a4@(102)' and the current insn stores a new value in
     `a4'.  Although the condition code is not changed by this, it will
     no longer be true that it reflects the contents of `a4@(102)'.
     Therefore, `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must alter `cc_status' in this case
     to say that nothing is known about the condition code value.

     The definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must be prepared to deal with
     the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
     `parallel' RTXs containing various `reg', `mem' or constants which
     are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these insns is not
     sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' should do when it sees one is just to run
     `CC_STATUS_INIT'.

     A possible definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' is to call a function
     that looks at an attribute (*note Insn Attributes::) named, for
     example, `cc'.  This avoids having detailed information about
     patterns in two places, the `md' file and in `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC'.

 -- Macro: SELECT_CC_MODE (OP, X, Y)
     Returns a mode from class `MODE_CC' to be used when comparison
     operation code OP is applied to rtx X and Y.  For example, on the
     SPARC, `SELECT_CC_MODE' is defined as (see *note Jump Patterns::
     for a description of the reason for this definition)

          #define SELECT_CC_MODE(OP,X,Y) \
            (GET_MODE_CLASS (GET_MODE (X)) == MODE_FLOAT          \
             ? ((OP == EQ || OP == NE) ? CCFPmode : CCFPEmode)    \
             : ((GET_CODE (X) == PLUS || GET_CODE (X) == MINUS    \
                 || GET_CODE (X) == NEG) \
                ? CC_NOOVmode : CCmode))

     You should define this macro if and only if you define extra CC
     modes in `MACHINE-modes.def'.

 -- Macro: CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON (CODE, OP0, OP1)
     On some machines not all possible comparisons are defined, but you
     can convert an invalid comparison into a valid one.  For example,
     the Alpha does not have a `GT' comparison, but you can use an `LT'
     comparison instead and swap the order of the operands.

     On such machines, define this macro to be a C statement to do any
     required conversions.  CODE is the initial comparison code and OP0
     and OP1 are the left and right operands of the comparison,
     respectively.  You should modify CODE, OP0, and OP1 as required.

     GCC will not assume that the comparison resulting from this macro
     is valid but will see if the resulting insn matches a pattern in
     the `md' file.

     You need not define this macro if it would never change the
     comparison code or operands.

 -- Macro: REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)
     A C expression whose value is one if it is always safe to reverse a
     comparison whose mode is MODE.  If `SELECT_CC_MODE' can ever
     return MODE for a floating-point inequality comparison, then
     `REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)' must be zero.

     You need not define this macro if it would always returns zero or
     if the floating-point format is anything other than
     `IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'.  For example, here is the definition used on
     the SPARC, where floating-point inequality comparisons are always
     given `CCFPEmode':

          #define REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE(MODE)  ((MODE) != CCFPEmode)

 -- Macro: REVERSE_CONDITION (CODE, MODE)
     A C expression whose value is reversed condition code of the CODE
     for comparison done in CC_MODE MODE.  The macro is used only in
     case `REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)' is nonzero.  Define this macro in
     case machine has some non-standard way how to reverse certain
     conditionals.  For instance in case all floating point conditions
     are non-trapping, compiler may freely convert unordered compares
     to ordered one.  Then definition may look like:

          #define REVERSE_CONDITION(CODE, MODE) \
             ((MODE) != CCFPmode ? reverse_condition (CODE) \
              : reverse_condition_maybe_unordered (CODE))

 -- Macro: REVERSE_CONDEXEC_PREDICATES_P (CODE1, CODE2)
     A C expression that returns true if the conditional execution
     predicate CODE1 is the inverse of CODE2 and vice versa.  Define
     this to return 0 if the target has conditional execution
     predicates that cannot be reversed safely.  If no expansion is
     specified, this macro is defined as follows:

          #define REVERSE_CONDEXEC_PREDICATES_P (x, y) \
             ((x) == reverse_condition (y))

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FIXED_CONDITION_CODE_REGS (unsigned int *,
          unsigned int *)
     On targets which do not use `(cc0)', and which use a hard register
     rather than a pseudo-register to hold condition codes, the regular
     CSE passes are often not able to identify cases in which the hard
     register is set to a common value.  Use this hook to enable a
     small pass which optimizes such cases.  This hook should return
     true to enable this pass, and it should set the integers to which
     its arguments point to the hard register numbers used for
     condition codes.  When there is only one such register, as is true
     on most systems, the integer pointed to by the second argument
     should be set to `INVALID_REGNUM'.

     The default version of this hook returns false.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_CC_MODES_COMPATIBLE (enum
          machine_mode, enum machine_mode)
     On targets which use multiple condition code modes in class
     `MODE_CC', it is sometimes the case that a comparison can be
     validly done in more than one mode.  On such a system, define this
     target hook to take two mode arguments and to return a mode in
     which both comparisons may be validly done.  If there is no such
     mode, return `VOIDmode'.

     The default version of this hook checks whether the modes are the
     same.  If they are, it returns that mode.  If they are different,
     it returns `VOIDmode'.

11.16 Describing Relative Costs of Operations
=============================================

These macros let you describe the relative speed of various operations
on the target machine.

 -- Macro: REGISTER_MOVE_COST (MODE, FROM, TO)
     A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode MODE from a
     register in class FROM to one in class TO.  The classes are
     expressed using the enumeration values such as `GENERAL_REGS'.  A
     value of 2 is the default; other values are interpreted relative to
     that.

     It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
     same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
     registers if they are not general registers.

     If reload sees an insn consisting of a single `set' between two
     hard registers, and if `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to their
     classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that
     the constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than
     2 will allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You
     should do this if the `movM' pattern's constraints do not allow
     such copying.

 -- Macro: MEMORY_MOVE_COST (MODE, CLASS, IN)
     A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode MODE between a
     register of class CLASS and memory; IN is zero if the value is to
     be written to memory, nonzero if it is to be read in.  This cost
     is relative to those in `REGISTER_MOVE_COST'.  If moving between
     registers and memory is more expensive than between two registers,
     you should define this macro to express the relative cost.

     If you do not define this macro, GCC uses a default cost of 4 plus
     the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
     needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to
     copy between memory and a register of CLASS but the reload
     mechanism is more complex than copying via an intermediate, define
     this macro to reflect the actual cost of the move.

     GCC defines the function `memory_move_secondary_cost' if secondary
     reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to copying via a
     secondary register.  If your machine copies from memory using a
     secondary register in the conventional way but the default base
     value of 4 is not correct for your machine, define this macro to
     add some other value to the result of that function.  The
     arguments to that function are the same as to this macro.

 -- Macro: BRANCH_COST
     A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1
     is the default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

   Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative
costs, but only that certain actions are more expensive than GCC would
ordinarily expect.

 -- Macro: SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing
     less than a word of memory (i.e. a `char' or a `short') is no
     faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
     require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in
     cost between byte and (aligned) word loads.

     When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
     finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a
     fullword load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes
     accesses are faster than word accesses, using word accesses is
     preferable since it may eliminate subsequent memory access if
     subsequent accesses occur to other fields in the same word of the
     structure, but to different bytes.

 -- Macro: SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS (MODE, ALIGNMENT)
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if memory accesses described
     by the MODE and ALIGNMENT parameters have a cost many times greater
     than aligned accesses, for example if they are emulated in a trap
     handler.

     When this macro is nonzero, the compiler will act as if
     `STRICT_ALIGNMENT' were nonzero when generating code for block
     moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be
     produced.  Therefore, do not set this macro nonzero if unaligned
     accesses only add a cycle or two to the time for a memory access.

     If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.
     If this macro is defined, it should produce a nonzero value when
     `STRICT_ALIGNMENT' is nonzero.

 -- Macro: MOVE_RATIO
     The threshold of number of scalar memory-to-memory move insns,
     _below_ which a sequence of insns should be generated instead of a
     string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will
     always make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in
     increased code size.

     Note that on machines where the corresponding move insn is a
     `define_expand' that emits a sequence of insns, this macro counts
     the number of such sequences.

     If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

 -- Macro: MOVE_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     A C expression used to determine whether `move_by_pieces' will be
     used to copy a chunk of memory, or whether some other block move
     mechanism will be used.  Defaults to 1 if `move_by_pieces_ninsns'
     returns less than `MOVE_RATIO'.

 -- Macro: MOVE_MAX_PIECES
     A C expression used by `move_by_pieces' to determine the largest
     unit a load or store used to copy memory is.  Defaults to
     `MOVE_MAX'.

 -- Macro: CLEAR_RATIO
     The threshold of number of scalar move insns, _below_ which a
     sequence of insns should be generated to clear memory instead of a
     string clear insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will
     always make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in
     increased code size.

     If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

 -- Macro: CLEAR_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     A C expression used to determine whether `clear_by_pieces' will be
     used to clear a chunk of memory, or whether some other block clear
     mechanism will be used.  Defaults to 1 if `move_by_pieces_ninsns'
     returns less than `CLEAR_RATIO'.

 -- Macro: STORE_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     A C expression used to determine whether `store_by_pieces' will be
     used to set a chunk of memory to a constant value, or whether some
     other mechanism will be used.  Used by `__builtin_memset' when
     storing values other than constant zero and by `__builtin_strcpy'
     when when called with a constant source string.  Defaults to
     `MOVE_BY_PIECES_P'.

 -- Macro: USE_LOAD_POST_INCREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a load postincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_LOAD_POST_DECREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a load postdecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_LOAD_PRE_INCREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a load preincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_LOAD_PRE_DECREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a load predecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_STORE_POST_INCREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a store postincrement is
     a good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_STORE_POST_DECREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a store postdecrement is
     a good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_STORE_PRE_INCREMENT (MODE)
     This macro is used to determine whether a store preincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_STORE_PRE_DECREMENT (MODE)
     This macro is used to determine whether a store predecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'.

 -- Macro: NO_FUNCTION_CSE
     Define this macro if it is as good or better to call a constant
     function address than to call an address kept in a register.

 -- Macro: NO_RECURSIVE_FUNCTION_CSE
     Define this macro if it is as good or better for a function to call
     itself with an explicit address than to call an address kept in a
     register.

 -- Macro: RANGE_TEST_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT
     Define this macro if a non-short-circuit operation produced by
     `fold_range_test ()' is optimal.  This macro defaults to true if
     `BRANCH_COST' is greater than or equal to the value 2.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_RTX_COSTS (rtx X, int CODE, int
          OUTER_CODE, int *TOTAL)
     This target hook describes the relative costs of RTL expressions.

     The cost may depend on the precise form of the expression, which is
     available for examination in X, and the rtx code of the expression
     in which it is contained, found in OUTER_CODE.  CODE is the
     expression code--redundant, since it can be obtained with
     `GET_CODE (X)'.

     In implementing this hook, you can use the construct
     `COSTS_N_INSNS (N)' to specify a cost equal to N fast instructions.

     On entry to the hook, `*TOTAL' contains a default estimate for the
     cost of the expression.  The hook should modify this value as
     necessary.

     The hook returns true when all subexpressions of X have been
     processed, and false when `rtx_cost' should recurse.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ADDRESS_COST (rtx ADDRESS)
     This hook computes the cost of an addressing mode that contains
     ADDRESS.  If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS
     expression and the `TARGET_RTX_COST' hook.

     For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation
     of the true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC
     machines, all instructions normally have the same length and
     execution time.  Hence all addresses will have equal costs.

     In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form
     with the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the
     same, lowest, cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

     For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a
     register and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.
     When this macro is not defined, the address will be computed in a
     register and memory references will be indirect through that
     register.  On machines where the cost of the addressing mode
     containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple indirect
     reference, this will produce an additional instruction and
     possibly require an additional register.  Proper specification of
     this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

     This hook is never called with an invalid address.

     On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
     cheap as an address computation involving only one register,
     defining `TARGET_ADDRESS_COST' to reflect this can cause two
     registers to be live over a region of code where only one would
     have been if `TARGET_ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that
     manner.  This effect should be considered in the definition of
     this macro.  Equivalent costs should probably only be given to
     addresses with different numbers of registers on machines with
     lots of registers.

11.17 Adjusting the Instruction Scheduler
=========================================

The instruction scheduler may need a fair amount of machine-specific
adjustment in order to produce good code.  GCC provides several target
hooks for this purpose.  It is usually enough to define just a few of
them: try the first ones in this list first.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_ISSUE_RATE (void)
     This hook returns the maximum number of instructions that can ever
     issue at the same time on the target machine.  The default is one.
     Although the insn scheduler can define itself the possibility of
     issue an insn on the same cycle, the value can serve as an
     additional constraint to issue insns on the same simulated
     processor cycle (see hooks `TARGET_SCHED_REORDER' and
     `TARGET_SCHED_REORDER2').  This value must be constant over the
     entire compilation.  If you need it to vary depending on what the
     instructions are, you must use `TARGET_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE'.

     For the automaton based pipeline interface, you could define this
     hook to return the value of the macro `MAX_DFA_ISSUE_RATE'.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE (FILE *FILE, int
          VERBOSE, rtx INSN, int MORE)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler after it has scheduled an
     insn from the ready list.  It should return the number of insns
     which can still be issued in the current cycle.  The default is
     `MORE - 1' for insns other than `CLOBBER' and `USE', which
     normally are not counted against the issue rate.  You should
     define this hook if some insns take more machine resources than
     others, so that fewer insns can follow them in the same cycle.
     FILE is either a null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any
     debug output to.  VERBOSE is the verbose level provided by
     `-fsched-verbose-N'.  INSN is the instruction that was scheduled.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_ADJUST_COST (rtx INSN, rtx LINK, rtx
          DEP_INSN, int COST)
     This function corrects the value of COST based on the relationship
     between INSN and DEP_INSN through the dependence LINK.  It should
     return the new value.  The default is to make no adjustment to
     COST.  This can be used for example to specify to the scheduler
     using the traditional pipeline description that an output- or
     anti-dependence does not incur the same cost as a data-dependence.
     If the scheduler using the automaton based pipeline description,
     the cost of anti-dependence is zero and the cost of
     output-dependence is maximum of one and the difference of latency
     times of the first and the second insns.  If these values are not
     acceptable, you could use the hook to modify them too.  See also
     *note Automaton pipeline description::.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_ADJUST_PRIORITY (rtx INSN, int
          PRIORITY)
     This hook adjusts the integer scheduling priority PRIORITY of
     INSN.  It should return the new priority.  Reduce the priority to
     execute INSN earlier, increase the priority to execute INSN later.
     Do not define this hook if you do not need to adjust the
     scheduling priorities of insns.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_REORDER (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE, rtx
          *READY, int *N_READYP, int CLOCK)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler after it has scheduled the
     ready list, to allow the machine description to reorder it (for
     example to combine two small instructions together on `VLIW'
     machines).  FILE is either a null pointer, or a stdio stream to
     write any debug output to.  VERBOSE is the verbose level provided
     by `-fsched-verbose-N'.  READY is a pointer to the ready list of
     instructions that are ready to be scheduled.  N_READYP is a
     pointer to the number of elements in the ready list.  The scheduler
     reads the ready list in reverse order, starting with
     READY[*N_READYP-1] and going to READY[0].  CLOCK is the timer tick
     of the scheduler.  You may modify the ready list and the number of
     ready insns.  The return value is the number of insns that can
     issue this cycle; normally this is just `issue_rate'.  See also
     `TARGET_SCHED_REORDER2'.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_REORDER2 (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE,
          rtx *READY, int *N_READY, CLOCK)
     Like `TARGET_SCHED_REORDER', but called at a different time.  That
     function is called whenever the scheduler starts a new cycle.
     This one is called once per iteration over a cycle, immediately
     after `TARGET_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE'; it can reorder the ready list
     and return the number of insns to be scheduled in the same cycle.
     Defining this hook can be useful if there are frequent situations
     where scheduling one insn causes other insns to become ready in
     the same cycle.  These other insns can then be taken into account
     properly.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_DEPENDENCIES_EVALUATION_HOOK (rtx
          HEAD, rtx TAIL)
     This hook is called after evaluation forward dependencies of insns
     in chain given by two parameter values (HEAD and TAIL
     correspondingly) but before insns scheduling of the insn chain.
     For example, it can be used for better insn classification if it
     requires analysis of dependencies.  This hook can use backward and
     forward dependencies of the insn scheduler because they are already
     calculated.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE, int
          MAX_READY)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler at the beginning of each
     block of instructions that are to be scheduled.  FILE is either a
     null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any debug output to.
     VERBOSE is the verbose level provided by `-fsched-verbose-N'.
     MAX_READY is the maximum number of insns in the current scheduling
     region that can be live at the same time.  This can be used to
     allocate scratch space if it is needed, e.g. by
     `TARGET_SCHED_REORDER'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FINISH (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler at the end of each block of
     instructions that are to be scheduled.  It can be used to perform
     cleanup of any actions done by the other scheduling hooks.  FILE
     is either a null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any debug
     output to.  VERBOSE is the verbose level provided by
     `-fsched-verbose-N'.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_USE_DFA_PIPELINE_INTERFACE (void)
     This hook is called many times during insn scheduling.  If the hook
     returns nonzero, the automaton based pipeline description is used
     for insn scheduling.  Otherwise the traditional pipeline
     description is used.  The default is usage of the traditional
     pipeline description.

     You should also remember that to simplify the insn scheduler
     sources an empty traditional pipeline description interface is
     generated even if there is no a traditional pipeline description
     in the `.md' file.  The same is true for the automaton based
     pipeline description.  That means that you should be accurate in
     defining the hook.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN (void)
     The hook returns an RTL insn.  The automaton state used in the
     pipeline hazard recognizer is changed as if the insn were scheduled
     when the new simulated processor cycle starts.  Usage of the hook
     may simplify the automaton pipeline description for some VLIW
     processors.  If the hook is defined, it is used only for the
     automaton based pipeline description.  The default is not to
     change the state when the new simulated processor cycle starts.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN (void)
     The hook can be used to initialize data used by the previous hook.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_DFA_POST_CYCLE_INSN (void)
     The hook is analogous to `TARGET_SCHED_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN' but used
     to changed the state as if the insn were scheduled when the new
     simulated processor cycle finishes.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_POST_CYCLE_INSN (void)
     The hook is analogous to `TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN' but
     used to initialize data used by the previous hook.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD
          (void)
     This hook controls better choosing an insn from the ready insn
     queue for the DFA-based insn scheduler.  Usually the scheduler
     chooses the first insn from the queue.  If the hook returns a
     positive value, an additional scheduler code tries all
     permutations of `TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD
     ()' subsequent ready insns to choose an insn whose issue will
     result in maximal number of issued insns on the same cycle.  For
     the VLIW processor, the code could actually solve the problem of
     packing simple insns into the VLIW insn.  Of course, if the rules
     of VLIW packing are described in the automaton.

     This code also could be used for superscalar RISC processors.  Let
     us consider a superscalar RISC processor with 3 pipelines.  Some
     insns can be executed in pipelines A or B, some insns can be
     executed only in pipelines B or C, and one insn can be executed in
     pipeline B.  The processor may issue the 1st insn into A and the
     2nd one into B.  In this case, the 3rd insn will wait for freeing B
     until the next cycle.  If the scheduler issues the 3rd insn the
     first, the processor could issue all 3 insns per cycle.

     Actually this code demonstrates advantages of the automaton based
     pipeline hazard recognizer.  We try quickly and easy many insn
     schedules to choose the best one.

     The default is no multipass scheduling.

 -- Target Hook: int
TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD_GUARD (rtx)
     This hook controls what insns from the ready insn queue will be
     considered for the multipass insn scheduling.  If the hook returns
     zero for insn passed as the parameter, the insn will be not chosen
     to be issued.

     The default is that any ready insns can be chosen to be issued.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_DFA_NEW_CYCLE (FILE *, int, rtx, int,
          int, int *)
     This hook is called by the insn scheduler before issuing insn
     passed as the third parameter on given cycle.  If the hook returns
     nonzero, the insn is not issued on given processors cycle.
     Instead of that, the processor cycle is advanced.  If the value
     passed through the last parameter is zero, the insn ready queue is
     not sorted on the new cycle start as usually.  The first parameter
     passes file for debugging output.  The second one passes the
     scheduler verbose level of the debugging output.  The forth and
     the fifth parameter values are correspondingly processor cycle on
     which the previous insn has been issued and the current processor
     cycle.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_BUBBLES (void)
     The DFA-based scheduler could take the insertion of nop operations
     for better insn scheduling into account.  It can be done only if
     the multi-pass insn scheduling works (see hook
     `TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD').

     Let us consider a VLIW processor insn with 3 slots.  Each insn can
     be placed only in one of the three slots.  We have 3 ready insns
     A, B, and C.  A and C can be placed only in the 1st slot, B can be
     placed only in the 3rd slot.  We described the automaton which
     does not permit empty slot gaps between insns (usually such
     description is simpler).  Without this code the scheduler would
     place each insn in 3 separate VLIW insns.  If the scheduler places
     a nop insn into the 2nd slot, it could place the 3 insns into 2
     VLIW insns.  What is the nop insn is returned by hook
     `TARGET_SCHED_DFA_BUBBLE'.  Hook `TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_BUBBLES'
     can be used to initialize or create the nop insns.

     You should remember that the scheduler does not insert the nop
     insns.  It is not wise because of the following optimizations.
     The scheduler only considers such possibility to improve the
     result schedule.  The nop insns should be inserted lately, e.g. on
     the final phase.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_SCHED_DFA_BUBBLE (int INDEX)
     This hook `FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_SCHEDULING' is used to insert nop
     operations for better insn scheduling when DFA-based scheduler
     makes multipass insn scheduling (see also description of hook
     `TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_BUBBLES').  This hook returns a nop insn
     with given INDEX.  The indexes start with zero.  The hook should
     return `NULL' if there are no more nop insns with indexes greater
     than given index.

 -- Target Hook: bool IS_COSTLY_DEPENDENCE (rtx INSN1, rtx INSN2, rtx
          DEP_LINK, int DEP_COST, int DISTANCE)
     This hook is used to define which dependences are considered
     costly by the target, so costly that it is not advisable to
     schedule the insns that are involved in the dependence too close
     to one another.  The parameters to this hook are as follows:  The
     second parameter INSN2 is dependent upon the first parameter
     INSN1.  The dependence between INSN1 and INSN2 is represented by
     the third parameter DEP_LINK.  The fourth parameter COST is the
     cost of the dependence, and the fifth parameter DISTANCE is the
     distance in cycles between the two insns.  The hook returns `true'
     if considering the distance between the two insns the dependence
     between them is considered costly by the target, and `false'
     otherwise.

     Defining this hook can be useful in multiple-issue out-of-order
     machines, where (a) it's practically hopeless to predict the
     actual data/resource delays, however: (b) there's a better chance
     to predict the actual grouping that will be formed, and (c)
     correctly emulating the grouping can be very important.  In such
     targets one may want to allow issuing dependent insns closer to
     one another - i.e, closer than the dependence distance;  however,
     not in cases of "costly dependences", which this hooks allows to
     define.

   Macros in the following table are generated by the program `genattr'
and can be useful for writing the hooks.

 -- Macro: TRADITIONAL_PIPELINE_INTERFACE
     The macro definition is generated if there is a traditional
     pipeline description in `.md' file. You should also remember that
     to simplify the insn scheduler sources an empty traditional
     pipeline description interface is generated even if there is no a
     traditional pipeline description in the `.md' file.  The macro can
     be used to distinguish the two types of the traditional interface.

 -- Macro: DFA_PIPELINE_INTERFACE
     The macro definition is generated if there is an automaton pipeline
     description in `.md' file.  You should also remember that to
     simplify the insn scheduler sources an empty automaton pipeline
     description interface is generated even if there is no an automaton
     pipeline description in the `.md' file.  The macro can be used to
     distinguish the two types of the automaton interface.

 -- Macro: MAX_DFA_ISSUE_RATE
     The macro definition is generated in the automaton based pipeline
     description interface.  Its value is calculated from the automaton
     based pipeline description and is equal to maximal number of all
     insns described in constructions `define_insn_reservation' which
     can be issued on the same processor cycle.

11.18 Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, ...)
==========================================================

An object file is divided into sections containing different types of
data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the "text
section", which holds instructions and read-only data; the "data
section", which holds initialized writable data; and the "bss section",
which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other kinds of
sections.

   The compiler must tell the assembler when to switch sections.  These
macros control what commands to output to tell the assembler this.  You
can also define additional sections.

 -- Macro: TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP
     A C expression whose value is a string, including spacing,
     containing the assembler operation that should precede
     instructions and read-only data.  Normally `"\t.text"' is right.

 -- Macro: HOT_TEXT_SECTION_NAME
     If defined, a C string constant for the name of the section
     containing most frequently executed functions of the program.  If
     not defined, GCC will provide a default definition if the target
     supports named sections.

 -- Macro: UNLIKELY_EXECUTED_TEXT_SECTION_NAME
     If defined, a C string constant for the name of the section
     containing unlikely executed functions in the program.

 -- Macro: DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP
     A C expression whose value is a string, including spacing,
     containing the assembler operation to identify the following data
     as writable initialized data.  Normally `"\t.data"' is right.

 -- Macro: READONLY_DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP
     A C expression whose value is a string, including spacing,
     containing the assembler operation to identify the following data
     as read-only initialized data.

 -- Macro: READONLY_DATA_SECTION
     A macro naming a function to call to switch to the proper section
     for read-only data.  The default is to use
     `READONLY_DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP' if defined, else fall back to
     `text_section'.

     The most common definition will be `data_section', if the target
     does not have a special read-only data section, and does not put
     data in the text section.

 -- Macro: SHARED_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as shared data.  If not defined,
     `DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP' will be used.

 -- Macro: BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as uninitialized global data.  If not defined, and
     neither `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' nor `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are defined,
     uninitialized global data will be output in the data section if
     `-fno-common' is passed, otherwise `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' will be
     used.

 -- Macro: INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as initialization code.  If not defined, GCC will
     assume such a section does not exist.

 -- Macro: FINI_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as finalization code.  If not defined, GCC will
     assume such a section does not exist.

 -- Macro: CRT_CALL_STATIC_FUNCTION (SECTION_OP, FUNCTION)
     If defined, an ASM statement that switches to a different section
     via SECTION_OP, calls FUNCTION, and switches back to the text
     section.  This is used in `crtstuff.c' if `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' or
     `FINI_SECTION_ASM_OP' to calls to initialization and finalization
     functions from the init and fini sections.  By default, this macro
     uses a simple function call.  Some ports need hand-crafted
     assembly code to avoid dependencies on registers initialized in
     the function prologue or to ensure that constant pools don't end
     up too far way in the text section.

 -- Macro: FORCE_CODE_SECTION_ALIGN
     If defined, an ASM statement that aligns a code section to some
     arbitrary boundary.  This is used to force all fragments of the
     `.init' and `.fini' sections to have to same alignment and thus
     prevent the linker from having to add any padding.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_SECTIONS
     A list of names for sections other than the standard two, which are
     `in_text' and `in_data'.  You need not define this macro on a
     system with no other sections (that GCC needs to use).

 -- Macro: EXTRA_SECTION_FUNCTIONS
     One or more functions to be defined in `varasm.c'.  These
     functions should do jobs analogous to those of `text_section' and
     `data_section', for your additional sections.  Do not define this
     macro if you do not define `EXTRA_SECTIONS'.

 -- Macro: JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION
     Define this macro to be an expression with a nonzero value if jump
     tables (for `tablejump' insns) should be output in the text
     section, along with the assembler instructions.  Otherwise, the
     readonly data section is used.

     This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data
     section.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_SELECT_SECTION (tree EXP, int RELOC,
          unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT ALIGN)
     Switches to the appropriate section for output of EXP.  You can
     assume that EXP is either a `VAR_DECL' node or a constant of some
     sort.  RELOC indicates whether the initial value of EXP requires
     link-time relocations.  Bit 0 is set when variable contains local
     relocations only, while bit 1 is set for global relocations.
     Select the section by calling `data_section' or one of the
     alternatives for other sections.  ALIGN is the constant alignment
     in bits.

     The default version of this function takes care of putting
     read-only variables in `readonly_data_section'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_UNIQUE_SECTION (tree DECL, int RELOC)
     Build up a unique section name, expressed as a `STRING_CST' node,
     and assign it to `DECL_SECTION_NAME (DECL)'.  As with
     `TARGET_ASM_SELECT_SECTION', RELOC indicates whether the initial
     value of EXP requires link-time relocations.

     The default version of this function appends the symbol name to the
     ELF section name that would normally be used for the symbol.  For
     example, the function `foo' would be placed in `.text.foo'.
     Whatever the actual target object format, this is often good
     enough.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_SELECT_RTX_SECTION (enum machine_mode
          MODE, rtx X, unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT ALIGN)
     Switches to the appropriate section for output of constant pool
     entry X in MODE.  You can assume that X is some kind of constant
     in RTL.  The argument MODE is redundant except in the case of a
     `const_int' rtx.  Select the section by calling
     `readonly_data_section' or one of the alternatives for other
     sections.  ALIGN is the constant alignment in bits.

     The default version of this function takes care of putting symbolic
     constants in `flag_pic' mode in `data_section' and everything else
     in `readonly_data_section'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (tree DECL, rtx RTL,
          int NEW_DECL_P)
     Define this hook if references to a symbol or a constant must be
     treated differently depending on something about the variable or
     function named by the symbol (such as what section it is in).

     The hook is executed immediately after rtl has been created for
     DECL, which may be a variable or function declaration or an entry
     in the constant pool.  In either case, RTL is the rtl in question.
     Do _not_ use `DECL_RTL (DECL)' in this hook; that field may not
     have been initialized yet.

     In the case of a constant, it is safe to assume that the rtl is a
     `mem' whose address is a `symbol_ref'.  Most decls will also have
     this form, but that is not guaranteed.  Global register variables,
     for instance, will have a `reg' for their rtl.  (Normally the
     right thing to do with such unusual rtl is leave it alone.)

     The NEW_DECL_P argument will be true if this is the first time
     that `TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' has been invoked on this decl.
     It will be false for subsequent invocations, which will happen for
     duplicate declarations.  Whether or not anything must be done for
     the duplicate declaration depends on whether the hook examines
     `DECL_ATTRIBUTES'.  NEW_DECL_P is always true when the hook is
     called for a constant.

     The usual thing for this hook to do is to record flags in the
     `symbol_ref', using `SYMBOL_REF_FLAG' or `SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS'.
     Historically, the name string was modified if it was necessary to
     encode more than one bit of information, but this practice is now
     discouraged; use `SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS'.

     The default definition of this hook, `default_encode_section_info'
     in `varasm.c', sets a number of commonly-useful bits in
     `SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS'.  Check whether the default does what you need
     before overriding it.

 -- Target Hook: const char *TARGET_STRIP_NAME_ENCODING (const char
          *name)
     Decode NAME and return the real name part, sans the characters
     that `TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' may have added.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_IN_SMALL_DATA_P (tree EXP)
     Returns true if EXP should be placed into a "small data" section.
     The default version of this hook always returns false.

 -- Variable: Target Hook bool TARGET_HAVE_SRODATA_SECTION
     Contains the value true if the target places read-only "small
     data" into a separate section.  The default value is false.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_BINDS_LOCAL_P (tree EXP)
     Returns true if EXP names an object for which name resolution
     rules must resolve to the current "module" (dynamic shared library
     or executable image).

     The default version of this hook implements the name resolution
     rules for ELF, which has a looser model of global name binding
     than other currently supported object file formats.

 -- Variable: Target Hook bool TARGET_HAVE_TLS
     Contains the value true if the target supports thread-local
     storage.  The default value is false.

11.19 Position Independent Code
===============================

This section describes macros that help implement generation of position
independent code.  Simply defining these macros is not enough to
generate valid PIC; you must also add support to the macros
`GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS', as well as
`LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS'.  You must modify the definition of `movsi' to do
something appropriate when the source operand contains a symbolic
address.  You may also need to alter the handling of switch statements
so that they use relative addresses.

 -- Macro: PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM
     The register number of the register used to address a table of
     static data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is
     defined by a processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).
     When this macro is defined, RTL is generated for this register
     once, as with the stack pointer and frame pointer registers.  If
     this macro is not defined, it is up to the machine-dependent files
     to allocate such a register (if necessary).  Note that this
     register must be fixed when in use (e.g.  when `flag_pic' is true).

 -- Macro: PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED
     Define this macro if the register defined by
     `PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is clobbered by calls.  Do not define
     this macro if `PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is not defined.

 -- Macro: FINALIZE_PIC
     By generating position-independent code, when two different
     programs (A and B) share a common library (libC.a), the text of
     the library can be shared whether or not the library is linked at
     the same address for both programs.  In some of these
     environments, position-independent code requires not only the use
     of different addressing modes, but also special code to enable the
     use of these addressing modes.

     The `FINALIZE_PIC' macro serves as a hook to emit these special
     codes once the function is being compiled into assembly code, but
     not before.  (It is not done before, because in the case of
     compiling an inline function, it would lead to multiple PIC
     prologues being included in functions which used inline functions
     and were compiled to assembly language.)

 -- Macro: LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (X)
     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate immediate
     operand on the target machine when generating position independent
     code.  You can assume that X satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need
     not check this.  You can also assume FLAG_PIC is true, so you need
     not check it either.  You need not define this macro if all
     constants (including `SYMBOL_REF') can be immediate operands when
     generating position independent code.

File: gccint.info,  Node: File Framework,  Next: Data Output,  Up: Assembler Format

11.20.1 The Overall Framework of an Assembler File
--------------------------------------------------

This describes the overall framework of an assembly file.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FILE_START ()
     Output to `asm_out_file' any text which the assembler expects to
     find at the beginning of a file.  The default behavior is
     controlled by two flags, documented below.  Unless your target's
     assembler is quite unusual, if you override the default, you
     should call `default_file_start' at some point in your target
     hook.  This lets other target files rely on these variables.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_FILE_START_APP_OFF
     If this flag is true, the text of the macro `ASM_APP_OFF' will be
     printed as the very first line in the assembly file, unless
     `-fverbose-asm' is in effect.  (If that macro has been defined to
     the empty string, this variable has no effect.)  With the normal
     definition of `ASM_APP_OFF', the effect is to notify the GNU
     assembler that it need not bother stripping comments or extra
     whitespace from its input.  This allows it to work a bit faster.

     The default is false.  You should not set it to true unless you
     have verified that your port does not generate any extra
     whitespace or comments that will cause GAS to issue errors in
     NO_APP mode.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_FILE_START_FILE_DIRECTIVE
     If this flag is true, `output_file_directive' will be called for
     the primary source file, immediately after printing `ASM_APP_OFF'
     (if that is enabled).  Most ELF assemblers expect this to be done.
     The default is false.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FILE_END ()
     Output to `asm_out_file' any text which the assembler expects to
     find at the end of a file.  The default is to output nothing.

 -- Function: void file_end_indicate_exec_stack ()
     Some systems use a common convention, the `.note.GNU-stack'
     special section, to indicate whether or not an object file relies
     on the stack being executable.  If your system uses this
     convention, you should define `TARGET_ASM_FILE_END' to this
     function.  If you need to do other things in that hook, have your
     hook function call this function.

 -- Macro: ASM_COMMENT_START
     A C string constant describing how to begin a comment in the target
     assembler language.  The compiler assumes that the comment will
     end at the end of the line.

 -- Macro: ASM_APP_ON
     A C string constant for text to be output before each `asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     `"#APP"', which is a comment that has no effect on most assemblers
     but tells the GNU assembler that it must check the lines that
     follow for all valid assembler constructs.

 -- Macro: ASM_APP_OFF
     A C string constant for text to be output after each `asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     `"#NO_APP"', which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
     time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler
     output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement to output COFF information or DWARF debugging
     information which indicates that filename NAME is the current
     source file to the stdio stream STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     the file format in use is appropriate.

 -- Macro: OUTPUT_QUOTED_STRING (STREAM, STRING)
     A C statement to output the string STRING to the stdio stream
     STREAM.  If you do not call the function `output_quoted_string' in
     your config files, GCC will only call it to output filenames to
     the assembler source.  So you can use it to canonicalize the format
     of the filename using this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (STREAM, LINE, COUNTER)
     A C statement to output DBX or SDB debugging information before
     code for line number LINE of the current source file to the stdio
     stream STREAM. COUNTER is the number of time the macro was
     invoked, including the current invocation; it is intended to
     generate unique labels in the assembly output.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of debugging
     information for the debugger in use is appropriate.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT (STREAM, STRING)
     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to handle a
     `#ident' directive containing the text STRING.  If this macro is
     not defined, nothing is output for a `#ident' directive.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION (const char *NAME,
          unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned int ALIGN)
     Output assembly directives to switch to section NAME.  The section
     should have attributes as specified by FLAGS, which is a bit mask
     of the `SECTION_*' flags defined in `output.h'.  If ALIGN is
     nonzero, it contains an alignment in bytes to be used for the
     section, otherwise some target default should be used.  Only
     targets that must specify an alignment within the section
     directive need pay attention to ALIGN - we will still use
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAVE_NAMED_SECTIONS
     This flag is true if the target supports
     `TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION'.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int TARGET_SECTION_TYPE_FLAGS (tree DECL,
          const char *NAME, int RELOC)
     Choose a set of section attributes for use by
     `TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION' based on a variable or function decl, a
     section name, and whether or not the declaration's initializer may
     contain runtime relocations.  DECL may be  null, in which case
     read-write data should be assumed.

     The default version if this function handles choosing code vs data,
     read-only vs read-write data, and `flag_pic'.  You should only
     need to override this if your target has special flags that might
     be set via `__attribute__'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Data Output,  Next: Uninitialized Data,  Prev: File Framework,  Up: Assembler Format

11.20.2 Output of Data
----------------------

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_BYTE_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_HI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_SI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_DI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_TI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_UNALIGNED_HI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_UNALIGNED_SI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_UNALIGNED_DI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_UNALIGNED_TI_OP
     These hooks specify assembly directives for creating certain kinds
     of integer object.  The `TARGET_ASM_BYTE_OP' directive creates a
     byte-sized object, the `TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_HI_OP' one creates an
     aligned two-byte object, and so on.  Any of the hooks may be
     `NULL', indicating that no suitable directive is available.

     The compiler will print these strings at the start of a new line,
     followed immediately by the object's initial value.  In most cases,
     the string should contain a tab, a pseudo-op, and then another tab.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_INTEGER (rtx X, unsigned int SIZE, int
          ALIGNED_P)
     The `assemble_integer' function uses this hook to output an
     integer object.  X is the object's value, SIZE is its size in
     bytes and ALIGNED_P indicates whether it is aligned.  The function
     should return `true' if it was able to output the object.  If it
     returns false, `assemble_integer' will try to split the object
     into smaller parts.

     The default implementation of this hook will use the
     `TARGET_ASM_BYTE_OP' family of strings, returning `false' when the
     relevant string is `NULL'.

 -- Macro: OUTPUT_ADDR_CONST_EXTRA (STREAM, X, FAIL)
     A C statement to recognize RTX patterns that `output_addr_const'
     can't deal with, and output assembly code to STREAM corresponding
     to the pattern X.  This may be used to allow machine-dependent
     `UNSPEC's to appear within constants.

     If `OUTPUT_ADDR_CONST_EXTRA' fails to recognize a pattern, it must
     `goto fail', so that a standard error message is printed.  If it
     prints an error message itself, by calling, for example,
     `output_operand_lossage', it may just complete normally.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (STREAM, PTR, LEN)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a string constant containing the LEN bytes
     at PTR.  PTR will be a C expression of type `char *' and LEN a C
     expression of type `int'.

     If the assembler has a `.ascii' pseudo-op as found in the Berkeley
     Unix assembler, do not define the macro `ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_FDESC (STREAM, DECL, N)
     A C statement to output word N of a function descriptor for DECL.
     This must be defined if `TARGET_VTABLE_USES_DESCRIPTORS' is
     defined, and is otherwise unused.

 -- Macro: CONSTANT_POOL_BEFORE_FUNCTION
     You may define this macro as a C expression.  You should define the
     expression to have a nonzero value if GCC should output the
     constant pool for a function before the code for the function, or
     a zero value if GCC should output the constant pool after the
     function.  If you do not define this macro, the usual case, GCC
     will output the constant pool before the function.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (FILE, FUNNAME, FUNDECL, SIZE)
     A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of
     the constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the
     name of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, it can be obtained via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that will be written immediately after
     this call.

     If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro
     need not be defined.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (FILE, X, MODE, ALIGN,
          LABELNO, JUMPTO)
     A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in
     the constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro
     need not do anything for RTL expressions that can be output
     normally.)

     The argument FILE is the standard I/O stream to output the
     assembler code on.  X is the RTL expression for the constant to
     output, and MODE is the machine mode (in case X is a `const_int').
     ALIGN is the required alignment for the value X; you should
     output an assembler directive to force this much alignment.

     The argument LABELNO is a number to use in an internal label for
     the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
     responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper
     place.  Here is how to do this:

          `(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)' (FILE, "LC", LABELNO);

     When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
     `goto' to the label JUMPTO.  This will prevent the same pool entry
     from being output a second time in the usual manner.

     You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_EPILOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)
     A C statement to output assembler commands to at the end of the
     constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the name
     of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, you can obtain it via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that GCC wrote immediately before this
     call.

     If no constant-pool epilogue is required, the usual case, you need
     not define this macro.

 -- Macro: IS_ASM_LOGICAL_LINE_SEPARATOR (C)
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if C is used
     as a logical line separator by the assembler.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is that only the
     character `;' is treated as a logical line separator.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_OPEN_PAREN
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_CLOSE_PAREN
     These target hooks are C string constants, describing the syntax
     in the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  If not
     overridden, they default to normal parentheses, which is correct
     for most assemblers.

   These macros are provided by `real.h' for writing the definitions of
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE' and the like:

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE (X, L)
 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE (X, L)
 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_LONG_DOUBLE (X, L)
     These translate X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to the target's
     floating point representation, and store its bit pattern in the
     variable L.  For `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE', this variable
     should be a simple `long int'.  For the others, it should be an
     array of `long int'.  The number of elements in this array is
     determined by the size of the desired target floating point data
     type: 32 bits of it go in each `long int' array element.  Each
     array element holds 32 bits of the result, even if `long int' is
     wider than 32 bits on the host machine.

     The array element values are designed so that you can print them
     out using `fprintf' in the order they should appear in the target
     machine's memory.

11.20.3 Output of Uninitialized Variables
-----------------------------------------

Each of the macros in this section is used to do the whole job of
outputting a single uninitialized variable.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a common-label named NAME whose
     size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size rounded up
     to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     common global variables are output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE,
          ALIGNMENT)
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' except that DECL of the variable
     to be output, if there is one, or `NULL_TREE' if there is no
     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GCC will use it
     in place of both `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' and
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON'.  Define this macro when you need to
     see the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', except that it
     is used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON'
     will be used.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of uninitialized global DECL named
     NAME whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Try to use function `asm_output_bss' defined in `varasm.c' when
     defining this macro.  If unable, use the expression `assemble_name
     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
     output the additional assembler syntax for defining the name, and
     a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     global variables are output.  This macro exists to properly
     support languages like C++ which do not have `common' data.
     However, this macro currently is not defined for all targets.  If
     this macro and `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are not defined then
     `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' or `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' or
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON' is used.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

     Try to use function `asm_output_aligned_bss' defined in file
     `varasm.c' when defining this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS', except that it is
     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' will
     be used.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a local-common-label named NAME
     whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     static variables are output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_LOCAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE,
          ALIGNMENT)
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL' except that DECL of the variable to
     be output, if there is one, or `NULL_TREE' if there is no
     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GCC will use it
     in place of both `ASM_OUTPUT_DECL' and `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL'.
     Define this macro when you need to see the variable's decl in
     order to chose what to output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', except that it is
     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' will
     be used.

11.20.4 Output and Generation of Labels
---------------------------------------

This is about outputting labels.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a label named NAME.  Use the
     expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name
     itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler
     syntax for defining the name, and a newline.  A default definition
     of this macro is provided which is correct for most systems.

 -- Macro: SIZE_ASM_OP
     A C string containing the appropriate assembler directive to
     specify the size of a symbol, without any arguments.  On systems
     that use ELF, the default (in `config/elfos.h') is `"\t.size\t"';
     on other systems, the default is not to define this macro.

     Define this macro only if it is correct to use the default
     definitions of `ASM_OUTPUT_SIZE_DIRECTIVE' and
     `ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE' for your system.  If you need your own
     custom definitions of those macros, or if you do not need explicit
     symbol sizes at all, do not define this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SIZE_DIRECTIVE (STREAM, NAME, SIZE)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM a directive telling the assembler that the size of the
     symbol NAME is SIZE.  SIZE is a `HOST_WIDE_INT'.  If you define
     `SIZE_ASM_OP', a default definition of this macro is provided.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM a directive telling the assembler to calculate the size of
     the symbol NAME by subtracting its address from the current
     address.

     If you define `SIZE_ASM_OP', a default definition of this macro is
     provided.  The default assumes that the assembler recognizes a
     special `.' symbol as referring to the current address, and can
     calculate the difference between this and another symbol.  If your
     assembler does not recognize `.' or cannot do calculations with
     it, you will need to redefine `ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE' to use
     some other technique.

 -- Macro: TYPE_ASM_OP
     A C string containing the appropriate assembler directive to
     specify the type of a symbol, without any arguments.  On systems
     that use ELF, the default (in `config/elfos.h') is `"\t.type\t"';
     on other systems, the default is not to define this macro.

     Define this macro only if it is correct to use the default
     definition of `ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' for your system.  If you
     need your own custom definition of this macro, or if you do not
     need explicit symbol types at all, do not define this macro.

 -- Macro: TYPE_OPERAND_FMT
     A C string which specifies (using `printf' syntax) the format of
     the second operand to `TYPE_ASM_OP'.  On systems that use ELF, the
     default (in `config/elfos.h') is `"@%s"'; on other systems, the
     default is not to define this macro.

     Define this macro only if it is correct to use the default
     definition of `ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' for your system.  If you
     need your own custom definition of this macro, or if you do not
     need explicit symbol types at all, do not define this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE (STREAM, TYPE)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM a directive telling the assembler that the type of the
     symbol NAME is TYPE.  TYPE is a C string; currently, that string
     is always either `"function"' or `"object"', but you should not
     count on this.

     If you define `TYPE_ASM_OP' and `TYPE_OPERAND_FMT', a default
     definition of this macro is provided.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of a
     function which is being defined.  This macro is responsible for
     outputting the label definition (perhaps using
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL'
     tree node representing the function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

     You may wish to use `ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' in the definition
     of this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE (STREAM, NAME, DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the size of a function
     which is being defined.  The argument NAME is the name of the
     function.  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL' tree node
     representing the function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function size is not
     defined.

     You may wish to use `ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE' in the definition
     of this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_OBJECT_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of an
     initialized variable which is being defined.  This macro must
     output the label definition (perhaps using `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').
     The argument DECL is the `VAR_DECL' tree node representing the
     variable.

     If this macro is not defined, then the variable name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

     You may wish to use `ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' and/or
     `ASM_OUTPUT_SIZE_DIRECTIVE' in the definition of this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_CONSTANT_NAME (STREAM, NAME, EXP, SIZE)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of a
     constant which is being defined.  This macro is responsible for
     outputting the label definition (perhaps using
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').  The argument EXP is the value of the
     constant, and SIZE is the size of the constant in bytes.  NAME
     will be an internal label.

     If this macro is not defined, then the NAME is defined in the
     usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

     You may wish to use `ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' in the definition
     of this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_REGISTER_GLOBAL (STREAM, DECL, REGNO, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for claiming a register REGNO for a
     global variable DECL with name NAME.

     If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it
     to do nothing.

 -- Macro: ASM_FINISH_DECLARE_OBJECT (STREAM, DECL, TOPLEVEL, ATEND)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to finish up declaring a variable
     name once the compiler has processed its initializer fully and
     thus has had a chance to determine the size of an array when
     controlled by an initializer.  This is used on systems where it's
     necessary to declare something about the size of the object.

     If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it
     to do nothing.

     You may wish to use `ASM_OUTPUT_SIZE_DIRECTIVE' and/or
     `ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE' in the definition of this macro.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (FILE *STREAM, const
          char *NAME)
     This target hook is a function to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME global; that
     is, available for reference from other files.

     The default implementation relies on a proper definition of
     `GLOBAL_ASM_OP'.

 -- Macro: ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME weak; that is,
     available for reference from other files but only used if no other
     definition is available.  Use the expression `assemble_name
     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
     output the additional assembler syntax for making that name weak,
     and a newline.

     If you don't define this macro or `ASM_WEAKEN_DECL', GCC will not
     support weak symbols and you should not define the `SUPPORTS_WEAK'
     macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_WEAKEN_DECL (STREAM, DECL, NAME, VALUE)
     Combines (and replaces) the function of `ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' and
     `ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS', allowing access to the associated function
     or variable decl.  If VALUE is not `NULL', this C statement should
     output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code which defines
     (equates) the weak symbol NAME to have the value VALUE.  If VALUE
     is `NULL', it should output commands to make NAME weak.

 -- Macro: SUPPORTS_WEAK
     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports weak
     symbols.

     If you don't define this macro, `defaults.h' provides a default
     definition.  If either `ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' or `ASM_WEAKEN_DECL' is
     defined, the default definition is `1'; otherwise, it is `0'.
     Define this macro if you want to control weak symbol support with
     a compiler flag such as `-melf'.

 -- Macro: MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY (DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to mark DECL to be emitted as a
     public symbol such that extra copies in multiple translation units
     will be discarded by the linker.  Define this macro if your object
     file format provides support for this concept, such as the `COMDAT'
     section flags in the Microsoft Windows PE/COFF format, and this
     support requires changes to DECL, such as putting it in a separate
     section.

 -- Macro: SUPPORTS_ONE_ONLY
     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports
     one-only semantics.

     If you don't define this macro, `varasm.c' provides a default
     definition.  If `MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY' is defined, the default
     definition is `1'; otherwise, it is `0'.  Define this macro if you
     want to control one-only symbol support with a compiler flag, or if
     setting the `DECL_ONE_ONLY' flag is enough to mark a declaration to
     be emitted as one-only.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_ASSEMBLE_VISIBILITY (tree DECL, const
          char *VISIBILITY)
     This target hook is a function to output to ASM_OUT_FILE some
     commands that will make the symbol(s) associated with DECL have
     hidden, protected or internal visibility as specified by
     VISIBILITY.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name of an external
     symbol named NAME which is referenced in this compilation but not
     defined.  The value of DECL is the tree node for the declaration.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
     require anything.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EXTERNAL_LIBCALL (rtx SYMREF)
     This target hook is a function to output to ASM_OUT_FILE an
     assembler pseudo-op to declare a library function name external.
     The name of the library function is given by SYMREF, which is a
     `symbol_ref'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM a reference in assembler syntax to a label named NAME.
     This should add `_' to the front of the name, if that is customary
     on your operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix systems.
     This macro is used in `assemble_name'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SYMBOL_REF (STREAM, SYM)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output a reference to
     `SYMBOL_REF' SYM.  If not defined, `assemble_name' will be used to
     output the name of the symbol.  This macro may be used to modify
     the way a symbol is referenced depending on information encoded by
     `TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL_REF (STREAM, BUF)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output a reference to BUF, the
     result of `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL'.  If not defined,
     `assemble_name' will be used to output the name of the symbol.
     This macro is not used by `output_asm_label', or the `%l'
     specifier that calls it; the intention is that this macro should
     be set when it is necessary to output a label differently when its
     address is being taken.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_INTERNAL_LABEL (FILE *STREAM, const
          char *PREFIX, unsigned long LABELNO)
     A function to output to the stdio stream STREAM a label whose name
     is made from the string PREFIX and the number LABELNO.

     It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the
     labels used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise,
     certain programs will have name conflicts with internal labels.

     It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table
     of the object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for
     labels that should be excluded; on many systems, the letter `L' at
     the beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
     convention your system uses, and follow it.

     The default version of this function utilizes
     ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DEBUG_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM a debug info
     label whose name is made from the string PREFIX and the number
     NUM.  This is useful for VLIW targets, where debug info labels may
     need to be treated differently than branch target labels.  On some
     systems, branch target labels must be at the beginning of
     instruction bundles, but debug info labels can occur in the middle
     of instruction bundles.

     If this macro is not defined, then
     `(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)' will be used.

 -- Macro: ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (STRING, PREFIX, NUM)
     A C statement to store into the string STRING a label whose name
     is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.

     This string, when output subsequently by `assemble_name', should
     produce the output that `(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)' would
     produce with the same PREFIX and NUM.

     If the string begins with `*', then `assemble_name' will output
     the rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
     `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' to use `*' in this way.  If the
     string doesn't start with `*', then `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' gets to
     output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' is also part of your machine description, so
     you should know what it does on your machine.)

 -- Macro: ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (OUTVAR, NAME, NUMBER)
     A C expression to assign to OUTVAR (which is a variable of type
     `char *') a newly allocated string made from the string NAME and
     the number NUMBER, with some suitable punctuation added.  Use
     `alloca' to get space for the string.

     The string will be used as an argument to `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to
     produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose
     name is NAME.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in
     valid assembler code.  The argument NUMBER is different each time
     this macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between
     similarly-named internal static variables in different scopes.

     Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent
     any conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow
     periods or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least
     one of these between the name and the number will suffice.

     If this macro is not defined, a default definition will be provided
     which is correct for most systems.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DEF (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol NAME to have the value VALUE.

     If `SET_ASM_OP' is defined, a default definition is provided which
     is correct for most systems.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DEF_FROM_DECLS (STREAM, DECL_OF_NAME,
          DECL_OF_VALUE)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol whose tree node is DECL_OF_NAME
     to have the value of the tree node DECL_OF_VALUE.  This macro will
     be used in preference to `ASM_OUTPUT_DEF' if it is defined and if
     the tree nodes are available.

     If `SET_ASM_OP' is defined, a default definition is provided which
     is correct for most systems.

 -- Macro: TARGET_DEFERRED_OUTPUT_DEFS (DECL_OF_NAME, DECL_OF_VALUE)
     A C statement that evaluates to true if the assembler code which
     defines (equates) the symbol whose tree node is DECL_OF_NAME to
     have the value of the tree node DECL_OF_VALUE should be emitted
     near the end of the current compilation unit.  The default is to
     not defer output of defines.  This macro affects defines output by
     `ASM_OUTPUT_DEF' and `ASM_OUTPUT_DEF_FROM_DECLS'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the weak symbol NAME to have the value
     VALUE.  If VALUE is `NULL', it defines NAME as an undefined weak
     symbol.

     Define this macro if the target only supports weak aliases; define
     `ASM_OUTPUT_DEF' instead if possible.

 -- Macro: OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (BUF, IS_INST, CLASS_NAME, CAT_NAME,
          SEL_NAME)
     Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
     Objective-C methods.

     The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of
     the class (e.g. `_1_Foo').  For methods in categories, the name of
     the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g.
     `_1_Foo_Bar').

     These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult
     since the method's selector is not present in the name.
     Therefore, particular systems define other ways of computing names.

     BUF is an expression of type `char *' which gives you a buffer in
     which to store the name; its length is as long as CLASS_NAME,
     CAT_NAME and SEL_NAME put together, plus 50 characters extra.

     The argument IS_INST specifies whether the method is an instance
     method or a class method; CLASS_NAME is the name of the class;
     CAT_NAME is the name of the category (or `NULL' if the method is
     not in a category); and SEL_NAME is the name of the selector.

     On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can
     use this macro to provide more human-readable names.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_CLASS_REFERENCE (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM commands to declare that the label NAME is an Objective-C
     class reference.  This is only needed for targets whose linkers
     have special support for NeXT-style runtimes.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_UNRESOLVED_REFERENCE (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM commands to declare that the label NAME is an unresolved
     Objective-C class reference.  This is only needed for targets
     whose linkers have special support for NeXT-style runtimes.

11.20.5 How Initialization Functions Are Handled
------------------------------------------------

The compiled code for certain languages includes "constructors" (also
called "initialization routines")--functions to initialize data in the
program when the program is started.  These functions need to be called
before the program is "started"--that is to say, before `main' is
called.

   Compiling some languages generates "destructors" (also called
"termination routines") that should be called when the program
terminates.

   To make the initialization and termination functions work, the
compiler must output something in the assembler code to cause those
functions to be called at the appropriate time.  When you port the
compiler to a new system, you need to specify how to do this.

   There are two major ways that GCC currently supports the execution of
initialization and termination functions.  Each way has two variants.
Much of the structure is common to all four variations.

   The linker must build two lists of these functions--a list of
initialization functions, called `__CTOR_LIST__', and a list of
termination functions, called `__DTOR_LIST__'.

   Each list always begins with an ignored function pointer (which may
hold 0, -1, or a count of the function pointers after it, depending on
the environment).  This is followed by a series of zero or more function
pointers to constructors (or destructors), followed by a function
pointer containing zero.

   Depending on the operating system and its executable file format,
either `crtstuff.c' or `libgcc2.c' traverses these lists at startup
time and exit time.  Constructors are called in reverse order of the
list; destructors in forward order.

   The best way to handle static constructors works only for object file
formats which provide arbitrarily-named sections.  A section is set
aside for a list of constructors, and another for a list of destructors.
Traditionally these are called `.ctors' and `.dtors'.  Each object file
that defines an initialization function also puts a word in the
constructor section to point to that function.  The linker accumulates
all these words into one contiguous `.ctors' section.  Termination
functions are handled similarly.

   This method will be chosen as the default by `target-def.h' if
`TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION' is defined.  A target that does not support
arbitrary sections, but does support special designated constructor and
destructor sections may define `CTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP' and
`DTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP' to achieve the same effect.

   When arbitrary sections are available, there are two variants,
depending upon how the code in `crtstuff.c' is called.  On systems that
support a ".init" section which is executed at program startup, parts
of `crtstuff.c' are compiled into that section.  The program is linked
by the `gcc' driver like this:

     ld -o OUTPUT_FILE crti.o crtbegin.o ... -lgcc crtend.o crtn.o

   The prologue of a function (`__init') appears in the `.init' section
of `crti.o'; the epilogue appears in `crtn.o'.  Likewise for the
function `__fini' in the ".fini" section.  Normally these files are
provided by the operating system or by the GNU C library, but are
provided by GCC for a few targets.

   The objects `crtbegin.o' and `crtend.o' are (for most targets)
compiled from `crtstuff.c'.  They contain, among other things, code
fragments within the `.init' and `.fini' sections that branch to
routines in the `.text' section.  The linker will pull all parts of a
section together, which results in a complete `__init' function that
invokes the routines we need at startup.

   To use this variant, you must define the `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' macro
properly.

   If no init section is available, when GCC compiles any function
called `main' (or more accurately, any function designated as a program
entry point by the language front end calling `expand_main_function'),
it inserts a procedure call to `__main' as the first executable code
after the function prologue.  The `__main' function is defined in
`libgcc2.c' and runs the global constructors.

   In file formats that don't support arbitrary sections, there are
again two variants.  In the simplest variant, the GNU linker (GNU `ld')
and an `a.out' format must be used.  In this case,
`TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR' is defined to produce a `.stabs' entry of type
`N_SETT', referencing the name `__CTOR_LIST__', and with the address of
the void function containing the initialization code as its value.  The
GNU linker recognizes this as a request to add the value to a "set";
the values are accumulated, and are eventually placed in the executable
as a vector in the format described above, with a leading (ignored)
count and a trailing zero element.  `TARGET_ASM_DESTRUCTOR' is handled
similarly.  Since no init section is available, the absence of
`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' causes the compilation of `main' to call `__main'
as above, starting the initialization process.

   The last variant uses neither arbitrary sections nor the GNU linker.
This is preferable when you want to do dynamic linking and when using
file formats which the GNU linker does not support, such as `ECOFF'.  In
this case, `TARGET_HAVE_CTORS_DTORS' is false, initialization and
termination functions are recognized simply by their names.  This
requires an extra program in the linkage step, called `collect2'.  This
program pretends to be the linker, for use with GCC; it does its job by
running the ordinary linker, but also arranges to include the vectors of
initialization and termination functions.  These functions are called
via `__main' as described above.  In order to use this method,
`use_collect2' must be defined in the target in `config.gcc'.

   The following section describes the specific macros that control and
customize the handling of initialization and termination functions.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Macros for Initialization,  Next: Instruction Output,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Assembler Format

11.20.6 Macros Controlling Initialization Routines
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the macros that control how the compiler handles initialization
and termination functions:

 -- Macro: INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C string constant, including spacing, for the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     initialization code.  If not defined, GCC will assume such a
     section does not exist.  When you are using special sections for
     initialization and termination functions, this macro also controls
     how `crtstuff.c' and `libgcc2.c' arrange to run the initialization
     functions.

 -- Macro: HAS_INIT_SECTION
     If defined, `main' will not call `__main' as described above.
     This macro should be defined for systems that control start-up code
     on a symbol-by-symbol basis, such as OSF/1, and should not be
     defined explicitly for systems that support `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.

 -- Macro: LD_INIT_SWITCH
     If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker
     that the following symbol is an initialization routine.

 -- Macro: LD_FINI_SWITCH
     If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker
     that the following symbol is a finalization routine.

 -- Macro: COLLECT_SHARED_INIT_FUNC (STREAM, FUNC)
     If defined, a C statement that will write a function that can be
     automatically called when a shared library is loaded.  The function
     should call FUNC, which takes no arguments.  If not defined, and
     the object format requires an explicit initialization function,
     then a function called `_GLOBAL__DI' will be generated.

     This function and the following one are used by collect2 when
     linking a shared library that needs constructors or destructors,
     or has DWARF2 exception tables embedded in the code.

 -- Macro: COLLECT_SHARED_FINI_FUNC (STREAM, FUNC)
     If defined, a C statement that will write a function that can be
     automatically called when a shared library is unloaded.  The
     function should call FUNC, which takes no arguments.  If not
     defined, and the object format requires an explicit finalization
     function, then a function called `_GLOBAL__DD' will be generated.

 -- Macro: INVOKE__main
     If defined, `main' will call `__main' despite the presence of
     `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.  This macro should be defined for systems
     where the init section is not actually run automatically, but is
     still useful for collecting the lists of constructors and
     destructors.

 -- Macro: SUPPORTS_INIT_PRIORITY
     If nonzero, the C++ `init_priority' attribute is supported and the
     compiler should emit instructions to control the order of
     initialization of objects.  If zero, the compiler will issue an
     error message upon encountering an `init_priority' attribute.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAVE_CTORS_DTORS
     This value is true if the target supports some "native" method of
     collecting constructors and destructors to be run at startup and
     exit.  It is false if we must use `collect2'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR (rtx SYMBOL, int PRIORITY)
     If defined, a function that outputs assembler code to arrange to
     call the function referenced by SYMBOL at initialization time.

     Assume that SYMBOL is a `SYMBOL_REF' for a function taking no
     arguments and with no return value.  If the target supports
     initialization priorities, PRIORITY is a value between 0 and
     `MAX_INIT_PRIORITY'; otherwise it must be `DEFAULT_INIT_PRIORITY'.

     If this macro is not defined by the target, a suitable default will
     be chosen if (1) the target supports arbitrary section names, (2)
     the target defines `CTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP', or (3) `USE_COLLECT2'
     is not defined.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_DESTRUCTOR (rtx SYMBOL, int PRIORITY)
     This is like `TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR' but used for termination
     functions rather than initialization functions.

   If `TARGET_HAVE_CTORS_DTORS' is true, the initialization routine
generated for the generated object file will have static linkage.

   If your system uses `collect2' as the means of processing
constructors, then that program normally uses `nm' to scan an object
file for constructor functions to be called.

   On certain kinds of systems, you can define this macro to make
`collect2' work faster (and, in some cases, make it work at all):

 -- Macro: OBJECT_FORMAT_COFF
     Define this macro if the system uses COFF (Common Object File
     Format) object files, so that `collect2' can assume this format
     and scan object files directly for dynamic constructor/destructor
     functions.

     This macro is effective only in a native compiler; `collect2' as
     part of a cross compiler always uses `nm' for the target machine.

 -- Macro: COLLECT_PARSE_FLAG (FLAG)
     Define this macro to be C code that examines `collect2' command
     line option FLAG and performs special actions if `collect2' needs
     to behave differently depending on FLAG.

 -- Macro: REAL_NM_FILE_NAME
     Define this macro as a C string constant containing the file name
     to use to execute `nm'.  The default is to search the path
     normally for `nm'.

     If your system supports shared libraries and has a program to list
     the dynamic dependencies of a given library or executable, you can
     define these macros to enable support for running initialization
     and termination functions in shared libraries:

 -- Macro: LDD_SUFFIX
     Define this macro to a C string constant containing the name of
     the program which lists dynamic dependencies, like `"ldd"' under
     SunOS 4.

 -- Macro: PARSE_LDD_OUTPUT (PTR)
     Define this macro to be C code that extracts filenames from the
     output of the program denoted by `LDD_SUFFIX'.  PTR is a variable
     of type `char *' that points to the beginning of a line of output
     from `LDD_SUFFIX'.  If the line lists a dynamic dependency, the
     code must advance PTR to the beginning of the filename on that
     line.  Otherwise, it must set PTR to `NULL'.

11.20.7 Output of Assembler Instructions
----------------------------------------

This describes assembler instruction output.

 -- Macro: REGISTER_NAMES
     A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
     registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what
     translates register numbers in the compiler into assembler
     language.

 -- Macro: ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES
     If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing
     a name and a register number.  This macro defines additional names
     for hard registers, thus allowing the `asm' option in declarations
     to refer to registers using alternate names.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (STREAM, PTR)
     Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
     requires different names for the machine instructions.

     The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
     assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream STREAM.  The
     macro-operand PTR is a variable of type `char *' which points to
     the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is written
     in the machine description.  The definition should output the
     opcode name to STREAM, performing any translation you desire, and
     increment the variable PTR to point at the end of the opcode so
     that it will not be output twice.

     In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire
     opcode name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to
     process text that includes `%'-sequences to substitute operands,
     you must take care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to
     increment PTR over whatever text should not be output normally.

     If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
     elements of `recog_data.operand'.

     If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output in
     the usual way.

 -- Macro: FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (INSN, OPVEC, NOPERANDS)
     If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output
     of assembler code for INSN, to modify the extracted operands so
     they will be output differently.

     Here the argument OPVEC is the vector containing the operands
     extracted from INSN, and NOPERANDS is the number of elements of
     the vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.  The
     contents of this vector are what will be used to convert the insn
     template into assembler code, so you can change the assembler
     output by changing the contents of the vector.

     This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
     file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently,
     you can cause a large class of instructions to be output
     differently (such as with rearranged operands).  Naturally,
     variations in assembler syntax affecting individual insn patterns
     ought to be handled by writing conditional output routines in
     those patterns.

     If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.

 -- Macro: PRINT_OPERAND (STREAM, X, CODE)
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
     assembler syntax for an instruction operand X.  X is an RTL
     expression.

     CODE is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways of
     printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
     printed differently depending on the context.  CODE comes from the
     `%' specification that was used to request printing of the
     operand.  If the specification was just `%DIGIT' then CODE is 0;
     if the specification was `%LTR DIGIT' then CODE is the ASCII code
     for LTR.

     If X is a register, this macro should print the register's name.
     The names can be found in an array `reg_names' whose type is `char
     *[]'.  `reg_names' is initialized from `REGISTER_NAMES'.

     When the machine description has a specification `%PUNCT' (a `%'
     followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called with a
     null pointer for X and the punctuation character for CODE.

 -- Macro: PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P (CODE)
     A C expression which evaluates to true if CODE is a valid
     punctuation character for use in the `PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  If
     `PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' is not defined, it means that no
     punctuation characters (except for the standard one, `%') are used
     in this way.

 -- Macro: PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (STREAM, X)
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
     assembler syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory
     reference whose address is X.  X is an RTL expression.

     On some machines, the syntax for a symbolic address depends on the
     section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
     hook `TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information into the
     `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  *Note Assembler
     Format::.

 -- Macro: DBR_OUTPUT_SEQEND (FILE)
     A C statement, to be executed after all slot-filler instructions
     have been output.  If necessary, call `dbr_sequence_length' to
     determine the number of slots filled in a sequence (zero if not
     currently outputting a sequence), to decide how many no-ops to
     output, or whatever.

     Don't define this macro if it has nothing to do, but it is helpful
     in reading assembly output if the extent of the delay sequence is
     made explicit (e.g. with white space).

   Note that output routines for instructions with delay slots must be
prepared to deal with not being output as part of a sequence (i.e. when
the scheduling pass is not run, or when no slot fillers could be
found.)  The variable `final_sequence' is null when not processing a
sequence, otherwise it contains the `sequence' rtx being output.

 -- Macro: REGISTER_PREFIX
 -- Macro: LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX
 -- Macro: USER_LABEL_PREFIX
 -- Macro: IMMEDIATE_PREFIX
     If defined, C string expressions to be used for the `%R', `%L',
     `%U', and `%I' options of `asm_fprintf' (see `final.c').  These
     are useful when a single `md' file must support multiple assembler
     formats.  In that case, the various `tm.h' files can define these
     macros differently.

 -- Macro: ASM_FPRINTF_EXTENSIONS (FILE, ARGPTR, FORMAT)
     If defined this macro should expand to a series of `case'
     statements which will be parsed inside the `switch' statement of
     the `asm_fprintf' function.  This allows targets to define extra
     printf formats which may useful when generating their assembler
     statements.  Note that uppercase letters are reserved for future
     generic extensions to asm_fprintf, and so are not available to
     target specific code.  The output file is given by the parameter
     FILE.  The varargs input pointer is ARGPTR and the rest of the
     format string, starting the character after the one that is being
     switched upon, is pointed to by FORMAT.

 -- Macro: ASSEMBLER_DIALECT
     If your target supports multiple dialects of assembler language
     (such as different opcodes), define this macro as a C expression
     that gives the numeric index of the assembler language dialect to
     use, with zero as the first variant.

     If this macro is defined, you may use constructs of the form
          `{option0|option1|option2...}'
     in the output templates of patterns (*note Output Template::) or
     in the first argument of `asm_fprintf'.  This construct outputs
     `option0', `option1', `option2', etc., if the value of
     `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' is zero, one, two, etc.  Any special characters
     within these strings retain their usual meaning.  If there are
     fewer alternatives within the braces than the value of
     `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT', the construct outputs nothing.

     If you do not define this macro, the characters `{', `|' and `}'
     do not have any special meaning when used in templates or operands
     to `asm_fprintf'.

     Define the macros `REGISTER_PREFIX', `LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX',
     `USER_LABEL_PREFIX' and `IMMEDIATE_PREFIX' if you can express the
     variations in assembler language syntax with that mechanism.
     Define `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' and use the `{option0|option1}' syntax
     if the syntax variant are larger and involve such things as
     different opcodes or operand order.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_REG_PUSH (STREAM, REGNO)
     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
     push hard register number REGNO onto the stack.  The code need not
     be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_REG_POP (STREAM, REGNO)
     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
     pop hard register number REGNO off of the stack.  The code need
     not be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.

11.20.8 Output of Dispatch Tables
---------------------------------

This concerns dispatch tables.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_DIFF_ELT (STREAM, BODY, VALUE, REL)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     pseudo-instruction to generate a difference between two labels.
     VALUE and REL are the numbers of two internal labels.  The
     definitions of these labels are output using
     `(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)', and they must be printed in
     the same way here.  For example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d-L%d\n",
                   VALUE, REL)

     You must provide this macro on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are relative to the table's own address.  If
     defined, GCC will also use this macro on all machines when
     producing PIC.  BODY is the body of the `ADDR_DIFF_VEC'; it is
     provided so that the mode and flags can be read.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_VEC_ELT (STREAM, VALUE)
     This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are absolute.

     The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio
     stream STREAM an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a
     reference to a label.  VALUE is the number of an internal label
     whose definition is output using
     `(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)'.  For example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d\n", VALUE)

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM, TABLE)
     Define this if the label before a jump-table needs to be output
     specially.  The first three arguments are the same as for
     `(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)'; the fourth argument is the
     jump-table which follows (a `jump_insn' containing an `addr_vec'
     or `addr_diff_vec').

     This feature is used on system V to output a `swbeg' statement for
     the table.

     If this macro is not defined, these labels are output with
     `(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_END (STREAM, NUM, TABLE)
     Define this if something special must be output at the end of a
     jump-table.  The definition should be a C statement to be executed
     after the assembler code for the table is written.  It should write
     the appropriate code to stdio stream STREAM.  The argument TABLE
     is the jump-table insn, and NUM is the label-number of the
     preceding label.

     If this macro is not defined, nothing special is output at the end
     of the jump-table.

11.20.9 Assembler Commands for Exception Regions
------------------------------------------------

This describes commands marking the start and the end of an exception
region.

 -- Macro: EH_FRAME_SECTION_NAME
     If defined, a C string constant for the name of the section
     containing exception handling frame unwind information.  If not
     defined, GCC will provide a default definition if the target
     supports named sections.  `crtstuff.c' uses this macro to switch
     to the appropriate section.

     You should define this symbol if your target supports DWARF 2 frame
     unwind information and the default definition does not work.

 -- Macro: EH_FRAME_IN_DATA_SECTION
     If defined, DWARF 2 frame unwind information will be placed in the
     data section even though the target supports named sections.  This
     might be necessary, for instance, if the system linker does garbage
     collection and sections cannot be marked as not to be collected.

     Do not define this macro unless `TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION' is also
     defined.

 -- Macro: MASK_RETURN_ADDR
     An rtx used to mask the return address found via
     `RETURN_ADDR_RTX', so that it does not contain any extraneous set
     bits in it.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO
     Define this macro to 0 if your target supports DWARF 2 frame unwind
     information, but it does not yet work with exception handling.
     Otherwise, if your target supports this information (if it defines
     `INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX' and either `UNALIGNED_INT_ASM_OP' or
     `OBJECT_FORMAT_ELF'), GCC will provide a default definition of 1.

     If this macro is defined to 1, the DWARF 2 unwinder will be the
     default exception handling mechanism; otherwise,
     `setjmp'/`longjmp' will be used by default.

     If this macro is defined to anything, the DWARF 2 unwinder will be
     used instead of inline unwinders and `__unwind_function' in the
     non-`setjmp' case.

 -- Macro: MUST_USE_SJLJ_EXCEPTIONS
     This macro need only be defined if `DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO' is
     runtime-variable.  In that case, `except.h' cannot correctly
     determine the corresponding definition of
     `MUST_USE_SJLJ_EXCEPTIONS', so the target must provide it directly.

 -- Macro: DWARF_CIE_DATA_ALIGNMENT
     This macro need only be defined if the target might save registers
     in the function prologue at an offset to the stack pointer that is
     not aligned to `UNITS_PER_WORD'.  The definition should be the
     negative minimum alignment if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined,
     and the positive minimum alignment otherwise.  *Note SDB and
     DWARF::.  Only applicable if the target supports DWARF 2 frame
     unwind information.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EXCEPTION_SECTION ()
     If defined, a function that switches to the section in which the
     main exception table is to be placed (*note Sections::).  The
     default is a function that switches to a section named
     `.gcc_except_table' on machines that support named sections via
     `TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION', otherwise if `-fpic' or `-fPIC' is in
     effect, the `data_section', otherwise the `readonly_data_section'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EH_FRAME_SECTION ()
     If defined, a function that switches to the section in which the
     DWARF 2 frame unwind information to be placed (*note Sections::).
     The default is a function that outputs a standard GAS section
     directive, if `EH_FRAME_SECTION_NAME' is defined, or else a data
     section directive followed by a synthetic label.

 -- Variable: Target Hook bool TARGET_TERMINATE_DW2_EH_FRAME_INFO
     Contains the value true if the target should add a zero word onto
     the end of a Dwarf-2 frame info section when used for exception
     handling.  Default value is false if `EH_FRAME_SECTION_NAME' is
     defined, and true otherwise.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_DWARF_REGISTER_SPAN (rtx REG)
     Given a register, this hook should return a parallel of registers
     to represent where to find the register pieces.  Define this hook
     if the register and its mode are represented in Dwarf in
     non-contiguous locations, or if the register should be represented
     in more than one register in Dwarf.  Otherwise, this hook should
     return `NULL_RTX'.  If not defined, the default is to return
     `NULL_RTX'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Alignment Output,  Prev: Exception Region Output,  Up: Assembler Format

11.20.10 Assembler Commands for Alignment
-----------------------------------------

This describes commands for alignment.

 -- Macro: JUMP_ALIGN (LABEL)
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which is a
     common destination of jumps and has no fallthru incoming edge.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable ALIGN_JUMPS in the target's
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the user's
     selection in ALIGN_JUMPS in a `JUMP_ALIGN' implementation.

 -- Macro: LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER (LABEL)
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which follows
     a `BARRIER'.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

 -- Macro: LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER_MAX_SKIP
     The maximum number of bytes to skip when applying
     `LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER'.  This works only if
     `ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

 -- Macro: LOOP_ALIGN (LABEL)
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which follows
     a `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG' note.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable `align_loops' in the target's
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the user's
     selection in `align_loops' in a `LOOP_ALIGN' implementation.

 -- Macro: LOOP_ALIGN_MAX_SKIP
     The maximum number of bytes to skip when applying `LOOP_ALIGN'.
     This works only if `ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

 -- Macro: LABEL_ALIGN (LABEL)
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL.  If
     `LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER' / `LOOP_ALIGN' specify a different
     alignment, the maximum of the specified values is used.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable `align_labels' in the target's
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the user's
     selection in `align_labels' in a `LABEL_ALIGN' implementation.

 -- Macro: LABEL_ALIGN_MAX_SKIP
     The maximum number of bytes to skip when applying `LABEL_ALIGN'.
     This works only if `ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP (STREAM, NBYTES)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to advance the location counter by NBYTES bytes.
     Those bytes should be zero when loaded.  NBYTES will be a C
     expression of type `int'.

 -- Macro: ASM_NO_SKIP_IN_TEXT
     Define this macro if `ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP' should not be used in the
     text section because it fails to put zeros in the bytes that are
     skipped.  This is true on many Unix systems, where the pseudo-op
     to skip bytes produces no-op instructions rather than zeros when
     used in the text section.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
     POWER bytes.  POWER will be a C expression of type `int'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN_WITH_NOP (STREAM, POWER)
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN', except that the "nop" instruction is used
     for padding, if necessary.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER, MAX_SKIP)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
     POWER bytes, but only if MAX_SKIP or fewer bytes are needed to
     satisfy the alignment request.  POWER and MAX_SKIP will be a C
     expression of type `int'.

File: gccint.info,  Node: All Debuggers,  Next: DBX Options,  Up: Debugging Info

11.21.1 Macros Affecting All Debugging Formats
----------------------------------------------

These macros affect all debugging formats.

 -- Macro: DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (REGNO)
     A C expression that returns the DBX register number for the
     compiler register number REGNO.  In the default macro provided,
     the value of this expression will be REGNO itself.  But sometimes
     there are some registers that the compiler knows about and DBX
     does not, or vice versa.  In such cases, some register may need to
     have one number in the compiler and another for DBX.

     If two registers have consecutive numbers inside GCC, and they can
     be used as a pair to hold a multiword value, then they _must_ have
     consecutive numbers after renumbering with `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER'.
     Otherwise, debuggers will be unable to access such a pair, because
     they expect register pairs to be consecutive in their own
     numbering scheme.

     If you find yourself defining `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER' in way that
     does not preserve register pairs, then what you must do instead is
     redefine the actual register numbering scheme.

 -- Macro: DEBUGGER_AUTO_OFFSET (X)
     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
     automatic variable having address X (an RTL expression).  The
     default computation assumes that X is based on the frame-pointer
     and gives the offset from the frame-pointer.  This is required for
     targets that produce debugging output for DBX or COFF-style
     debugging output for SDB and allow the frame-pointer to be
     eliminated when the `-g' options is used.

 -- Macro: DEBUGGER_ARG_OFFSET (OFFSET, X)
     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
     argument having address X (an RTL expression).  The nominal offset
     is OFFSET.

 -- Macro: PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE
     A C expression that returns the type of debugging output GCC should
     produce when the user specifies just `-g'.  Define this if you
     have arranged for GCC to support more than one format of debugging
     output.  Currently, the allowable values are `DBX_DEBUG',
     `SDB_DEBUG', `DWARF_DEBUG', `DWARF2_DEBUG', `XCOFF_DEBUG',
     `VMS_DEBUG', and `VMS_AND_DWARF2_DEBUG'.

     When the user specifies `-ggdb', GCC normally also uses the value
     of this macro to select the debugging output format, but with two
     exceptions.  If `DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO' is defined, GCC uses the
     value `DWARF2_DEBUG'.  Otherwise, if `DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO' is
     defined, GCC uses `DBX_DEBUG'.

     The value of this macro only affects the default debugging output;
     the user can always get a specific type of output by using
     `-gstabs', `-gcoff', `-gdwarf-2', `-gxcoff', or `-gvms'.

11.21.2 Specific Options for DBX Output
---------------------------------------

These are specific options for DBX output.

 -- Macro: DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce debugging output for DBX
     in response to the `-g' option.

 -- Macro: XCOFF_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce XCOFF format debugging
     output in response to the `-g' option.  This is a variant of DBX
     format.

 -- Macro: DEFAULT_GDB_EXTENSIONS
     Define this macro to control whether GCC should by default generate
     GDB's extended version of DBX debugging information (assuming
     DBX-format debugging information is enabled at all).  If you don't
     define the macro, the default is 1: always generate the extended
     information if there is any occasion to.

 -- Macro: DEBUG_SYMS_TEXT
     Define this macro if all `.stabs' commands should be output while
     in the text section.

 -- Macro: ASM_STABS_OP
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler
     pseudo op to use instead of `"\t.stabs\t"' to define an ordinary
     debugging symbol.  If you don't define this macro, `"\t.stabs\t"'
     is used.  This macro applies only to DBX debugging information
     format.

 -- Macro: ASM_STABD_OP
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler
     pseudo op to use instead of `"\t.stabd\t"' to define a debugging
     symbol whose value is the current location.  If you don't define
     this macro, `"\t.stabd\t"' is used.  This macro applies only to
     DBX debugging information format.

 -- Macro: ASM_STABN_OP
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler
     pseudo op to use instead of `"\t.stabn\t"' to define a debugging
     symbol with no name.  If you don't define this macro,
     `"\t.stabn\t"' is used.  This macro applies only to DBX debugging
     information format.

 -- Macro: DBX_NO_XREFS
     Define this macro if DBX on your system does not support the
     construct `xsTAGNAME'.  On some systems, this construct is used to
     describe a forward reference to a structure named TAGNAME.  On
     other systems, this construct is not supported at all.

 -- Macro: DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH
     A symbol name in DBX-format debugging information is normally
     continued (split into two separate `.stabs' directives) when it
     exceeds a certain length (by default, 80 characters).  On some
     operating systems, DBX requires this splitting; on others,
     splitting must not be done.  You can inhibit splitting by defining
     this macro with the value zero.  You can override the default
     splitting-length by defining this macro as an expression for the
     length you desire.

 -- Macro: DBX_CONTIN_CHAR
     Normally continuation is indicated by adding a `\' character to
     the end of a `.stabs' string when a continuation follows.  To use
     a different character instead, define this macro as a character
     constant for the character you want to use.  Do not define this
     macro if backslash is correct for your system.

 -- Macro: DBX_STATIC_STAB_DATA_SECTION
     Define this macro if it is necessary to go to the data section
     before outputting the `.stabs' pseudo-op for a non-global static
     variable.

 -- Macro: DBX_TYPE_DECL_STABS_CODE
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a typedef.  The default is `N_LSYM'.

 -- Macro: DBX_STATIC_CONST_VAR_CODE
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a static variable located in the text section.  DBX format does not
     provide any "right" way to do this.  The default is `N_FUN'.

 -- Macro: DBX_REGPARM_STABS_CODE
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not provide any
     "right" way to do this.  The default is `N_RSYM'.

 -- Macro: DBX_REGPARM_STABS_LETTER
     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
     parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not customarily
     provide any way to do this.  The default is `'P''.

 -- Macro: DBX_MEMPARM_STABS_LETTER
     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
     stack parameter.  The default is `'p''.

 -- Macro: DBX_FUNCTION_FIRST
     Define this macro if the DBX information for a function and its
     arguments should precede the assembler code for the function.
     Normally, in DBX format, the debugging information entirely
     follows the assembler code.

 -- Macro: DBX_BLOCKS_FUNCTION_RELATIVE
     Define this macro if the value of a symbol describing the scope of
     a block (`N_LBRAC' or `N_RBRAC') should be relative to the start
     of the enclosing function.  Normally, GCC uses an absolute address.

 -- Macro: DBX_USE_BINCL
     Define this macro if GCC should generate `N_BINCL' and `N_EINCL'
     stabs for included header files, as on Sun systems.  This macro
     also directs GCC to output a type number as a pair of a file
     number and a type number within the file.  Normally, GCC does not
     generate `N_BINCL' or `N_EINCL' stabs, and it outputs a single
     number for a type number.

11.21.3 Open-Ended Hooks for DBX Format
---------------------------------------

These are hooks for DBX format.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC (STREAM, NAME)
     Define this macro to say how to output to STREAM the debugging
     information for the start of a scope level for variable names.  The
     argument NAME is the name of an assembler symbol (for use with
     `assemble_name') whose value is the address where the scope begins.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_RBRAC (STREAM, NAME)
     Like `DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC', but for the end of a scope level.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_NFUN (STREAM, LSCOPE_LABEL, DECL)
     Define this macro if the target machine requires special handling
     to output an `N_FUN' entry for the function DECL.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_END (STREAM, FUNCTION)
     Define this macro if the target machine requires special output at
     the end of the debugging information for a function.  The
     definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to output the
     appropriate information to STREAM.  FUNCTION is the
     `FUNCTION_DECL' node for the function.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES (SYMS)
     Define this macro if you need to control the order of output of the
     standard data types at the beginning of compilation.  The argument
     SYMS is a `tree' which is a chain of all the predefined global
     symbols, including names of data types.

     Normally, DBX output starts with definitions of the types for
     integers and characters, followed by all the other predefined
     types of the particular language in no particular order.

     On some machines, it is necessary to output different particular
     types first.  To do this, define `DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES' to
     output those symbols in the necessary order.  Any predefined types
     that you don't explicitly output will be output afterward in no
     particular order.

     Be careful not to define this macro so that it works only for C.
     There are no global variables to access most of the built-in
     types, because another language may have another set of types.
     The way to output a particular type is to look through SYMS to see
     if you can find it.  Here is an example:

          {
            tree decl;
            for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
              if (!strcmp (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (DECL_NAME (decl)),
                           "long int"))
                dbxout_symbol (decl);
            ...
          }

     This does nothing if the expected type does not exist.

     See the function `init_decl_processing' in `c-decl.c' to find the
     names to use for all the built-in C types.

     Here is another way of finding a particular type:

          {
            tree decl;
            for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
              if (TREE_CODE (decl) == TYPE_DECL
                  && (TREE_CODE (TREE_TYPE (decl))
                      == INTEGER_CST)
                  && TYPE_PRECISION (TREE_TYPE (decl)) == 16
                  && TYPE_UNSIGNED (TREE_TYPE (decl)))
                /* This must be `unsigned short'.  */
                dbxout_symbol (decl);
            ...
          }

 -- Macro: NO_DBX_FUNCTION_END
     Some stabs encapsulation formats (in particular ECOFF), cannot
     handle the `.stabs "",N_FUN,,0,0,Lscope-function-1' gdb dbx
     extension construct.  On those machines, define this macro to turn
     this feature off without disturbing the rest of the gdb extensions.

11.21.4 File Names in DBX Format
--------------------------------

This describes file names in DBX format.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM which indicates that file NAME is the main source
     file--the file specified as the input file for compilation.  This
     macro is called only once, at the beginning of compilation.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM which indicates that the current directory during
     compilation is named NAME.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information at the end of
     compilation of the main source file NAME.

     If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output at the
     end of compilation, which is correct for most machines.

11.21.5 Macros for SDB and DWARF Output
---------------------------------------

Here are macros for SDB and DWARF output.

 -- Macro: SDB_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce COFF-style debugging output
     for SDB in response to the `-g' option.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce dwarf version 2 format
     debugging output in response to the `-g' option.

     To support optional call frame debugging information, you must also
     define `INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX' and either set
     `RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P' on the prologue insns if you use RTL for the
     prologue, or call `dwarf2out_def_cfa' and `dwarf2out_reg_save' as
     appropriate from `TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' if you don't.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_FRAME_INFO
     Define this macro to a nonzero value if GCC should always output
     Dwarf 2 frame information.  If `DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO' (*note
     Exception Region Output:: is nonzero, GCC will output this
     information not matter how you define `DWARF2_FRAME_INFO'.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_GENERATE_TEXT_SECTION_LABEL
     By default, the Dwarf 2 debugging information generator will
     generate a label to mark the beginning of the text section.  If it
     is better simply to use the name of the text section itself,
     rather than an explicit label, to indicate the beginning of the
     text section, define this macro to zero.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_ASM_LINE_DEBUG_INFO
     Define this macro to be a nonzero value if the assembler can
     generate Dwarf 2 line debug info sections.  This will result in
     much more compact line number tables, and hence is desirable if it
     works.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_DELTA (STREAM, SIZE, LABEL1, LABEL2)
     A C statement to issue assembly directives that create a difference
     between the two given labels, using an integer of the given size.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_OFFSET (STREAM, SIZE, LABEL)
     A C statement to issue assembly directives that create a
     section-relative reference to the given label, using an integer of
     the given size.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_PCREL (STREAM, SIZE, LABEL)
     A C statement to issue assembly directives that create a
     self-relative reference to the given label, using an integer of
     the given size.

 -- Macro: PUT_SDB_...
     Define these macros to override the assembler syntax for the
     special SDB assembler directives.  See `sdbout.c' for a list of
     these macros and their arguments.  If the standard syntax is used,
     you need not define them yourself.

 -- Macro: SDB_DELIM
     Some assemblers do not support a semicolon as a delimiter, even
     between SDB assembler directives.  In that case, define this macro
     to be the delimiter to use (usually `\n').  It is not necessary to
     define a new set of `PUT_SDB_OP' macros if this is the only change
     required.

 -- Macro: SDB_GENERATE_FAKE
     Define this macro to override the usual method of constructing a
     dummy name for anonymous structure and union types.  See
     `sdbout.c' for more information.

 -- Macro: SDB_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_REFERENCES
     Define this macro to allow references to unknown structure, union,
     or enumeration tags to be emitted.  Standard COFF does not allow
     handling of unknown references, MIPS ECOFF has support for it.

 -- Macro: SDB_ALLOW_FORWARD_REFERENCES
     Define this macro to allow references to structure, union, or
     enumeration tags that have not yet been seen to be handled.  Some
     assemblers choke if forward tags are used, while some require it.

11.21.6 Macros for VMS Debug Format
-----------------------------------

Here are macros for VMS debug format.

 -- Macro: VMS_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce debugging output for VMS
     in response to the `-g' option.  The default behavior for VMS is
     to generate minimal debug info for a traceback in the absence of
     `-g' unless explicitly overridden with `-g0'.  This behavior is
     controlled by `OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS' and `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Floating Point,  Next: Mode Switching,  Prev: Debugging Info,  Up: Target Macros

11.22 Cross Compilation and Floating Point
==========================================

While all modern machines use twos-complement representation for
integers, there are a variety of representations for floating point
numbers.  This means that in a cross-compiler the representation of
floating point numbers in the compiled program may be different from
that used in the machine doing the compilation.

   Because different representation systems may offer different amounts
of range and precision, all floating point constants must be
represented in the target machine's format.  Therefore, the cross
compiler cannot safely use the host machine's floating point
arithmetic; it must emulate the target's arithmetic.  To ensure
consistency, GCC always uses emulation to work with floating point
values, even when the host and target floating point formats are
identical.

   The following macros are provided by `real.h' for the compiler to
use.  All parts of the compiler which generate or optimize
floating-point calculations must use these macros.  They may evaluate
their operands more than once, so operands must not have side effects.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE
     The C data type to be used to hold a floating point value in the
     target machine's format.  Typically this is a `struct' containing
     an array of `HOST_WIDE_INT', but all code should treat it as an
     opaque quantity.

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X, REAL_VALUE_TYPE Y)
     Compares for equality the two values, X and Y.  If the target
     floating point format supports negative zeroes and/or NaNs,
     `REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (-0.0, 0.0)' is true, and `REAL_VALUES_EQUAL
     (NaN, NaN)' is false.

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUES_LESS (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X, REAL_VALUE_TYPE Y)
     Tests whether X is less than Y.

 -- Macro: HOST_WIDE_INT REAL_VALUE_FIX (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Truncates X to a signed integer, rounding toward zero.

 -- Macro: unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_FIX
          (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Truncates X to an unsigned integer, rounding toward zero.  If X is
     negative, returns zero.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE REAL_VALUE_ATOF (const char *STRING, enum
          machine_mode MODE)
     Converts STRING into a floating point number in the target
     machine's representation for mode MODE.  This routine can handle
     both decimal and hexadecimal floating point constants, using the
     syntax defined by the C language for both.

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUE_NEGATIVE (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Returns 1 if X is negative (including negative zero), 0 otherwise.

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUE_ISINF (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Determines whether X represents infinity (positive or negative).

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUE_ISNAN (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Determines whether X represents a "NaN" (not-a-number).

 -- Macro: void REAL_ARITHMETIC (REAL_VALUE_TYPE OUTPUT, enum tree_code
          CODE, REAL_VALUE_TYPE X, REAL_VALUE_TYPE Y)
     Calculates an arithmetic operation on the two floating point values
     X and Y, storing the result in OUTPUT (which must be a variable).

     The operation to be performed is specified by CODE.  Only the
     following codes are supported: `PLUS_EXPR', `MINUS_EXPR',
     `MULT_EXPR', `RDIV_EXPR', `MAX_EXPR', `MIN_EXPR'.

     If `REAL_ARITHMETIC' is asked to evaluate division by zero and the
     target's floating point format cannot represent infinity, it will
     call `abort'.  Callers should check for this situation first, using
     `MODE_HAS_INFINITIES'.  *Note Storage Layout::.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE REAL_VALUE_NEGATE (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Returns the negative of the floating point value X.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE REAL_VALUE_ABS (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Returns the absolute value of X.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE REAL_VALUE_TRUNCATE (REAL_VALUE_TYPE MODE,
          enum machine_mode X)
     Truncates the floating point value X to fit in MODE.  The return
     value is still a full-size `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', but it has an
     appropriate bit pattern to be output asa floating constant whose
     precision accords with mode MODE.

 -- Macro: void REAL_VALUE_TO_INT (HOST_WIDE_INT LOW, HOST_WIDE_INT
          HIGH, REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Converts a floating point value X into a double-precision integer
     which is then stored into LOW and HIGH.  If the value is not
     integral, it is truncated.

 -- Macro: void REAL_VALUE_FROM_INT (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X, HOST_WIDE_INT
          LOW, HOST_WIDE_INT HIGH, enum machine_mode MODE)
     Converts a double-precision integer found in LOW and HIGH, into a
     floating point value which is then stored into X.  The value is
     truncated to fit in mode MODE.

11.23 Mode Switching Instructions
=================================

The following macros control mode switching optimizations:

 -- Macro: OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING (ENTITY)
     Define this macro if the port needs extra instructions inserted
     for mode switching in an optimizing compilation.

     For an example, the SH4 can perform both single and double
     precision floating point operations, but to perform a single
     precision operation, the FPSCR PR bit has to be cleared, while for
     a double precision operation, this bit has to be set.  Changing
     the PR bit requires a general purpose register as a scratch
     register, hence these FPSCR sets have to be inserted before
     reload, i.e. you can't put this into instruction emitting or
     `TARGET_MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG'.

     You can have multiple entities that are mode-switched, and select
     at run time which entities actually need it.
     `OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING' should return nonzero for any ENTITY
     that needs mode-switching.  If you define this macro, you also
     have to define `NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING', `MODE_NEEDED',
     `MODE_PRIORITY_TO_MODE' and `EMIT_MODE_SET'.  `MODE_AFTER',
     `MODE_ENTRY', and `MODE_EXIT' are optional.

 -- Macro: NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING
     If you define `OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING', you have to define this as
     initializer for an array of integers.  Each initializer element N
     refers to an entity that needs mode switching, and specifies the
     number of different modes that might need to be set for this
     entity.  The position of the initializer in the initializer -
     starting counting at zero - determines the integer that is used to
     refer to the mode-switched entity in question.  In macros that
     take mode arguments / yield a mode result, modes are represented
     as numbers 0 ... N - 1.  N is used to specify that no mode switch
     is needed / supplied.

 -- Macro: MODE_NEEDED (ENTITY, INSN)
     ENTITY is an integer specifying a mode-switched entity.  If
     `OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING' is defined, you must define this macro to
     return an integer value not larger than the corresponding element
     in `NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING', to denote the mode that ENTITY
     must be switched into prior to the execution of INSN.

 -- Macro: MODE_AFTER (MODE, INSN)
     If this macro is defined, it is evaluated for every INSN during
     mode switching. It determines the mode that an insn results in (if
     different from the incoming mode).

 -- Macro: MODE_ENTRY (ENTITY)
     If this macro is defined, it is evaluated for every ENTITY that
     needs mode switching. It should evaluate to an integer, which is a
     mode that ENTITY is assumed to be switched to at function entry.
     If `MODE_ENTRY' is defined then `MODE_EXIT' must be defined.

 -- Macro: MODE_EXIT (ENTITY)
     If this macro is defined, it is evaluated for every ENTITY that
     needs mode switching. It should evaluate to an integer, which is a
     mode that ENTITY is assumed to be switched to at function exit. If
     `MODE_EXIT' is defined then `MODE_ENTRY' must be defined.

 -- Macro: MODE_PRIORITY_TO_MODE (ENTITY, N)
     This macro specifies the order in which modes for ENTITY are
     processed.  0 is the highest priority,
     `NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING[ENTITY] - 1' the lowest.  The value
     of the macro should be an integer designating a mode for ENTITY.
     For any fixed ENTITY, `mode_priority_to_mode' (ENTITY, N) shall be
     a bijection in 0 ...  `num_modes_for_mode_switching[ENTITY] - 1'.

 -- Macro: EMIT_MODE_SET (ENTITY, MODE, HARD_REGS_LIVE)
     Generate one or more insns to set ENTITY to MODE.  HARD_REG_LIVE
     is the set of hard registers live at the point where the insn(s)
     are to be inserted.

11.24 Defining target-specific uses of `__attribute__'
======================================================

Target-specific attributes may be defined for functions, data and types.
These are described using the following target hooks; they also need to
be documented in `extend.texi'.

 -- Target Hook: const struct attribute_spec * TARGET_ATTRIBUTE_TABLE
     If defined, this target hook points to an array of `struct
     attribute_spec' (defined in `tree.h') specifying the machine
     specific attributes for this target and some of the restrictions
     on the entities to which these attributes are applied and the
     arguments they take.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (tree TYPE1, tree
          TYPE2)
     If defined, this target hook is a function which returns zero if
     the attributes on TYPE1 and TYPE2 are incompatible, one if they
     are compatible, and two if they are nearly compatible (which
     causes a warning to be generated).  If this is not defined,
     machine-specific attributes are supposed always to be compatible.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SET_DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (tree TYPE)
     If defined, this target hook is a function which assigns default
     attributes to newly defined TYPE.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_MERGE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (tree TYPE1, tree
          TYPE2)
     Define this target hook if the merging of type attributes needs
     special handling.  If defined, the result is a list of the combined
     `TYPE_ATTRIBUTES' of TYPE1 and TYPE2.  It is assumed that
     `comptypes' has already been called and returned 1.  This function
     may call `merge_attributes' to handle machine-independent merging.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_MERGE_DECL_ATTRIBUTES (tree OLDDECL, tree
          NEWDECL)
     Define this target hook if the merging of decl attributes needs
     special handling.  If defined, the result is a list of the combined
     `DECL_ATTRIBUTES' of OLDDECL and NEWDECL.  NEWDECL is a duplicate
     declaration of OLDDECL.  Examples of when this is needed are when
     one attribute overrides another, or when an attribute is nullified
     by a subsequent definition.  This function may call
     `merge_attributes' to handle machine-independent merging.

     If the only target-specific handling you require is `dllimport' for
     Microsoft Windows targets, you should define the macro
     `TARGET_DLLIMPORT_DECL_ATTRIBUTES'.  This links in a function
     called `merge_dllimport_decl_attributes' which can then be defined
     as the expansion of `TARGET_MERGE_DECL_ATTRIBUTES'.  This is done
     in `i386/cygwin.h' and `i386/i386.c', for example.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_INSERT_ATTRIBUTES (tree NODE, tree
          *ATTR_PTR)
     Define this target hook if you want to be able to add attributes
     to a decl when it is being created.  This is normally useful for
     back ends which wish to implement a pragma by using the attributes
     which correspond to the pragma's effect.  The NODE argument is the
     decl which is being created.  The ATTR_PTR argument is a pointer
     to the attribute list for this decl.  The list itself should not
     be modified, since it may be shared with other decls, but
     attributes may be chained on the head of the list and `*ATTR_PTR'
     modified to point to the new attributes, or a copy of the list may
     be made if further changes are needed.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FUNCTION_ATTRIBUTE_INLINABLE_P (tree
          FNDECL)
     This target hook returns `true' if it is ok to inline FNDECL into
     the current function, despite its having target-specific
     attributes, `false' otherwise.  By default, if a function has a
     target specific attribute attached to it, it will not be inlined.

11.25 Defining coprocessor specifics for MIPS targets.
======================================================

The MIPS specification allows MIPS implementations to have as many as 4
coprocessors, each with as many as 32 private registers.  GCC supports
accessing these registers and transferring values between the registers
and memory using asm-ized variables.  For example:

       register unsigned int cp0count asm ("c0r1");
       unsigned int d;

       d = cp0count + 3;

   ("c0r1" is the default name of register 1 in coprocessor 0; alternate
names may be added as described below, or the default names may be
overridden entirely in `SUBTARGET_CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE'.)

   Coprocessor registers are assumed to be epilogue-used; sets to them
will be preserved even if it does not appear that the register is used
again later in the function.

   Another note: according to the MIPS spec, coprocessor 1 (if present)
is the FPU.  One accesses COP1 registers through standard mips
floating-point support; they are not included in this mechanism.

   There is one macro used in defining the MIPS coprocessor interface
which you may want to override in subtargets; it is described below.

 -- Macro: ALL_COP_ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES
     A comma-separated list (with leading comma) of pairs describing the
     alternate names of coprocessor registers.  The format of each
     entry should be
          { ALTERNATENAME, REGISTER_NUMBER}
     Default: empty.

11.26 Parameters for Precompiled Header Validity Checking
=========================================================

 -- Target Hook: void * TARGET_GET_PCH_VALIDITY (size_t * SZ)
     Define this hook if your target needs to check a different
     collection of flags than the default, which is every flag defined
     by `TARGET_SWITCHES' and `TARGET_OPTIONS'.  It should return some
     data which will be saved in the PCH file and presented to
     `TARGET_PCH_VALID_P' later; it should set `SZ' to the size of the
     data.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_PCH_VALID_P (const void * DATA,
          size_t SZ)
     Define this hook if your target needs to check a different
     collection of flags than the default, which is every flag defined
     by `TARGET_SWITCHES' and `TARGET_OPTIONS'.  It is given data which
     came from `TARGET_GET_PCH_VALIDITY' (in this version of this
     compiler, so there is no need for extensive validity checking).
     It returns `NULL' if it is safe to load a PCH file with this data,
     or a suitable error message if not.  The error message will be
     presented to the user, so it should be localized.

11.27 Miscellaneous Parameters
==============================

Here are several miscellaneous parameters.

 -- Macro: PREDICATE_CODES
     Define this if you have defined special-purpose predicates in the
     file `MACHINE.c'.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
     array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the name
     of a predicate and the second field is an array of rtl codes.  For
     each predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in expressions
     matched by the predicate.  The list should have a trailing comma.
     Here is an example of two entries in the list for a typical RISC
     machine:

          #define PREDICATE_CODES \
            {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \
            {"reg_or_short_cint_operand", {SUBREG, REG, CONST_INT}},

     Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
     incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched by
     the predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction).  Instead, it
     allows the table built by `genrecog' to be more compact and
     efficient, thus speeding up the compiler.  The most important
     predicates to include in the list specified by this macro are
     those used in the most insn patterns.

     For each predicate function named in `PREDICATE_CODES', a
     declaration will be generated in `insn-codes.h'.

 -- Macro: SPECIAL_MODE_PREDICATES
     Define this if you have special predicates that know special things
     about modes.  Genrecog will warn about certain forms of
     `match_operand' without a mode; if the operand predicate is listed
     in `SPECIAL_MODE_PREDICATES', the warning will be suppressed.

     Here is an example from the IA-32 port (`ext_register_operand'
     specially checks for `HImode' or `SImode' in preparation for a
     byte extraction from `%ah' etc.).

          #define SPECIAL_MODE_PREDICATES \
            "ext_register_operand",

 -- Macro: CASE_VECTOR_MODE
     An alias for a machine mode name.  This is the machine mode that
     elements of a jump-table should have.

 -- Macro: CASE_VECTOR_SHORTEN_MODE (MIN_OFFSET, MAX_OFFSET, BODY)
     Optional: return the preferred mode for an `addr_diff_vec' when
     the minimum and maximum offset are known.  If you define this, it
     enables extra code in branch shortening to deal with
     `addr_diff_vec'.  To make this work, you also have to define
     `INSN_ALIGN' and make the alignment for `addr_diff_vec' explicit.
     The BODY argument is provided so that the offset_unsigned and scale
     flags can be updated.

 -- Macro: CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE
     Define this macro to be a C expression to indicate when jump-tables
     should contain relative addresses.  You need not define this macro
     if jump-tables never contain relative addresses, or jump-tables
     should contain relative addresses only when `-fPIC' or `-fPIC' is
     in effect.

 -- Macro: CASE_DROPS_THROUGH
     Define this if control falls through a `case' insn when the index
     value is out of range.  This means the specified default-label is
     actually ignored by the `case' insn proper.

 -- Macro: CASE_VALUES_THRESHOLD
     Define this to be the smallest number of different values for
     which it is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of
     conditional branches.  The default is four for machines with a
     `casesi' instruction and five otherwise.  This is best for most
     machines.

 -- Macro: CASE_USE_BIT_TESTS
     Define this macro to be a C expression to indicate whether C switch
     statements may be implemented by a sequence of bit tests.  This is
     advantageous on processors that can efficiently implement left
     shift of 1 by the number of bits held in a register, but
     inappropriate on targets that would require a loop.  By default,
     this macro returns `true' if the target defines an `ashlsi3'
     pattern, and `false' otherwise.

 -- Macro: WORD_REGISTER_OPERATIONS
     Define this macro if operations between registers with integral
     mode smaller than a word are always performed on the entire
     register.  Most RISC machines have this property and most CISC
     machines do not.

 -- Macro: LOAD_EXTEND_OP (MEM_MODE)
     Define this macro to be a C expression indicating when insns that
     read memory in MEM_MODE, an integral mode narrower than a word,
     set the bits outside of MEM_MODE to be either the sign-extension
     or the zero-extension of the data read.  Return `SIGN_EXTEND' for
     values of MEM_MODE for which the insn sign-extends, `ZERO_EXTEND'
     for which it zero-extends, and `NIL' for other modes.

     This macro is not called with MEM_MODE non-integral or with a width
     greater than or equal to `BITS_PER_WORD', so you may return any
     value in this case.  Do not define this macro if it would always
     return `NIL'.  On machines where this macro is defined, you will
     normally define it as the constant `SIGN_EXTEND' or `ZERO_EXTEND'.

     You may return a non-`NIL' value even if for some hard registers
     the sign extension is not performed, if for the `REGNO_REG_CLASS'
     of these hard registers `CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS' returns nonzero
     when the FROM mode is MEM_MODE and the TO mode is any integral
     mode larger than this but not larger than `word_mode'.

     You must return `NIL' if for some hard registers that allow this
     mode, `CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS' says that they cannot change to
     `word_mode', but that they can change to another integral mode that
     is larger then MEM_MODE but still smaller than `word_mode'.

 -- Macro: SHORT_IMMEDIATES_SIGN_EXTEND
     Define this macro if loading short immediate values into registers
     sign extends.

 -- Macro: FIXUNS_TRUNC_LIKE_FIX_TRUNC
     Define this macro if the same instructions that convert a floating
     point number to a signed fixed point number also convert validly
     to an unsigned one.

 -- Macro: MOVE_MAX
     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
     quickly between memory and registers or between two memory
     locations.

 -- Macro: MAX_MOVE_MAX
     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
     quickly between memory and registers or between two memory
     locations.  If this is undefined, the default is `MOVE_MAX'.
     Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the largest value that
     `MOVE_MAX' can have at run-time.

 -- Macro: SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED
     A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of
     bits actually used for the count of a shift operation is equal to
     the number of bits needed to represent the size of the object
     being shifted.  When this macro is nonzero, the compiler will
     assume that it is safe to omit a sign-extend, zero-extend, and
     certain bitwise `and' instructions that truncates the count of a
     shift operation.  On machines that have instructions that act on
     bit-fields at variable positions, which may include `bit test'
     instructions, a nonzero `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' also enables
     deletion of truncations of the values that serve as arguments to
     bit-field instructions.

     If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
     position (for bit-field operations), or if no variable-position
     bit-field instructions exist, you should define this macro.

     However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0,
     truncation only applies to shift operations and not the (real or
     pretended) bit-field operations.  Define `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED'
     to be zero on such machines.  Instead, add patterns to the `md'
     file that include the implied truncation of the shift instructions.

     You need not define this macro if it would always have the value
     of zero.

 -- Macro: TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION (OUTPREC, INPREC)
     A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
     "convert" an integer of INPREC bits to one of OUTPREC bits (where
     OUTPREC is smaller than INPREC) by merely operating on it as if it
     had only OUTPREC bits.

     On many machines, this expression can be 1.

     When `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' returns 1 for a pair of sizes for
     modes for which `MODES_TIEABLE_P' is 0, suboptimal code can result.
     If this is the case, making `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' return 0 in
     such cases may improve things.

 -- Macro: STORE_FLAG_VALUE
     A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison
     operator with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag
     instruction (`sCOND') when the condition is true.  This
     description must apply to _all_ the `sCOND' patterns and all the
     comparison operators whose results have a `MODE_INT' mode.

     A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
     comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is
     true and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value
     indicates which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the
     comparison is true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the
     comparison operation, which is given by the mode of the first
     operand in the `sCOND' pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign
     bit of `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' be on.  Presently, only those bits are
     used by the compiler.

     If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
     generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
     replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they
     cause the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are
     undefined.  For example, on a machine whose comparison operators
     return an `SImode' value and where `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is defined as
     `0x80000000', saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
     expression

          (ne:SI (and:SI X (const_int POWER-OF-2)) (const_int 0))

     can be converted to

          (ashift:SI X (const_int N))

     where N is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
     tested into the sign bit.

     There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the
     low-order bit for a true value, but does not guarantee the value
     of any other bits, but we do not know of any machine that has such
     an instruction.  If you are trying to port GCC to such a machine,
     include an instruction to perform a logical-and of the result with
     1 in the pattern for the comparison operators and let us know at
     <gcc@gcc.gnu.org>.

     Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a
     value from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules
     to guide the choice of value for `STORE_FLAG_VALUE', and hence the
     instructions to be used:

        * Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
          `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
          "normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for
          the comparison operators to do so because there may be
          opportunities to combine the normalization with other
          operations.

        * For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1
          being slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and
          1 preferred on other machines.

        * As a second choice, choose a value of `0x80000001' if
          instructions exist that set both the sign and low-order bits
          but do not define the others.

        * Otherwise, use a value of `0x80000000'.

     Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' and its negation in the same number of
     instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern
     for those cases, e.g., one matching

          (set A (neg:M (ne:M B C)))

     Some machines can also perform `and' or `plus' operations on
     condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
     `sCOND' insn followed by `and' or `plus'.  On those machines,
     define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names `incscc' and
     `decscc', respectively, for the patterns which perform `plus' or
     `minus' operations on condition code values.  See `rs6000.md' for
     some examples.  The GNU Superoptizer can be used to find such
     instruction sequences on other machines.

     If this macro is not defined, the default value, 1, is used.  You
     need not define `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the machine has no store-flag
     instructions, or if the value generated by these instructions is 1.

 -- Macro: FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE (MODE)
     A C expression that gives a nonzero `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' value that is
     returned when comparison operators with floating-point results are
     true.  Define this macro on machine that have comparison
     operations that return floating-point values.  If there are no
     such operations, do not define this macro.

 -- Macro: CLZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO (MODE, VALUE)
 -- Macro: CTZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO (MODE, VALUE)
     A C expression that evaluates to true if the architecture defines
     a value for `clz' or `ctz' with a zero operand.  If so, VALUE
     should be set to this value.  If this macro is not defined, the
     value of `clz' or `ctz' is assumed to be undefined.

     This macro must be defined if the target's expansion for `ffs'
     relies on a particular value to get correct results.  Otherwise it
     is not necessary, though it may be used to optimize some corner
     cases.

     Note that regardless of this macro the "definedness" of `clz' and
     `ctz' at zero do _not_ extend to the builtin functions visible to
     the user.  Thus one may be free to adjust the value at will to
     match the target expansion of these operations without fear of
     breaking the API.

 -- Macro: Pmode
     An alias for the machine mode for pointers.  On most machines,
     define this to be the integer mode corresponding to the width of a
     hardware pointer; `SImode' on 32-bit machine or `DImode' on 64-bit
     machines.  On some machines you must define this to be one of the
     partial integer modes, such as `PSImode'.

     The width of `Pmode' must be at least as large as the value of
     `POINTER_SIZE'.  If it is not equal, you must define the macro
     `POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED' to specify how pointers are extended to
     `Pmode'.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_MODE
     An alias for the machine mode used for memory references to
     functions being called, in `call' RTL expressions.  On most
     machines this should be `QImode'.

 -- Macro: INTEGRATE_THRESHOLD (DECL)
     A C expression for the maximum number of instructions above which
     the function DECL should not be inlined.  DECL is a
     `FUNCTION_DECL' node.

     The default definition of this macro is 64 plus 8 times the number
     of arguments that the function accepts.  Some people think a larger
     threshold should be used on RISC machines.

 -- Macro: STDC_0_IN_SYSTEM_HEADERS
     In normal operation, the preprocessor expands `__STDC__' to the
     constant 1, to signify that GCC conforms to ISO Standard C.  On
     some hosts, like Solaris, the system compiler uses a different
     convention, where `__STDC__' is normally 0, but is 1 if the user
     specifies strict conformance to the C Standard.

     Defining `STDC_0_IN_SYSTEM_HEADERS' makes GNU CPP follows the host
     convention when processing system header files, but when
     processing user files `__STDC__' will always expand to 1.

 -- Macro: NO_IMPLICIT_EXTERN_C
     Define this macro if the system header files support C++ as well
     as C.  This macro inhibits the usual method of using system header
     files in C++, which is to pretend that the file's contents are
     enclosed in `extern "C" {...}'.

 -- Macro: REGISTER_TARGET_PRAGMAS ()
     Define this macro if you want to implement any target-specific
     pragmas.  If defined, it is a C expression which makes a series of
     calls to `c_register_pragma' for each pragma.  The macro may also
     do any setup required for the pragmas.

     The primary reason to define this macro is to provide
     compatibility with other compilers for the same target.  In
     general, we discourage definition of target-specific pragmas for
     GCC.

     If the pragma can be implemented by attributes then you should
     consider defining the target hook `TARGET_INSERT_ATTRIBUTES' as
     well.

     Preprocessor macros that appear on pragma lines are not expanded.
     All `#pragma' directives that do not match any registered pragma
     are silently ignored, unless the user specifies
     `-Wunknown-pragmas'.

 -- Function: void c_register_pragma (const char *SPACE, const char
          *NAME, void (*CALLBACK) (struct cpp_reader *))
     Each call to `c_register_pragma' establishes one pragma.  The
     CALLBACK routine will be called when the preprocessor encounters a
     pragma of the form

          #pragma [SPACE] NAME ...

     SPACE is the case-sensitive namespace of the pragma, or `NULL' to
     put the pragma in the global namespace.  The callback routine
     receives PFILE as its first argument, which can be passed on to
     cpplib's functions if necessary.  You can lex tokens after the
     NAME by calling `c_lex'.  Tokens that are not read by the callback
     will be silently ignored.  The end of the line is indicated by a
     token of type `CPP_EOF'

     For an example use of this routine, see `c4x.h' and the callback
     routines defined in `c4x-c.c'.

     Note that the use of `c_lex' is specific to the C and C++
     compilers.  It will not work in the Java or Fortran compilers, or
     any other language compilers for that matter.  Thus if `c_lex' is
     going to be called from target-specific code, it must only be done
     so when building the C and C++ compilers.  This can be done by
     defining the variables `c_target_objs' and `cxx_target_objs' in the
     target entry in the `config.gcc' file.  These variables should name
     the target-specific, language-specific object file which contains
     the code that uses `c_lex'.  Note it will also be necessary to add
     a rule to the makefile fragment pointed to by `tmake_file' that
     shows how to build this object file.

 -- Macro: HANDLE_SYSV_PRAGMA
     Define this macro (to a value of 1) if you want the System V style
     pragmas `#pragma pack(<n>)' and `#pragma weak <name> [=<value>]'
     to be supported by gcc.

     The pack pragma specifies the maximum alignment (in bytes) of
     fields within a structure, in much the same way as the
     `__aligned__' and `__packed__' `__attribute__'s do.  A pack value
     of zero resets the behavior to the default.

     A subtlety for Microsoft Visual C/C++ style bit-field packing
     (e.g. -mms-bitfields) for targets that support it: When a
     bit-field is inserted into a packed record, the whole size of the
     underlying type is used by one or more same-size adjacent
     bit-fields (that is, if its long:3, 32 bits is used in the record,
     and any additional adjacent long bit-fields are packed into the
     same chunk of 32 bits. However, if the size changes, a new field
     of that size is allocated).

     If both MS bit-fields and `__attribute__((packed))' are used, the
     latter will take precedence. If `__attribute__((packed))' is used
     on a single field when MS bit-fields are in use, it will take
     precedence for that field, but the alignment of the rest of the
     structure may affect its placement.

     The weak pragma only works if `SUPPORTS_WEAK' and
     `ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' are defined.  If enabled it allows the creation
     of specifically named weak labels, optionally with a value.

 -- Macro: HANDLE_PRAGMA_PACK_PUSH_POP
     Define this macro (to a value of 1) if you want to support the
     Win32 style pragmas `#pragma pack(push,N)' and `#pragma
     pack(pop)'.  The `pack(push,N)' pragma specifies the maximum
     alignment (in bytes) of fields within a structure, in much the
     same way as the `__aligned__' and `__packed__' `__attribute__'s
     do.  A pack value of zero resets the behavior to the default.
     Successive invocations of this pragma cause the previous values to
     be stacked, so that invocations of `#pragma pack(pop)' will return
     to the previous value.

 -- Macro: DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS
     Define this macro to control use of the character `$' in
     identifier names for the C family of languages.  0 means `$' is
     not allowed by default; 1 means it is allowed.  1 is the default;
     there is no need to define this macro in that case.

 -- Macro: NO_DOLLAR_IN_LABEL
     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
     `$' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in
     G++ have `$' in the identifiers.  If this macro is defined, `.' is
     used instead.

 -- Macro: NO_DOT_IN_LABEL
     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
     `.' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in G++
     have names that use `.'.  If this macro is defined, these names
     are rewritten to avoid `.'.

 -- Macro: DEFAULT_MAIN_RETURN
     Define this macro if the target system expects every program's
     `main' function to return a standard "success" value by default
     (if no other value is explicitly returned).

     The definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to
     generate the appropriate rtl instructions.  It is used only when
     compiling the end of `main'.

 -- Macro: INSN_SETS_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
     slot of INSN, even if they appear to use a resource set or
     clobbered in INSN.  INSN is always a `jump_insn' or an `insn'; GCC
     knows that every `call_insn' has this behavior.  On machines where
     some `insn' or `jump_insn' is really a function call and hence has
     this behavior, you should define this macro.

     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

 -- Macro: INSN_REFERENCES_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
     slot of INSN, even if they appear to set or clobber a resource
     referenced in INSN.  INSN is always a `jump_insn' or an `insn'.
     On machines where some `insn' or `jump_insn' is really a function
     call and its operands are registers whose use is actually in the
     subroutine it calls, you should define this macro.  Doing so
     allows the delay slot scheduler to move instructions which copy
     arguments into the argument registers into the delay slot of INSN.

     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

 -- Macro: MULTIPLE_SYMBOL_SPACES
     Define this macro if in some cases global symbols from one
     translation unit may not be bound to undefined symbols in another
     translation unit without user intervention.  For instance, under
     Microsoft Windows symbols must be explicitly imported from shared
     libraries (DLLs).

 -- Macro: MD_ASM_CLOBBERS (CLOBBERS)
     A C statement that adds to CLOBBERS `STRING_CST' trees for any
     hard regs the port wishes to automatically clobber for all asms.

 -- Macro: MATH_LIBRARY
     Define this macro as a C string constant for the linker argument
     to link in the system math library, or `""' if the target does not
     have a separate math library.

     You need only define this macro if the default of `"-lm"' is wrong.

 -- Macro: LIBRARY_PATH_ENV
     Define this macro as a C string constant for the environment
     variable that specifies where the linker should look for libraries.

     You need only define this macro if the default of `"LIBRARY_PATH"'
     is wrong.

 -- Macro: TARGET_HAS_F_SETLKW
     Define this macro if the target supports file locking with fcntl /
     F_SETLKW.  Note that this functionality is part of POSIX.
     Defining `TARGET_HAS_F_SETLKW' will enable the test coverage code
     to use file locking when exiting a program, which avoids race
     conditions if the program has forked.

 -- Macro: MAX_CONDITIONAL_EXECUTE
     A C expression for the maximum number of instructions to execute
     via conditional execution instructions instead of a branch.  A
     value of `BRANCH_COST'+1 is the default if the machine does not
     use cc0, and 1 if it does use cc0.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_TESTS (CE_INFO, TRUE_EXPR, FALSE_EXPR)
     Used if the target needs to perform machine-dependent
     modifications on the conditionals used for turning basic blocks
     into conditionally executed code.  CE_INFO points to a data
     structure, `struct ce_if_block', which contains information about
     the currently processed blocks.  TRUE_EXPR and FALSE_EXPR are the
     tests that are used for converting the then-block and the
     else-block, respectively.  Set either TRUE_EXPR or FALSE_EXPR to a
     null pointer if the tests cannot be converted.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_MULTIPLE_TESTS (CE_INFO, BB, TRUE_EXPR,
          FALSE_EXPR)
     Like `IFCVT_MODIFY_TESTS', but used when converting more
     complicated if-statements into conditions combined by `and' and
     `or' operations.  BB contains the basic block that contains the
     test that is currently being processed and about to be turned into
     a condition.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_INSN (CE_INFO, PATTERN, INSN)
     A C expression to modify the PATTERN of an INSN that is to be
     converted to conditional execution format.  CE_INFO points to a
     data structure, `struct ce_if_block', which contains information
     about the currently processed blocks.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_FINAL (CE_INFO)
     A C expression to perform any final machine dependent
     modifications in converting code to conditional execution.  The
     involved basic blocks can be found in the `struct ce_if_block'
     structure that is pointed to by CE_INFO.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_CANCEL (CE_INFO)
     A C expression to cancel any machine dependent modifications in
     converting code to conditional execution.  The involved basic
     blocks can be found in the `struct ce_if_block' structure that is
     pointed to by CE_INFO.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_INIT_EXTRA_FIELDS (CE_INFO)
     A C expression to initialize any extra fields in a `struct
     ce_if_block' structure, which are defined by the
     `IFCVT_EXTRA_FIELDS' macro.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_EXTRA_FIELDS
     If defined, it should expand to a set of field declarations that
     will be added to the `struct ce_if_block' structure.  These should
     be initialized by the `IFCVT_INIT_EXTRA_FIELDS' macro.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG ()
     If non-null, this hook performs a target-specific pass over the
     instruction stream.  The compiler will run it at all optimization
     levels, just before the point at which it normally does
     delayed-branch scheduling.

     The exact purpose of the hook varies from target to target.  Some
     use it to do transformations that are necessary for correctness,
     such as laying out in-function constant pools or avoiding hardware
     hazards.  Others use it as an opportunity to do some
     machine-dependent optimizations.

     You need not implement the hook if it has nothing to do.  The
     default definition is null.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS ()
     Define this hook if you have any machine-specific built-in
     functions that need to be defined.  It should be a function that
     performs the necessary setup.

     Machine specific built-in functions can be useful to expand
     special machine instructions that would otherwise not normally be
     generated because they have no equivalent in the source language
     (for example, SIMD vector instructions or prefetch instructions).

     To create a built-in function, call the function `builtin_function'
     which is defined by the language front end.  You can use any type
     nodes set up by `build_common_tree_nodes' and
     `build_common_tree_nodes_2'; only language front ends that use
     those two functions will call `TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS'.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_EXPAND_BUILTIN (tree EXP, rtx TARGET, rtx
          SUBTARGET, enum machine_mode MODE, int IGNORE)
     Expand a call to a machine specific built-in function that was set
     up by `TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS'.  EXP is the expression for the
     function call; the result should go to TARGET if that is
     convenient, and have mode MODE if that is convenient.  SUBTARGET
     may be used as the target for computing one of EXP's operands.
     IGNORE is nonzero if the value is to be ignored.  This function
     should return the result of the call to the built-in function.

 -- Macro: MD_CAN_REDIRECT_BRANCH (BRANCH1, BRANCH2)
     Take a branch insn in BRANCH1 and another in BRANCH2.  Return true
     if redirecting BRANCH1 to the destination of BRANCH2 is possible.

     On some targets, branches may have a limited range.  Optimizing the
     filling of delay slots can result in branches being redirected,
     and this may in turn cause a branch offset to overflow.

 -- Macro: ALLOCATE_INITIAL_VALUE (HARD_REG)
     When the initial value of a hard register has been copied in a
     pseudo register, it is often not necessary to actually allocate
     another register to this pseudo register, because the original
     hard register or a stack slot it has been saved into can be used.
     `ALLOCATE_INITIAL_VALUE', if defined, is called at the start of
     register allocation once for each hard register that had its
     initial value copied by using `get_func_hard_reg_initial_val' or
     `get_hard_reg_initial_val'.  Possible values are `NULL_RTX', if
     you don't want to do any special allocation, a `REG' rtx--that
     would typically be the hard register itself, if it is known not to
     be clobbered--or a `MEM'.  If you are returning a `MEM', this is
     only a hint for the allocator; it might decide to use another
     register anyways.  You may use `current_function_leaf_function' in
     the definition of the macro, functions that use `REG_N_SETS', to
     determine if the hard register in question will not be clobbered.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OBJECT_SUFFIX
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
     object files on your target machine.  If you do not define this
     macro, GCC will use `.o' as the suffix for object files.

 -- Macro: TARGET_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix to be
     automatically added to executable files on your target machine.
     If you do not define this macro, GCC will use the null string as
     the suffix for executable files.

 -- Macro: COLLECT_EXPORT_LIST
     If defined, `collect2' will scan the individual object files
     specified on its command line and create an export list for the
     linker.  Define this macro for systems like AIX, where the linker
     discards object files that are not referenced from `main' and uses
     export lists.

 -- Macro: MODIFY_JNI_METHOD_CALL (MDECL)
     Define this macro to a C expression representing a variant of the
     method call MDECL, if Java Native Interface (JNI) methods must be
     invoked differently from other methods on your target.  For
     example, on 32-bit Microsoft Windows, JNI methods must be invoked
     using the `stdcall' calling convention and this macro is then
     defined as this expression:

          build_type_attribute_variant (MDECL,
                                        build_tree_list
                                        (get_identifier ("stdcall"),
                                         NULL))

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CANNOT_MODIFY_JUMPS_P (void)
     This target hook returns `true' past the point in which new jump
     instructions could be created.  On machines that require a
     register for every jump such as the SHmedia ISA of SH5, this point
     would typically be reload, so this target hook should be defined
     to a function such as:

          static bool
          cannot_modify_jumps_past_reload_p ()
          {
            return (reload_completed || reload_in_progress);
          }

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_BRANCH_TARGET_REGISTER_CLASS (void)
     This target hook returns a register class for which branch target
     register optimizations should be applied.  All registers in this
     class should be usable interchangeably.  After reload, registers
     in this class will be re-allocated and loads will be hoisted out
     of loops and be subjected to inter-block scheduling.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_BRANCH_TARGET_REGISTER_CALLEE_SAVED (bool
          AFTER_PROLOGUE_EPILOGUE_GEN)
     Branch target register optimization will by default exclude
     callee-saved registers that are not already live during the
     current function; if this target hook returns true, they will be
     included.  The target code must than make sure that all target
     registers in the class returned by
     `TARGET_BRANCH_TARGET_REGISTER_CLASS' that might need saving are
     saved.  AFTER_PROLOGUE_EPILOGUE_GEN indicates if prologues and
     epilogues have already been generated.  Note, even if you only
     return true when AFTER_PROLOGUE_EPILOGUE_GEN is false, you still
     are likely to have to make special provisions in
     `INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET' to reserve space for caller-saved
     target registers.

 -- Macro: POWI_MAX_MULTS
     If defined, this macro is interpreted as a signed integer C
     expression that specifies the maximum number of floating point
     multiplications that should be emitted when expanding
     exponentiation by an integer constant inline.  When this value is
     defined, exponentiation requiring more than this number of
     multiplications is implemented by calling the system library's
     `pow', `powf' or `powl' routines.  The default value places no
     upper bound on the multiplication count.

12 Host Configuration
*********************

Most details about the machine and system on which the compiler is
actually running are detected by the `configure' script.  Some things
are impossible for `configure' to detect; these are described in two
ways, either by macros defined in a file named `xm-MACHINE.h' or by
hook functions in the file specified by the OUT_HOST_HOOK_OBJ variable
in `config.gcc'.  (The intention is that very few hosts will need a
header file but nearly every fully supported host will need to override
some hooks.)

   If you need to define only a few macros, and they have simple
definitions, consider using the `xm_defines' variable in your
`config.gcc' entry instead of creating a host configuration header.
*Note System Config::.

* Menu:

* Host Common::		Things every host probably needs implemented.
* Filesystem::          Your host can't have the letter `a' in filenames?
* Host Misc::         	Rare configuration options for hosts.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Host Common,  Next: Filesystem,  Up: Host Config

12.1 Host Common
================

Some things are just not portable, even between similar operating
systems, and are too difficult for autoconf to detect.  They get
implemented using hook functions in the file specified by the
HOST_HOOK_OBJ variable in `config.gcc'.

 -- Host Hook: void HOST_HOOKS_EXTRA_SIGNALS (void)
     This host hook is used to set up handling for extra signals.  The
     most common thing to do in this hook is to detect stack overflow.

 -- Host Hook: void * HOST_HOOKS_GT_PCH_GET_ADDRESS (size_t SIZE, int
          FD)
     This host hook returns the address of some space that is likely to
     be free in some subsequent invocation of the compiler.  We intend
     to load the PCH data at this address such that the data need not
     be relocated.  The area should be able to hold SIZE bytes.  If the
     host uses `mmap', FD is an open file descriptor that can be used
     for probing.

 -- Host Hook: int HOST_HOOKS_GT_PCH_USE_ADDRESS (void * ADDRESS,
          size_t SIZE, int FD, size_t OFFSET)
     This host hook is called when a PCH file is about to be loaded.
     We want to load SIZE bytes from FD at OFFSET into memory at
     ADDRESS.  The given address will be the result of a previous
     invocation of `HOST_HOOKS_GT_PCH_GET_ADDRESS'.  Return -1 if we
     couldn't allocate SIZE bytes at ADDRESS.  Return 0 if the memory
     is allocated but the data is not loaded.  Return 1 if the hook has
     performed everything.

     If the implementation uses reserved address space, free any
     reserved space beyond SIZE, regardless of the return value.  If no
     PCH will be loaded, this hook may be called with SIZE zero, in
     which case all reserved address space should be freed.

     Do not try to handle values of ADDRESS that could not have been
     returned by this executable; just return -1.  Such values usually
     indicate an out-of-date PCH file (built by some other GCC
     executable), and such a PCH file won't work.

12.2 Host Filesystem
====================

GCC needs to know a number of things about the semantics of the host
machine's filesystem.  Filesystems with Unix and MS-DOS semantics are
automatically detected.  For other systems, you can define the
following macros in `xm-MACHINE.h'.

`HAVE_DOS_BASED_FILE_SYSTEM'
     This macro is automatically defined by `system.h' if the host file
     system obeys the semantics defined by MS-DOS instead of Unix.  DOS
     file systems are case insensitive, file specifications may begin
     with a drive letter, and both forward slash and backslash (`/' and
     `\') are directory separators.

`DIR_SEPARATOR'
`DIR_SEPARATOR_2'
     If defined, these macros expand to character constants specifying
     separators for directory names within a file specification.
     `system.h' will automatically give them appropriate values on Unix
     and MS-DOS file systems.  If your file system is neither of these,
     define one or both appropriately in `xm-MACHINE.h'.

     However, operating systems like VMS, where constructing a pathname
     is more complicated than just stringing together directory names
     separated by a special character, should not define either of these
     macros.

`PATH_SEPARATOR'
     If defined, this macro should expand to a character constant
     specifying the separator for elements of search paths.  The default
     value is a colon (`:').  DOS-based systems usually, but not
     always, use semicolon (`;').

`VMS'
     Define this macro if the host system is VMS.

`HOST_OBJECT_SUFFIX'
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
     object files on your host machine.  If you do not define this
     macro, GCC will use `.o' as the suffix for object files.

`HOST_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX'
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
     executable files on your host machine.  If you do not define this
     macro, GCC will use the null string as the suffix for executable
     files.

`HOST_BIT_BUCKET'
     A pathname defined by the host operating system, which can be
     opened as a file and written to, but all the information written
     is discarded.  This is commonly known as a "bit bucket" or "null
     device".  If you do not define this macro, GCC will use
     `/dev/null' as the bit bucket.  If the host does not support a bit
     bucket, define this macro to an invalid filename.

`UPDATE_PATH_HOST_CANONICALIZE (PATH)'
     If defined, a C statement (sans semicolon) that performs
     host-dependent canonicalization when a path used in a compilation
     driver or preprocessor is canonicalized.  PATH is a malloc-ed path
     to be canonicalized.  If the C statement does canonicalize PATH
     into a different buffer, the old path should be freed and the new
     buffer should have been allocated with malloc.

`DUMPFILE_FORMAT'
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the format to use
     for constructing the index part of debugging dump file names.  The
     resultant string must fit in fifteen bytes.  The full filename
     will be the concatenation of: the prefix of the assembler file
     name, the string resulting from applying this format to an index
     number, and a string unique to each dump file kind, e.g. `rtl'.

     If you do not define this macro, GCC will use `.%02d.'.  You should
     define this macro if using the default will create an invalid file
     name.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Host Misc,  Prev: Filesystem,  Up: Host Config

12.3 Host Misc
==============

`FATAL_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits after serious errors.  The default is the system-provided
     macro `EXIT_FAILURE', or `1' if the system doesn't define that
     macro.  Define this macro only if these defaults are incorrect.

`SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits without serious errors.  (Warnings are not serious errors.)
     The default is the system-provided macro `EXIT_SUCCESS', or `0' if
     the system doesn't define that macro.  Define this macro only if
     these defaults are incorrect.

`USE_C_ALLOCA'
     Define this macro if GCC should use the C implementation of
     `alloca' provided by `libiberty.a'.  This only affects how some
     parts of the compiler itself allocate memory.  It does not change
     code generation.

     When GCC is built with a compiler other than itself, the C `alloca'
     is always used.  This is because most other implementations have
     serious bugs.  You should define this macro only on a system where
     no stack-based `alloca' can possibly work.  For instance, if a
     system has a small limit on the size of the stack, GCC's builtin
     `alloca' will not work reliably.

`COLLECT2_HOST_INITIALIZATION'
     If defined, a C statement (sans semicolon) that performs
     host-dependent initialization when `collect2' is being initialized.

`GCC_DRIVER_HOST_INITIALIZATION'
     If defined, a C statement (sans semicolon) that performs
     host-dependent initialization when a compilation driver is being
     initialized.

`SMALL_ARG_MAX'
     Define this macro if the host system has a small limit on the total
     size of an argument vector.  This causes the driver to take more
     care not to pass unnecessary arguments to subprocesses.

   In addition, if `configure' generates an incorrect definition of any
of the macros in `auto-host.h', you can override that definition in a
host configuration header.  If you need to do this, first see if it is
possible to fix `configure'.

13 Makefile Fragments
*********************

When you configure GCC using the `configure' script, it will construct
the file `Makefile' from the template file `Makefile.in'.  When it does
this, it can incorporate makefile fragments from the `config'
directory.  These are used to set Makefile parameters that are not
amenable to being calculated by autoconf.  The list of fragments to
incorporate is set by `config.gcc' (and occasionally `config.build' and
`config.host'); *Note System Config::.

   Fragments are named either `t-TARGET' or `x-HOST', depending on
whether they are relevant to configuring GCC to produce code for a
particular target, or to configuring GCC to run on a particular host.
Here TARGET and HOST are mnemonics which usually have some relationship
to the canonical system name, but no formal connection.

   If these files do not exist, it means nothing needs to be added for a
given target or host.  Most targets need a few `t-TARGET' fragments,
but needing `x-HOST' fragments is rare.

* Menu:

* Target Fragment:: Writing `t-TARGET' files.
* Host Fragment::   Writing `x-HOST' files.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Target Fragment,  Next: Host Fragment,  Up: Fragments

13.1 Target Makefile Fragments
==============================

Target makefile fragments can set these Makefile variables.

`LIBGCC2_CFLAGS'
     Compiler flags to use when compiling `libgcc2.c'.

`LIB2FUNCS_EXTRA'
     A list of source file names to be compiled or assembled and
     inserted into `libgcc.a'.

`Floating Point Emulation'
     To have GCC include software floating point libraries in `libgcc.a'
     define `FPBIT' and `DPBIT' along with a few rules as follows:
          # We want fine grained libraries, so use the new code
          # to build the floating point emulation libraries.
          FPBIT = fp-bit.c
          DPBIT = dp-bit.c


          fp-bit.c: $(srcdir)/config/fp-bit.c
                  echo '#define FLOAT' > fp-bit.c
                  cat $(srcdir)/config/fp-bit.c >> fp-bit.c

          dp-bit.c: $(srcdir)/config/fp-bit.c
                  cat $(srcdir)/config/fp-bit.c > dp-bit.c

     You may need to provide additional #defines at the beginning of
     `fp-bit.c' and `dp-bit.c' to control target endianness and other
     options.

`CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS'
     Special flags used when compiling `crtstuff.c'.  *Note
     Initialization::.

`CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS_S'
     Special flags used when compiling `crtstuff.c' for shared linking.
     Used if you use `crtbeginS.o' and `crtendS.o' in `EXTRA-PARTS'.
     *Note Initialization::.

`MULTILIB_OPTIONS'
     For some targets, invoking GCC in different ways produces objects
     that can not be linked together.  For example, for some targets GCC
     produces both big and little endian code.  For these targets, you
     must arrange for multiple versions of `libgcc.a' to be compiled,
     one for each set of incompatible options.  When GCC invokes the
     linker, it arranges to link in the right version of `libgcc.a',
     based on the command line options used.

     The `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' macro lists the set of options for which
     special versions of `libgcc.a' must be built.  Write options that
     are mutually incompatible side by side, separated by a slash.
     Write options that may be used together separated by a space.  The
     build procedure will build all combinations of compatible options.

     For example, if you set `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' to `m68000/m68020
     msoft-float', `Makefile' will build special versions of `libgcc.a'
     using the following sets of options:  `-m68000', `-m68020',
     `-msoft-float', `-m68000 -msoft-float', and `-m68020 -msoft-float'.

`MULTILIB_DIRNAMES'
     If `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is used, this variable specifies the
     directory names that should be used to hold the various libraries.
     Write one element in `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' for each element in
     `MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.  If `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' is not used, the
     default value will be `MULTILIB_OPTIONS', with all slashes treated
     as spaces.

     For example, if `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is set to `m68000/m68020
     msoft-float', then the default value of `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' is
     `m68000 m68020 msoft-float'.  You may specify a different value if
     you desire a different set of directory names.

`MULTILIB_MATCHES'
     Sometimes the same option may be written in two different ways.
     If an option is listed in `MULTILIB_OPTIONS', GCC needs to know
     about any synonyms.  In that case, set `MULTILIB_MATCHES' to a
     list of items of the form `option=option' to describe all relevant
     synonyms.  For example, `m68000=mc68000 m68020=mc68020'.

`MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS'
     Sometimes when there are multiple sets of `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' being
     specified, there are combinations that should not be built.  In
     that case, set `MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS' to be all of the switch
     exceptions in shell case syntax that should not be built.

     For example the ARM processor cannot execute both hardware floating
     point instructions and the reduced size THUMB instructions at the
     same time, so there is no need to build libraries with both of
     these options enabled.  Therefore `MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS' is set to:
          *mthumb/*mhard-float*

`MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS'
     Sometimes it is desirable that when building multiple versions of
     `libgcc.a' certain options should always be passed on to the
     compiler.  In that case, set `MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS' to be the list
     of options to be used for all builds.  If you set this, you should
     probably set `CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS' to a dash followed by it.

`SPECS'
     Unfortunately, setting `MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS' is not enough, since
     it does not affect the build of target libraries, at least not the
     build of the default multilib.  One possible work-around is to use
     `DRIVER_SELF_SPECS' to bring options from the `specs' file as if
     they had been passed in the compiler driver command line.
     However, you don't want to be adding these options after the
     toolchain is installed, so you can instead tweak the `specs' file
     that will be used during the toolchain build, while you still
     install the original, built-in `specs'.  The trick is to set
     `SPECS' to some other filename (say `specs.install'), that will
     then be created out of the built-in specs, and introduce a
     `Makefile' rule to generate the `specs' file that's going to be
     used at build time out of your `specs.install'.

13.2 Host Makefile Fragments
============================

The use of `x-HOST' fragments is discouraged.  You should do so only if
there is no other mechanism to get the behavior desired.  Host
fragments should never forcibly override variables set by the configure
script, as they may have been adjusted by the user.

   Variables provided for host fragments to set include:

`X_CFLAGS'
`X_CPPFLAGS'
     These are extra flags to pass to the C compiler and preprocessor,
     respectively.  They are used both when building GCC, and when
     compiling things with the just-built GCC.

`XCFLAGS'
     These are extra flags to use when building the compiler.  They are
     not used when compiling `libgcc.a'.  However, they _are_ used when
     recompiling the compiler with itself in later stages of a
     bootstrap.

`BOOT_LDFLAGS'
     Flags to be passed to the linker when recompiling the compiler with
     itself in later stages of a bootstrap.  You might need to use this
     if, for instance, one of the front ends needs more text space than
     the linker provides by default.

`EXTRA_PROGRAMS'
     A list of additional programs required to use the compiler on this
     host, which should be compiled with GCC and installed alongside
     the front ends.  If you set this variable, you must also provide
     rules to build the extra programs.



File: gccint.info,  Node: Collect2,  Next: Header Dirs,  Prev: Fragments,  Up: Top

14 `collect2'
*************

GCC uses a utility called `collect2' on nearly all systems to arrange
to call various initialization functions at start time.

   The program `collect2' works by linking the program once and looking
through the linker output file for symbols with particular names
indicating they are constructor functions.  If it finds any, it creates
a new temporary `.c' file containing a table of them, compiles it, and
links the program a second time including that file.

   The actual calls to the constructors are carried out by a subroutine
called `__main', which is called (automatically) at the beginning of
the body of `main' (provided `main' was compiled with GNU CC).  Calling
`__main' is necessary, even when compiling C code, to allow linking C
and C++ object code together.  (If you use `-nostdlib', you get an
unresolved reference to `__main', since it's defined in the standard
GCC library.  Include `-lgcc' at the end of your compiler command line
to resolve this reference.)

   The program `collect2' is installed as `ld' in the directory where
the passes of the compiler are installed.  When `collect2' needs to
find the _real_ `ld', it tries the following file names:

   * `real-ld' in the directories listed in the compiler's search
     directories.

   * `real-ld' in the directories listed in the environment variable
     `PATH'.

   * The file specified in the `REAL_LD_FILE_NAME' configuration macro,
     if specified.

   * `ld' in the compiler's search directories, except that `collect2'
     will not execute itself recursively.

   * `ld' in `PATH'.

   "The compiler's search directories" means all the directories where
`gcc' searches for passes of the compiler.  This includes directories
that you specify with `-B'.

   Cross-compilers search a little differently:

   * `real-ld' in the compiler's search directories.

   * `TARGET-real-ld' in `PATH'.

   * The file specified in the `REAL_LD_FILE_NAME' configuration macro,
     if specified.

   * `ld' in the compiler's search directories.

   * `TARGET-ld' in `PATH'.

   `collect2' explicitly avoids running `ld' using the file name under
which `collect2' itself was invoked.  In fact, it remembers up a list
of such names--in case one copy of `collect2' finds another copy (or
version) of `collect2' installed as `ld' in a second place in the
search path.

   `collect2' searches for the utilities `nm' and `strip' using the
same algorithm as above for `ld'.

15 Standard Header File Directories
***********************************

`GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' means the same thing for native and cross.  It is
where GCC stores its private include files, and also where GCC stores
the fixed include files.  A cross compiled GCC runs `fixincludes' on
the header files in `$(tooldir)/include'.  (If the cross compilation
header files need to be fixed, they must be installed before GCC is
built.  If the cross compilation header files are already suitable for
GCC, nothing special need be done).

   `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' means the same thing for native and cross.
It is where `g++' looks first for header files.  The C++ library
installs only target independent header files in that directory.

   `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only by native compilers.  GCC doesn't
install anything there.  It is normally `/usr/local/include'.  This is
where local additions to a packaged system should place header files.

   `CROSS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only by cross compilers.  GCC doesn't
install anything there.

   `TOOL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used for both native and cross compilers.  It
is the place for other packages to install header files that GCC will
use.  For a cross-compiler, this is the equivalent of `/usr/include'.
When you build a cross-compiler, `fixincludes' processes any header
files in this directory.

16 Memory Management and Type Information
*****************************************

GCC uses some fairly sophisticated memory management techniques, which
involve determining information about GCC's data structures from GCC's
source code and using this information to perform garbage collection and
implement precompiled headers.

   A full C parser would be too overcomplicated for this task, so a
limited subset of C is interpreted and special markers are used to
determine what parts of the source to look at.  The parser can also
detect simple typedefs of the form `typedef struct ID1 *ID2;' and
`typedef int ID3;', and these don't need to be specially marked.

   The two forms that do need to be marked are:

struct ID1 GTY(([options]))
{
  [fields]
};

typedef struct ID2 GTY(([options]))
{
  [fields]
} ID3;

* GTY Options::		What goes inside a `GTY(())'.
* GGC Roots::		Making global variables GGC roots.
* Files::		How the generated files work.


File: gccint.info,  Node: GTY Options,  Next: GGC Roots,  Up: Type Information

16.1 The Inside of a `GTY(())'
==============================

Sometimes the C code is not enough to fully describe the type structure.
Extra information can be provided by using more `GTY' markers.  These
markers can be placed:
   * In a structure definition, before the open brace;

   * In a global variable declaration, after the keyword `static' or
     `extern'; and

   * In a structure field definition, before the name of the field.

   The format of a marker is

GTY (([name] ([param]), [name] ([param]) ...))
 The parameter is either a string or a type name.

   When the parameter is a string, often it is a fragment of C code.
Three special escapes may be available:

`%h'
     This expands to an expression that evaluates to the current
     structure.

`%1'
     This expands to an expression that evaluates to the structure that
     immediately contains the current structure.

`%0'
     This expands to an expression that evaluates to the outermost
     structure that contains the current structure.

`%a'
     This expands to the string of the form `[i1][i2]...' that indexes
     the array item currently being marked.  For instance, if the field
     being marked is `foo', then `%1.foo%a' is the same as `%h'.

   The available options are:

`length'
     There are two places the type machinery will need to be explicitly
     told the length of an array.  The first case is when a structure
     ends in a variable-length array, like this:
     struct rtvec_def GTY(()) {
       int num_elem;		/* number of elements */
       rtx GTY ((length ("%h.num_elem"))) elem[1];
     };
      In this case, the `length' option is used to override the
     specified array length (which should usually be `1').  The
     parameter of the option is a fragment of C code that calculates
     the length.

     The second case is when a structure or a global variable contains a
     pointer to an array, like this:
          tree *
            GTY ((length ("%h.regno_pointer_align_length"))) regno_decl;
     In this case, `regno_decl' has been allocated by writing something
     like
            x->regno_decl =
              ggc_alloc (x->regno_pointer_align_length * sizeof (tree));
     and the `length' provides the length of the field.

     This second use of `length' also works on global variables, like:
       static GTY((length ("reg_base_value_size")))
         rtx *reg_base_value;

`skip'
     If `skip' is applied to a field, the type machinery will ignore it.
     This is somewhat dangerous; the only safe use is in a union when
     one field really isn't ever used.

`desc'
`tag'
`default'
     The type machinery needs to be told which field of a `union' is
     currently active.  This is done by giving each field a constant
     `tag' value, and then specifying a discriminator using `desc'.
     The value of the expression given by `desc' is compared against
     each `tag' value, each of which should be different.  If no `tag'
     is matched, the field marked with `default' is used if there is
     one, otherwise no field in the union will be marked.

     In the `desc' option, the "current structure" is the union that it
     discriminates.  Use `%1' to mean the structure containing it.
     (There are no escapes available to the `tag' option, since it's
     supposed to be a constant.)

     For example,
          struct tree_binding GTY(())
          {
            struct tree_common common;
            union tree_binding_u {
              tree GTY ((tag ("0"))) scope;
              struct cp_binding_level * GTY ((tag ("1"))) level;
            } GTY ((desc ("BINDING_HAS_LEVEL_P ((tree)&%0)"))) xscope;
            tree value;
          };

     In this example, the value of BINDING_HAS_LEVEL_P when applied to a
     `struct tree_binding *' is presumed to be 0 or 1.  If 1, the type
     mechanism will treat the field `level' as being present and if 0,
     will treat the field `scope' as being present.

`param_is'
`use_param'
     Sometimes it's convenient to define some data structure to work on
     generic pointers (that is, `PTR') and then use it with a specific
     type.  `param_is' specifies the real type pointed to, and
     `use_param' says where in the generic data structure that type
     should be put.

     For instance, to have a `htab_t' that points to trees, one should
     write
       htab_t GTY ((param_is (union tree_node))) ict;

`paramN_is'
`use_paramN'
     In more complicated cases, the data structure might need to work on
     several different types, which might not necessarily all be
     pointers.  For this, `param1_is' through `param9_is' may be used to
     specify the real type of a field identified by `use_param1' through
     `use_param9'.

`use_params'
     When a structure contains another structure that is parameterized,
     there's no need to do anything special, the inner structure
     inherits the parameters of the outer one.  When a structure
     contains a pointer to a parameterized structure, the type
     machinery won't automatically detect this (it could, it just
     doesn't yet), so it's necessary to tell it that the pointed-to
     structure should use the same parameters as the outer structure.
     This is done by marking the pointer with the `use_params' option.

`deletable'
     `deletable', when applied to a global variable, indicates that when
     garbage collection runs, there's no need to mark anything pointed
     to by this variable, it can just be set to `NULL' instead.  This
     is used to keep a list of free structures around for re-use.

`if_marked'
     Suppose you want some kinds of object to be unique, and so you put
     them in a hash table.  If garbage collection marks the hash table,
     these objects will never be freed, even if the last other
     reference to them goes away.  GGC has special handling to deal
     with this: if you use the `if_marked' option on a global hash
     table, GGC will call the routine whose name is the parameter to
     the option on each hash table entry.  If the routine returns
     nonzero, the hash table entry will be marked as usual.  If the
     routine returns zero, the hash table entry will be deleted.

     The routine `ggc_marked_p' can be used to determine if an element
     has been marked already; in fact, the usual case is to use
     `if_marked ("ggc_marked_p")'.

`maybe_undef'
     When applied to a field, `maybe_undef' indicates that it's OK if
     the structure that this fields points to is never defined, so long
     as this field is always `NULL'.  This is used to avoid requiring
     backends to define certain optional structures.  It doesn't work
     with language frontends.

`chain_next'
`chain_prev'
     It's helpful for the type machinery to know if objects are often
     chained together in long lists; this lets it generate code that
     uses less stack space by iterating along the list instead of
     recursing down it.  `chain_next' is an expression for the next
     item in the list, `chain_prev' is an expression for the previous
     item.  The machinery requires that taking the next item of the
     previous item gives the original item.

`reorder'
     Some data structures depend on the relative ordering of pointers.
     If the type machinery needs to change that ordering, it will call
     the function referenced by the `reorder' option, before changing
     the pointers in the object that's pointed to by the field the
     option applies to.  The function must be of the type `void ()(void
     *, void *, gt_pointer_operator, void *)'.  The second parameter is
     the pointed-to object; the third parameter is a routine that,
     given a pointer, can update it to its new value.  The fourth
     parameter is a cookie to be passed to the third parameter.  The
     first parameter is the structure that contains the object, or the
     object itself if it is a structure.

     No data structure may depend on the absolute value of pointers.
     Even relying on relative orderings and using `reorder' functions
     can be expensive.  It is better to depend on properties of the
     data, like an ID number or the hash of a string instead.

`special'
     The `special' option is used for those bizarre cases that are just
     too hard to deal with otherwise.  Don't use it for new code.

16.2 Marking Roots for the Garbage Collector
============================================

In addition to keeping track of types, the type machinery also locates
the global variables that the garbage collector starts at.  There are
two syntaxes it accepts to indicate a root:

  1. extern GTY (([options])) [type] ID;

  2. static GTY (([options])) [type] ID;

   These are the only syntaxes that are accepted.  In particular, if you
want to mark a variable that is only declared as

int ID;
 or similar, you should either make it `static' or you should create a
`extern' declaration in a header file somewhere.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Files,  Prev: GGC Roots,  Up: Type Information

16.3 Source Files Containing Type Information
=============================================

Whenever you add `GTY' markers to a new source file, there are three
things you need to do:

  1. You need to add the file to the list of source files the type
     machinery scans.  There are three cases:

       a. For a back-end file, this is usually done automatically; if
          not, you should add it to `target_gtfiles' in the appropriate
          port's entries in `config.gcc'.

       b. For files shared by all front ends, this is done by adding the
          filename to the `GTFILES' variable in `Makefile.in'.

       c. For any other file used by a front end, this is done by
          adding the filename to the `gtfiles' variable defined in
          `config-lang.in'.  For C, the file is `c-config-lang.in'.
          This list should include all files that have GTY macros in
          them that are used in that front end, other than those
          defined in the previous list items.  For example, it is
          common for front end writers to use `c-common.c' and other
          files from the C front end, and these should be included in
          the `gtfiles' variable for such front ends.


  2. If the file was a header file, you'll need to check that it's
     included in the right place to be visible to the generated files.
     For a back-end header file, this should be done automatically.
     For a front-end header file, it needs to be included by the same
     file that includes `gtype-LANG.h'.  For other header files, it
     needs to be included in `gtype-desc.c', which is a generated file,
     so add it to `ifiles' in `open_base_file' in `gengtype.c'.

     For source files that aren't header files, the machinery will
     generate a header file that should be included in the source file
     you just changed.  The file will be called `gt-PATH.h' where PATH
     is the pathname relative to the `gcc' directory with slashes
     replaced by -, so for example the header file to be included in
     `objc/objc-parse.c' is called `gt-objc-objc-parse.c'.  The
     generated header file should be included after everything else in
     the source file.  Don't forget to mention this file as a
     dependency in the `Makefile'!

  3. If a new `gt-PATH.h' file is needed, you need to arrange to add a
     `Makefile' rule that will ensure this file can be built.  This is
     done by making it a dependency of `s-gtype', like this:
     gt-path.h : s-gtype ; @true

   For language frontends, there is another file that needs to be
included somewhere.  It will be called `gtype-LANG.h', where LANG is
the name of the subdirectory the language is contained in.  It will
need `Makefile' rules just like the other generated files.

Funding Free Software
*********************

If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

   Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.

   The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and
expect it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them
partly by how much they give to free software development.  Show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

   To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

   Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.
If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably less
than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

   Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful
too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do,
and what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection
contribute more; major new features or packages contribute the most.

   By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

The GNU Project and GNU/Linux
*****************************

The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like
operating system which is free software: the GNU system.  (GNU is a
recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"; it is pronounced "guh-NEW".)
Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are
now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as "Linux",
they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
     Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

******************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

GCC's command line options are indexed here without any initial `-' or
`--'.  Where an option has both positive and negative forms (such as
`-fOPTION' and `-fno-OPTION'), relevant entries in the manual are
indexed under the most appropriate form; it may sometimes be useful to
look up both forms.
