Notes
-----
This is the legacy 380.xx branch - this branch is no longer actively developed.
All development has now been moved to the NG (New Generation) code branch:

#### I have disabled the issue tracker because apparently people can't read.  The tracker was 90% noise and 10% genuine bug reports, and I grew tired of cleaning it up.

About
-----
Asuswrt-Merlin is an enhanced version of Asuswrt, the firmware used by Asus's modern routers.

The goal of this project is to fix issues and bring some minor functionality adjustments to the 
original Asus firmware.  While some features do get added, this is not the main focus of this project.  
It is not meant to replace existing projects such as Tomato or DD-WRT, but rather to offer an alternative 
for people who prefer the original firmware featureset.

Please consult the Wiki for an up-to-date list of supported models:
