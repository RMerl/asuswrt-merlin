asuswrt-merlin
==============

This is an enhanced version of Asuswrt - the firmware used by all recent Asus routers. 

The goal of this project is to fix issues and bring some minor functionality adjustments to the 
original Asus firmware.  While some features do get added, this is not the main focus of this project.  
It is not meant to replace existing projects such as Tomato or DD-WRT, but rather to offer an alternative 
for people who prefer the original firmware featureset.

At this time, the supported devices are:

- RT-AC56U
- RT-N66U
- RT-AC66U
- RT-AC68U (including revision C1)
- RT-AC68P
- RT-AC87U
- RT-AC3200
- RT-AC88U
- RT-AC3100
- RT-AC5300


NOTE: all the "R" versions (for example RT-N66R) are the same as their 
"U" counterparts, they are just different packages aimed at large 
retailers.  The firmware is 100% compatible with both U and R versions 
of the routers.  Same with the "W" variants that are simply white.


No longer officially supported:
- RT-N16
